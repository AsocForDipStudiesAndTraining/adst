                <p>Interviewed by: W. Haven North </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: May 15, 1996</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is May 15, 1996 and our interview is with Maurice
                        Williams. Maury joined AID in 1958 and served for 20 years before he
                        accepted assignments as Chairman of the Development Assistance Committee
                        based with the OECD in Paris, and later as Assistant Secretary-General of
                        the United Nations World Food Council.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Lets start off by getting a little bit about your background, where you grew up,
                    your schooling and college education, your early work experience: the kind of
                    information that gives a feel for how and why you got into international
                    development.</p>
                <p>Early life, military service and education</p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I was born in 1920 in Canada. My father was working for an American
                    company in Canada where he married a French Canadian girl. When I was five years
                    old, my family moved to Kansas City, Missouri where I grew up. I am a
                    mid-westerner in outlook being imbued with the values and “can-do” spirit of
                    Middle-America in the mid-20th Century - namely that integrity and concentrated
                    efforts yield their own reward.</p>
                <p>Looking back I recall a civics class in the 6th grade which determined me on a
                    public service career. It was the excitement of learning about President
                    Roosevelt's New Deal which influenced me. Later when I had a choice between
                    pursuing an academic career or a position with the State Department in
                    Washington, without hesitation I chose government service.</p>
                <p>After graduating from high school in Kansas City in 1939, I went to Northwestern
                    University in Evanston, Illinois. My first year was eventful for I met the girl
                    I would later marry, was elected class president and gained a necessary
                    scholarship.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>In 1942 I was drafted into the Army and became an officer and instructor at the
                    Infantry School in Fort Benning, Georgia. My overseas experience with the Army
                    was in the European theater. I was stationed in London which was an exciting
                    place to be. Aside from the buzz bombs, London was the center of the allied war
                    effort and the command headquarters of American forces in Europe. That
                    experience in London influenced me to later pursue the study of international
                    relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your position at that time in the military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: As an infantry officer I was initially scheduled to go to the front in
                    Normandy but because of my background as an instructor at Fort Benning , I was
                    retained in England with a small cadre on the Salisbury Plain to retrain general
                    service personnel to infantry. There was a shortage of trained infantry as a
                    result of the high casualties on the Normandy beaches and hedge rows. From there
                    I was assigned to London as a junior officer with the U.S. Supreme Headquarters
                    at Governor Square.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Interesting: how did you find that assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: As I mentioned earlier, London was a very exciting place which opened
                    my mind and interest to international relations. On one of several visits to
                    London, I ran into a former teacher, who responding to my enthusiasm offered me
                    a job with American intelligence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any contact with Eisenhower?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: No, I was too junior for that, but I had a great deal of contact with
                    the British who were generous in offering opportunities to Americans. They had
                    set up the Churchill Club at Westminster, the House of Parliament, where I met
                    British leaders in Parliament, in literature, and in academic life. I found
                    those contacts immensely stimulating.</p>
                <p>At the end of the war, instead of returning to Northwestern to complete an
                    undergraduate degree, I went directly into graduate studies in international
                    relations at the University of Chicago. Chicago offered that opportunity, and
                    the GI Bill made it possible financially, for I had married during the war and
                    we then had a baby son.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: That was in September 1946; I was late in returning home from Europe.
                    Without combat experience I had a low priority for the available transport and
                    used the interval to study for a term at the University of Fribourg in
                    Switzerland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you major in at Chicago? International relations
                        was the subject?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: The University of Chicago was unique at that time in offering
                    inter-disciplinary degrees. You could devise your own program in the social
                    sciences focused on international studies. It also was possible to combine the
                    social sciences and the humanities for a degree in ideas and methods, but not
                    many were that ambitious.</p>
                <p>The University of Chicago was outstanding in its faculty, having recruited renown
                    scholars from Europe during the war. Many were at the top of their respective
                    fields, Hans Morgenthau, for example, taught international politics. He was the
                    outstanding realist in international political theory. I also took monetary
                    theory from Milton Friedman, one of the leading thinkers of the Chicago School
                    of Economics. That was the level of academic instruction; it was tremendously
                    stimulating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a particular emphasis in your program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: International economics was my major, with minor concentration in
                    Russian studies, diplomacy and international law, and international
                    communications. Aside from my regularly enrolled classes, I audited additional
                    courses in history, sociology, and other subjects in the social sciences. The
                    academic offering at Chicago was rich and varied.</p>
                <p>In 1949 I completed a masters degree in international relations and felt well
                    enough prepared to undertake written doctoral examinations, sixteen hours in my
                    major and minor fields. Apparently, I passed with honors for I was told by my
                    faculty advisor that I had scored in the upper ten percent of all Chicago
                    doctoral candidates in the social sciences.</p>
                <p>Despite encouragement to complete a doctoral degree, I did not continue on that
                    path since I had decided on a public service rather than a teaching career. At
                    that time, I was offered an appointment with the economic area of the State
                    Department in Washington; a two year internship with rotating assignments and
                    the promise of accelerated promotion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be in what year now?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: It was during the Truman Administration in the early 1950s. However,
                    Congress believed that the Federal Government had gotten too big during the war,
                    and they froze all new hires. The State Department spokesman assured me that in
                    about a year the freeze would be lifted, and that when it was I would have an
                    assignment with them. I agreed to wait. In the interim, I took a job with the
                    City of Chicago.</p>
                <p>Civil Service Examiner with the City of Chicago</p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: It turned out to be a significant job in terms of experience. At that
                    time, the City of Chicago was governed by a political machine, and almost all
                    (95 per cent) of its employees were temporary appointees who supported the
                    Kelly-Nash machine. Chicago had just elected a reform mayor, Kennelly, who was
                    dedicated to reforming the civil service system, and I was offered the job as
                    Civil Service Examiner with the assignment of setting up my own office and
                    undertaking examinations to weed out the obvious incompetents.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What an assignment!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I asked the Mayor, “Why do you offer this to me? My qualifications are
                    in international relations and I have no experience in personnel
                    administration.”</p>
                <p>He replied: “You have been highly recommended by the University of Chicago. Since
                    you don't have a career to make in personnel administration, we believe you are
                    more likely to be flexible in applying the criteria we seek. Our objective is to
                    provide job security to most of the city's employees while eliminating employees
                    who are clearly incompetent from the city rolls without being overly ambitious
                    in this initial reform.” Challenged, I took the job.</p>
                <p>I recruited a small staff from the University for up to that time there had been
                    no civil service office to set standards and undertake examinations. The
                    experience took me into many departments of the city - from public school cooks
                    and piano tuners to police and fire officials - to work out criteria for
                    examinations. I did this with the help of interested civic groups. For example,
                    for the hospitals run by the city I engaged doctors in private practice to set
                    examination standards. When it came to the police force, I engaged the
                    Northwestern University Police Academy. Everyone cooperated in the effort to
                    upgrade the quality of personnel and services of the city.</p>
                <p>My experience in civil service for the City of Chicago was good preparation for
                    later programming of technical assistance as part of American foreign aid. Also,
                    it gave me perspective on corruption in America relative to the corruption that
                    I would later encounter overseas, as well as practical experience with the
                    process and limits of reform. You could make a certain amount of progress but
                    not too much all at once.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a lot of political tension in that process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Yes some, particularly when we worked with the major departments, such
                    as police and fire, and administered examinations for senior positions like
                    police sergeant and lieutenant. I used to keep those examinations in the freezer
                    of my frig rather than risk leaving them in the office at city hall.</p>
                <p>About a year later, the Department of State said that the freeze on federal
                    hiring had been lifted and offered me a position at the beginning professional
                    level, a GS-7. That was twice the pay for a good deal less responsibility than
                    working for the City of Chicago.</p>
                <p>An internship in the State Department on Strategic Materials</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your first assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: This was during the Truman Administration when Dean Acheson was the
                    Secretary of State. The assignment was with the Division of Natural Resources.
                    It was the period of economic mobilization during the Korean War and the
                    beginning of the Cold War with the Soviet Union. At the end of the Second World
                    War the U.S. had rapidly demobilized, both militarily and economically. There
                    was a reversal of that process, and the economic offices in State were
                    understaffed for the new responsibilities. As an intern I found myself charged
                    with important duties concerning the allocation of natural resources between
                    domestic and overseas requirements.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Natural resources at that time referred to strategic
                        materials?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Strategic materials, that is correct. With the extensive destruction of
                    the economies in Europe and Asia during the Second World War, the U.S. economy
                    constituted half the world's GNP. U.S. resources were in demand both
                    domestically and internationally. We had assumed responsibility for assisting
                    reconstruction in both Europe and the Far East, and the Korean War brought the
                    need for partial remobilization. So there were issues of priorities for U.S.
                    resource allocations.</p>
                <p>Naturally, there was high Congressional interest in the determination of
                    allocation priorities, particularly as they concerned domestic constituencies.
                    There were many Congressional staff and interdepartmental meetings at which I
                    found myself the lone voice on behalf of our foreign policy interests. I learned
                    that the State Department has a tough job in this regard.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>I recall a meeting with Eleanor Dulles, the Department Desk Officer for Berlin
                    and Austria, and two officials from Austria who were seeking a favorable ruling
                    on U.S. resource exports. I rather bluntly said there was little prospect for
                    their request in view of other priorities. Eleanor Dulles - the sister of John
                    Foster Dulles - said to me that “It is also important to consider the charm
                    factor in these determinations.” The Austrian officials smiled happily, and I
                    learned a lesson in diplomacy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you working on a particular strategic material?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: No across the range of strategic materials. I recall sulfur had a
                    particular urgency as one of the materials in short supply. On a single day nine
                    Congressional letters hit my desk having to do with the allocation of sulfur
                    between domestic needs and foreign programs. Congressional mail had to be
                    answered promptly and I was stunned by all these letters at one time.</p>
                <p>The Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, Harold Linder, had a
                    weekly staff meeting with senior State officers concerning mobilization and
                    resource allocation issues. I was asked to sit in and keep a record of the
                    meetings, which exposed me to some of the policy considerations. Harold Linder
                    was reputed to have made a fortune in the New York commodity exchange markets,
                    so he knew the field well. Later Linder became head of the Export-Import
                    Bank.</p>
                <p>Economic intelligence work with the CIA</p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: My career with the State Department came to an abrupt end when I was
                    recalled by the army to go to Korea on my reserve commission as a captain in
                    intelligence, which was the area of my assignment during the war in London.
                    State Department personnel advised me that at my grade as an intern I did not
                    qualify for a deferment with them.</p>
                <p>However, I was advised that if I chose the army would defer me for assignment
                    with CIA, given my record at the University of Chicago in economics and Russian
                    history. A professor of economics from MIT, Max Millikan, was setting up a new
                    office in CIA for economic research on the Soviet Bloc. Millikan met me with an
                    organizational chart of the new office saying “I've got a number of positions to
                    fill; which one would you like?” After four years in the army during the war in
                    Europe, and then with a family and a couple of kids, I had no difficulty in
                    deciding to work with Millikan at CIA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the focus of this mission? Can you recall what
                        they were trying to do with this research program?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: The mission of the new CIA Office of Research and Reports (ORR) was to
                    study Soviet economic capabilities to manage their large military build-up and
                    sustain their civilian economy. They had retained large armed forces after the
                    Second World War and appeared to be building up tremendous tank forces. This was
                    seen as a threat to Western Europe, which at that time had large communist
                    movements in France and Italy. These concerns by the U.S. and its allies led to
                    the origin of NATO and to a strengthening of intelligence services to assess
                    Soviet capabilities and intentions.</p>
                <p>In terms of intelligence on the Soviet Union, we were starting from scratch since
                    the U.S. had never done much academically or otherwise in Russian studies. It
                    would become a boom field during the Cold War. Millikan recruited others with
                    similar academic credentials to mine, mainly from the University of Chicago and
                    Harvard.</p>
                <p>We engaged in straight forward research on what we called “surveys of ignorance”,
                    in other words what did we know and what did we need to know about Soviet
                    economic capabilities? My initial assignment was on trade relations between the
                    Soviet Union and the East European countries, the “captive nations”. I also
                    joined in a team assessment of the overall Soviet economy.</p>
                <p>British intelligence knew more about the Soviet Bloc than we did and there was a
                    close exchange of information with them. Not that the British had focused much
                    on Russia; their main concern had been with Germany obviously. But they had
                    captured the German army intelligence unit, intact with their files, that had
                    specialized on the Soviet economy. Through a combination of British information,
                    what we knew ourselves, and what we learned from the Germans, we put together
                    our first capacity study of the Soviet economy, including how it functioned, its
                    limitations, and what we needed to know in an agenda for continuing
                    research.</p>
                <p>CIA research studies had a strong emphasis on policy related issues in support of
                    the State Department. CIA at that time was headed by Allen Dulles and his
                    brother, John Foster Dulles, was Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>One policy related study which engaged me had to do with whether the American
                    Navy should blockade the coast of China. I had researched economic relations
                    between the Soviet Union and Communist China, the capacity of the Trans-Siberian
                    railroad and what resources had been taken by the Russians out of Manchuria. One
                    specific issue was whether strategic materials were reaching Russia from
                    China.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>U.S. Naval intelligence alleged that substantial strategic materials were going
                    through Hong Kong to China, and being trans-shipped to Russia by way of the
                    Trans-Siberian railroad. Admiral Radford, who was chief of the U.S. Pacific
                    fleet, strongly urged a naval blockade of the coast of China. The British
                    strongly denied such shipments via Hong Kong and opposed a naval blockade. CIA
                    pulled together what we knew about that railroad and Chinese coastal shipping.
                    Then in an effort to verify what materials might be reaching China through Hong
                    Kong, British and U.S. naval authorities conducted a joint operation of boarding
                    ships plying between Hong Kong and mainland China over a period of several
                    weeks.</p>
                <p>I was sent to Hong Kong to monitor the results of the joint operation. What I
                    found was that the officers concerned, American and British, could not agree on
                    the evidence drawn from their boarding some 200 Chinese coast vessels, mainly
                    junks. On my own, I reviewed the manifests from these joint boardings and
                    concluded that no strategic materials were reaching China through Hong Kong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: None at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: None revealed by that joint exercise of American and British naval
                    officers. I mention this because the British were greatly interested in my
                    conclusion. They would later request that I be assigned as the U.S. liaison
                    officer with British intelligence in London, which was a big jump in my
                    career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were still with CIA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: With CIA. My report on coastal trade out of Hong Kong was sent to
                    President Truman and Prime Minister Churchill for a meeting they held in
                    Bermuda. It settled the issue that there would be no U.S. blockade of the coast
                    of China, despite the fact that Admiral Radford was a powerful influence at that
                    time and later became Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the U.S. Navy had other intelligence or they just
                        didn't know?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I believed they cooked their information.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Cooked it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: What I mean is that U.S. Naval intelligence knew what Admiral Radford
                    wanted to hear in support of his policy objectives. It is not unknown in the
                    intelligence business to interpret the facts according to your policy
                    objectives. When you get to a certain level of national policy and intelligence,
                    this is often a problem.</p>
                <p>Assignment to London in joint intelligence work with the British, 1953-1955</p>
                <p>I was assigned to London with a two grade promotion to GS-15 having entered CIA
                    three years earlier as a GS-9. I would spend two years with the Joint
                    Intelligence Bureau (JIB) in Whitehall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were what two years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: From mid-1953 to mid-1955, it was known as the dawn of the new
                    Elizabethan age with the coronation of Queen Elizabeth. The head of the British
                    Joint Intelligence Bureau, Sir Kenneth Strong, had been General Eisenhower's
                    chief of intelligence in the Second World War. And the joint U.K.-U.S. staff
                    approach of the war period had continued. I headed a small American team in
                    combined intelligence work with the British.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this joint group have any particular mission ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: JIB combined civilian and military service personnel for intelligence
                    research and assessments on Communist Bloc countries. Its officers had varied
                    experience in most regions of the British Empire, and they focused their skills
                    and available information from all sources on Soviet military, political and
                    economic capabilities and intentions. It was an interesting experience in
                    comparative government which would later prove valuable in my work with U.S.
                    foreign assistance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you and the British get along?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I went to London with good credentials, having served in London during
                    the Second World War, and I was praised for my recent report on coastal shipping
                    out of Hong Kong. I got along well, and personally gained great respect for the
                    British service, working directly with a retired Brigadier-General Jimmy Way who
                    had extensive Middle East and South Asian experience. Others in the Bureau were
                    drawn from commerce, from universities as well as from the military services. It
                    was truly a combined operational approach, with small but highly experience
                    staffs. We learned a good deal from the British joint staff approach.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To whom did the group report?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Sir Kenneth, the head of Bureau, reported to Prime Minister Harold
                    Macmillan. On one occasion I was invited to join in a briefing of the Prime
                    Minister. There was a continuous exchange of policy related intelligence between
                    the British and CIA, an exchange which it was my task to facilitate.</p>
                <p>Work on national intelligence and Soviet economic assistanc1955-1958</p>
                <p>After two years in London, I returned to Washington and was assigned to the CIA
                    Office of National Estimates which was charged with preparing policy assessments
                    for the President.</p>
                <p>I was a staff economist in the Office which was something of an experiment since
                    national estimates for the most part concerned political issues. The Office was
                    organized geographically, and produced assessments on the current situation and
                    projected developments in foreign countries and regions of special interest to
                    the U.S. It was a rigorous intellectual process of successive reviews of our
                    initial draft estimates by senior government officials in Washington and by
                    outstanding academicians meeting periodically at Princeton University.</p>
                <p>I advised on the country studies and regularly produced an annual assessment of
                    world trends and developments. I also did the first national estimate on which
                    countries had both the capability and political motivation to produce nuclear
                    weapons. We called it the Nth Countries' Assessment.</p>
                <p>Another interesting assignment was a study specifically requested by President
                    Eisenhower on Soviet capabilities and Third World vulnerabilities to Soviet
                    economic assistance. Khrushchev had launched a major aid program, dramatically
                    mixing aid and trade in large credits to non-aligned countries including
                    Afghanistan, Egypt and India. President Eisenhower was deeply concerned with
                    this Soviet “economic penetration” of the Third World and its challenge to U.S.
                    interests. I was assigned to do this study with a personal friend of the
                    president, Joe Dodge of Detroit. He was pleased to let me write the report and
                    was generous in acknowledging my contribution.</p>
                <p>When we were invited to present the results of the study to President Eisenhower
                    at a meeting of his full Cabinet, Joe Dodge introduced me as the fellow who had
                    done the study and could answer all the questions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What an opportunity! How did the study come out? I mean
                        can you remember much of the general conclusion of your study and the points
                        you were trying to make?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: The Soviet Union had taken a bold approach in offering hundreds of
                    millions of dollars in trade credits repayable in developing country exports.
                    Soviet aid was largely in capital equipment and arms, promising the prospect of
                    accelerated industrialization under Soviet type command economic planning and
                    mobilization - known as “the Russian model of development.” Their objectives and
                    criteria were far more politically motivated than the U.S. assistance programs.
                    Also, their aid credits were repayable in local currency over a long term, in
                    effect tying up local resources in repayment obligations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Barter arrangement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Yes barter trade arrangements. It was indeed as President Eisenhower
                    had suspected, economic penetration. The terms of repayment, while apparently
                    favorable for recipients, had the potential of gaining important control over
                    their economies. The Soviet Union clearly had the economic capacity to undertake
                    such aid programs, selectively, where it was politically important to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have a sense that such aid was both effective
                        economically and politically ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: It was immediately effective politically and the capital equipment
                    delivered by the Soviet was real enough. The Soviet offer to help countries
                    industrialize had tremendous appeal, like their offer of steel mills. However,
                    the Soviet approach distorted the development process with its over emphasis on
                    heavy industry at the expense of agriculture. They held up their system of state
                    planning as highly successful for industrial development. The Soviet aid
                    initiative presented a real challenge to American foreign and aid policies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the reaction to your report?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: There was great interest in what we had to say. There was not a lengthy
                    debate of the subject at the President's Cabinet meeting, but the effects were
                    far reaching in the ensuing evaluation of our own aid programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You saw some of the ramifications of this in subsequent
                        policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Yes, in fact the redirection of the U.S. aid program and the
                    restructuring of the new Agency for International Development (AID) was a
                    reaction to that assessment. We would meet the Soviet challenge and AID was set
                    up to do that.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll talk about that later but your study provided very
                        important points.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: It stimulated my interest in foreign aid as an instrument of our
                    foreign policy and led to my transfer from CIA to the American aid agency.</p>
                <p>I recall an interesting incident at the President's cabinet meeting. When I
                    entered the cabinet room with Joe Dodge, the meeting was already in progress and
                    they were discussing U.S. Policy toward Eastern Europe. The issue concerned
                    liberating those captive nations from Soviet control. I heard the President ask
                    Attorney General Brownell if it was possible to do what had been proposed. I
                    hadn't heard the precise proposal, but heard Brownell reply “No, Mr. President,
                    that would be illegal.” Whereupon President Eisenhower flung the pencil he held
                    in hand on the table and exclaimed, “God dammit, that's the trouble with this
                    government; every time you have a good idea, you can't do it.”</p>
                <p>I was stunned. Here was the President of the United States, an honored war hero,
                    who also encountered frustration in government work, in his case regarding the
                    limits of presidential power. These limits had earlier been implied by President
                    Truman when he was quoted as saying, “Wait until Ike gets here and gives orders
                    and he finds that nothing happens.” Q: Yes, I remember that well.</p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: In the following year I encountered a set back in my work with the
                    Office of National Estimates. I was assigned the initial draft of a five year
                    projection of the future of Western Europe. The war for Algerian independence
                    was tearing France apart politically and bleeding it economically. Progress in
                    the Common Market for economic cooperation between France and West Germany was
                    blocked and the future stability of Western Europe was in doubt.</p>
                <p>Over the five year period, I projected an optimistic outlook with de Gaulle
                    achieving a political settlement both domestically in France and with Algeria,
                    and good progress in rapprochement between France and West Germany in the
                    European Common Market. This would prove correct, but at the time my estimate
                    did not appear creditable to the U.S. senior intelligence establishment, many of
                    whom had known de Gaulle personally during the war and had a low regard for his
                    abilities.</p>
                <p>I was summarily dismissed from the estimate which was rewritten by others with a
                    much more uncertain outlook. The lesson was that for intelligence projections,
                    it was not enough to be right, you also had to be convincing and creditable to
                    your policy audience. I had failed that test and decided it was time to leave
                    CIA. Given my new found interest in foreign aid I took an assignment with the
                    Mutual Security Agency (MSA), the predecessor agency of AID.</p>
                <p>Joined the Mutual Security Agency in Iran</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>In response to the competition with the Soviet Union, the Eisenhower
                    administration expanded the Point Four technical assistance program of President
                    Truman to include military and capital assistance in support of defensive
                    alliances against Soviet expansion. U.S. alliances with developing countries
                    extended from Greece through Turkey, Iran, Pakistan to East Asian countries. To
                    emphasize the security thrust of the program, the International Cooperation
                    Administration (ICA) was retitled the Mutual Security Agency (MSA). Countries
                    allied with the United States received large-scale economic and military
                    assistance; those not allied received technical assistance.</p>
                <p>In 1958 I went to Tehran as the Assistant Director for Program with the U.S.
                    Operations Mission (USOM). It was a large mission administering annually some
                    $10 million in Point Four-type technical assistance, $40 million in budget
                    support with a staff of about 300 Americans - both direct hire and contract -
                    organized in major functional divisions: agriculture, community development,
                    education, health, industry, public administration, and media
                    communications.</p>
                <p>Iran had high political priority for U.S. foreign policy, but the aid program was
                    in serious trouble with the Congress. Investigations by Congressman Porter Hardy
                    had turned up many program failings and weaknesses. The U.S. had allocated large
                    aid funds to Iran largely on the political criteria of bolstering the Shah and
                    economy following the 1953 collapse of the Mossadegh government. As prime
                    minister, Mossadegh had nationalized the huge foreign oil holdings in Iran and
                    almost succeeded in deposing the Shah. U.S. political intervention had succeeded
                    in putting the Shah back on his throne and reversing the nationalization of the
                    oil investments of British and American companies.</p>
                <p>However, the collapse of a popular nationalist movement and several years without
                    oil revenues created a political crisis and economic recession. In these
                    circumstances, the large aid mission and much economic assistance had been
                    justified as a means of building political support for the Shah. But the
                    important political rationale for aid allocations had overridden concern about
                    economic feasibility, and hastily conceived and unfinished projects were spread
                    throughout the country even as late as 1958.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was our program to achieve that political
                        objective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: One means was by a high profile American technical assistance presence
                    throughout the country, backed up by fairly substantial capital transfers, as
                    well as military equipment and a large American military assistance group. Given
                    the overriding political priority, we applied every instrument we had. There
                    were American advisors at the side of every economic minister and large aid
                    offices in the nine provinces or ostans, including Tabriz, Meshed, Sanandaj,
                    Isfahan, Shiraz. The Mission was deeply involved in working with the government
                    at all levels.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>There was a kind of pump-priming process by rapidly funding projects and
                    activities through a special funding arrangement, a Master Joint Fund, which I
                    gather was adapted from earlier aid experience with servicios in Latin America.
                    The monies we had put into the Master Joint Fund were jointly controlled by a
                    special USOM and Iranian committee, outside the financial systems of either
                    government. Hence, there was great flexibility in the use of the funds with
                    limited accountability.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It had its own rules, personnel policies, etc.-a form of
                        shadow government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: It was in fact a shadow or separate government with flexibility to hire
                    its own personnel, provide budget support to ministries, or whatever else was
                    believed to be useful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were a large number of Iranians employed by it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: There were about a thousand Iranian employees of the master joint
                    fund.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was it felt necessary to create this Master Joint
                        Fund?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I believe it was a device which provided flexibility and speed in fund
                    allocations, given the political priority to demonstrate immediate activity. You
                    could support the large technical assistance type programs with a lot of capital
                    assistance. You could build up staffs in the government ministries like
                    agriculture, launch an entirely new Ministry of Health, as well build-up the
                    governors' offices in the provinces. It was quite an operation.</p>
                <p>However, the system was in trouble when I arrived on the scene because so many
                    projects had been started, so much equipment had been shipped for them, and as I
                    mentioned many of these projects had not been completed. Congressman Hardy made
                    a big thing about “the road that went nowhere”, about over-equipped vocational
                    training facilities without any hookup to electric power or trained staff to run
                    them. Things were done rapidly for political impact using aid instruments and
                    budget support through the Master Joint Fund. The whole process had been under
                    aid mission direction with too little regard for the role of the Iranian
                    ministries, which admittedly were not very efficient.</p>
                <p>My instructions in Washington were to do what I could as mission program officer
                    to get all this straightened out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the director at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Harry Brenn, a retired colonel, who had made a reputation for himself
                    in the Philippines as Director of the ICA Mission. When Magsaysay came out of
                    the jungle in the end of the war, Harry Brenn was there on military assignment
                    and befriended him. President Magsaysay was strongly pro-American. Brenn had
                    been a highly successful aid mission director in the Philippines, and on this
                    basis was sent to Iran. However, Iran was a totally different situation and
                    culture from the Philippines.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you go about the task of reform?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I only speak of my instructions. The Program Office I headed had never
                    been very involved in program direction. It had been more of an office for
                    economic reporting and compiling the program requests of the functional
                    technical divisions, each of which had its own program officer. Consequently, I
                    did not have a position of much influence in the Mission; the real power was
                    exercised by the Assistant Director for Operations under the oversight of the
                    Mission Director. It was structured as an operations mission. I didn't get hold
                    of the program very quickly.</p>
                <p>However, I became well acquainted with the Master Joint Fund and gradually
                    assumed responsibility for that shadow government as it affected the mission
                    programs. And I began to assess priorities. My background in CIA policy
                    assessments was helpful because there were major policy issues underlying the
                    Mission program and U.S. relations with the Iranian government.</p>
                <p>My basic assessment was that U.S. policy over-emphasized the military building of
                    the Iranian armed forces to the extent that it was undermining the economy. The
                    Iranian Government was highly compartmentalized and with the recovery of oil
                    revenues, increased resources were going mainly to the military and to large
                    infrastructure projects. The USAID Mission was over-exposed in activities which
                    were normally those of the traditional Iranian ministries but with minimum
                    involvement on their part, financially or otherwise. Without more direct Iran
                    Government involvement, the USAID program was largely failing in its mission to
                    build public support for the Shah and his government.</p>
                <p>I began to write some of this into the program documents and I also sent my
                    assessment of the political situation and the role of the aid mission by
                    personal letters to my good friend, Jim Grant, who was in the State Department
                    as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Near East area (NEA). I later found that my
                    letters were widely circulated in State, and to the White House, Budget Bureau -
                    and eventually to the U.S. Ambassador in Iran.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Julius Holmes was a career diplomat who had been General Eisenhower's
                    political adviser in the North African campaign and was well connected
                    politically in Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>The Ambassador called me over and said, “I see you have been writing letters to
                    Washington”. I acknowledged that I had been writing to my friend Jim Grant about
                    things that Washington needed to know and that couldn't be easily expressed in
                    formal program documents. The Ambassador said he found my letters “fairly
                    interesting”; he would instruct Harry Brenn, the USOM Mission Director to bring
                    me to the Ambassador's staff meetings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a positive reaction; not a typical response in
                        that kind of situation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I believe the Ambassador decided to co-opt me. I could have been in
                    real trouble. Apparently he had a complete set of my letters and he may have
                    known that they were well regarded in Washington - as I learned later. Also, the
                    political situation in Iran was difficult and tenuous. The fact that the aid
                    mission was spread so widely throughout the country provided a basis for
                    political and economic assessments which the Embassy staff lacked.</p>
                <p>Whatever the reasons, the Ambassador brought me into his inner circle of
                    advisors. From that point on I was a member of his senior staff, included in the
                    weekly luncheon with the heads of the different U.S. missions: military,
                    information agency, USOM and his senior officers. This group was known as the
                    country team.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there changes that began to evolve in the program
                        along with this interaction with the Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: It strengthened my programming role within the aid mission. Also,
                    inclusion in the Ambassador's Country Team gave me a different perspective of
                    the Shah and his inner circle. The Shah's moods of deep depression were a
                    continuing concern of the ambassador; at country team meetings he spent a lot of
                    time talking about them. This was a totally authoritarian government with an
                    unstable leader. I gained the impression that our ambassador had an important
                    role in helping to maintain the Shah's equilibrium. Or was it possible that the
                    Shah was play-acting to manipulate the ambassador?. The Iranians are a
                    complicated and clever people with a culture quite alien to our own.</p>
                <p>Shortly thereafter the Ambassador asked me to accompany him to Washington on a
                    mission to renew Iranian budget support which had been running $40,000,000
                    annually. He had the political influence in State to get it over the opposition
                    of the Mutual Security Agency. Since I was with the Ambassador, it appeared that
                    I was supporting him when in fact I had been coopted, There was deep criticism
                    of continuing budget support to Iran in the aid agency. However, Doc FitzGerald,
                    who was the operational deputy of MSA announced they wanted “Maury Williams
                    protected from this criticism” since the decision had been forced by State.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were under fire from some of your other colleagues, I
                        imagine?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Exactly. Ambassador Holmes got his way because the political priority
                    was very high. And it probably made a difference that he was a friend of
                    President Eisenhower.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the core of the issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I suspect the Ambassador had been leveraged by the Shah to continue the
                    annual level of budget support despite the recovery of Iran's oil revenues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a direct grant, a transfer of funds?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: A direct cash transfer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No policy reform measures?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Nothing! Nothing at all, beyond political criteria. The MSA agency was
                    very unhappy with this given the need for program reform and continuing
                    Congressional attacks on the Iran aid program. And I had been totally coopted by
                    the Ambassador. But the fact that FitzGerald, as the deputy of the aid agency,
                    sought to protect me, that really impressed mWhen you have support like that,
                    you can be bolder on reform issues.</p>
                <p>Secretary of State John Foster Dulles visited Iran during my tour. He spent 40
                    hours in Tehran and made a commitment for a further $40,000,000 which MSA had to
                    cough up, this time for the military budget. I was asked to work out some
                    justifiable attribution for these funds in the military budget. In the Iranian
                    Defense Ministry I located their budget officer, a Colonel Goofuri who claimed
                    that there was no approved written budget but that he could relate orally how
                    their funds were being spent. It was like a housewife speaking of household
                    expenditures, and I couldn't make heads or tails of it.</p>
                <p>I reported to Washington that this aid would simply have to be attributed as
                    “general troop support”, and that before any U.S. funds were released we should
                    insist that the Iranian Defense Ministry produce a written budget, with our
                    technical help if necessary. This was done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the economic side was there an attribution at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: No, the grant went directly to the Defense Ministry.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>The economic situation in Iran at that time was that oil revenues were flowing
                    again with the reestablishment of Iran into the oil markets after the reversal
                    on nationalization of oil. But the flow was slow relative to budget needs which
                    kept growing. In terms of budgets Iran had three governments: the traditional
                    economic ministries which USOM dealt with; the security ministries which the
                    Shah looked after directly (armed forces, intelligence and foreign ministry).
                    And then there was the Plan Organization which was being set up as a result of
                    U.S. pressure on Iran allocate a percentage of the oil revenues for development.
                    That arrangement had been negotiated by World Bank President Eugene Black.</p>
                <p>The intention was to build competence for development in a separate Plan
                    Organization because there was limited competence in the traditional economic
                    ministries. The Plan Organization would have a central planning unit largely
                    staffed by American- trained Iranian economists, assisted by an American Harvard
                    Advisory Group, all of whom had arrived in Tehran about the I had. In contrast
                    to the relatively insulated Plan Organization, the US Operating Mission worked
                    directly with the traditional economic ministries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Plan Organization have any influence over the
                        traditional ministries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: No, there was great rivalry between them. The Plan Organization built
                    its own technical capabilities, largely with contract groups, and ignored the
                    regular ministries because they didn't want to put money through that rat hole,
                    they said. That was some of the dynamics of the situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there mainly a macro economics focus.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: No, you couldn't do much macro economics: there weren't enough
                    statistics available. One of the aid mission's projects was directed to
                    developing statistical systems. The Iranian economy comprised an oil-based
                    enclave, traditional peasant agriculture, some very rich landowners, a
                    mercantile bazaar class, minor manufacturing and traditional crafts such as
                    weaving wonderful Persian rugs. Oil provided a resource potential with
                    continuous political wrangling among the Shah's Court, traditional economic
                    ministries, and the security agencies over oil revenue allocations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you characterize the development thrust of the
                        program in terms of the more traditional development objectives and the
                        effectiveness of the program? What were we doing or what were we able to
                        accomplish?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: The aid mission focused on technical assistance projects with major
                    American staffs and ambitious programs in agriculture, health, education, and
                    public administration. There also were projects in community development,
                    industry, labor, and communications. The mission program spanned all the
                    economic sectors and ministries. There were large training programs, although
                    the effects were not immediate. The programs were heavily rural and agriculture
                    based, working through provincial offices.</p>
                <p>Mission assistance in public health was outstanding, building a health ministry
                    from scratch, rural health clinics and staffing a major hospital complex in
                    Shiraz. Important assistance was being provided in education including primary
                    education, technical vocational training, and a major agricultural college.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In agriculture, was this a time when the major emphasis
                        was on wheat production?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: No, it was before the green revolution technology was available.
                    Agricultural extension was important but the results were not dramatic, compared
                    with what would come later. Rural credit and water management were the pillars
                    of the agricultural program. Community development did important work in village
                    organization and sanitation. And the public administration program focused on
                    training managers and providing advisory services at all levels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was one of the largest public administration programs
                        we've ever had.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: It was indeed</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your assessment of that program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Despite a comprehensive effort in public administration, the program on
                    the whole was not very successful. Our advisors were up against traditional
                    interests. There were great tensions within government agencies between the
                    newly trained modernizers and the overwhelming mass of traditionalists. Iranians
                    who were trying to do things in a new way were at risk in their own
                    establishments and the support of foreign advisors was not always helpful to
                    them. Inducing change in a traditional society is a slow process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the government particularly supportive of the rural
                        orientation of the development activity? The issue of poverty, was that an
                        issue of concern?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: That was a central objective of the USAID program. One of the projects
                    was for the redistribution of the Shah's crown lands. Agricultural and community
                    development programs were naturally concerned with rural change and development.
                    Community development, however, was part of the Interior Ministry which also had
                    security responsibilities. Our public administration program sought to
                    decentralize authority to the provinces and to the cities and significant
                    progress was being made in encouraging local autonomy, until the Ministry of
                    Interior concluded that this was dangerous; at the stroke of the Shah's pen all
                    the progress that had been made in local autonomy was wiped out. Such a large
                    and widely engaged American aid mission had a modernizing influence certainly,
                    but the Iranian officials while cooperating with us, were quite selective in
                    taking what they thought was helpful to them.</p>
                <p>One of the U.S. objectives was to bolster the Shah's weak political support and
                    to direct the aid program to that end. Our analysis was that people were truly
                    interested in the health and education of their children, and in improved
                    nutrition. It was also helpful to encourage the redistribution of lands which
                    were held by very large landowners including the crown. One of the Shah's
                    ministers, for example, had holdings as large as [the state of] Switzerland. We
                    were trying to push reforms through these kinds of efforts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any progress made in the crown
                        distribution?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Yes, there was slow progress. We would provide technical support for
                    distribution of some of the crown lands and periodically there would be a
                    redistribution ceremony. But all authority was centralized with the Shah. This
                    is where the ambassador's relationship with the Shah, and my relationship with
                    the ambassador proved helpful in terms of what progress could be encouraged in
                    getting the Shah to understand that we were really trying to help build his
                    political support. But then there was the question of the Shah's moods as to how
                    much progress could be made. But if we could get the Shah to issue the
                    instruction, then crown lands could be distributed, and various other things
                    could be done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The government responded to the Shah's commands?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: The government would respond to the Shah's commands, and the
                    Ambassador's influence with the Shah was helpful. There were advantages and
                    disadvantages to working with an authoritarian government. When you got the
                    autocrat to agree your program moved forward. When you couldn't get his
                    agreement, nothing happened. There is not much political development in that
                    situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you characterize what you learned from that very
                        interesting time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I certainly was fairly critical of American foreign policy for being so
                    militarily oriented. If popular support was to be built, it required a more
                    economic development focus and less on supporting the Shah's military
                    aspirations. Some of this got back in my letters to Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do those letters still exist?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I don't have them, and don't know whether they exist or not. I didn't
                    keep record, maybe I should have.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very historic letters.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Their significance may have been to contribute to a reevaluation of
                    U.S. foreign aid policy toward Iran. It was said that the letters were well
                    regarded in Washington and later proved to be in line with the reappraisal of
                    aid policy by President Kennedy's administration. Even before Kennedy was
                    elected President, there was a consensus in Washington that our policy toward
                    Iran was in need of major revision.</p>
                <p>I was recalled to Washington at the completion of a two year tour. It seemed to
                    me that my contribution had been minimal, the work was exacting but with very
                    limited progress. At every turn one was battling strong division chiefs within
                    the mission, entrenched interests in the ministries, political foreign policy
                    “imperatives.” What I concluded is that you needed enough political priority to
                    get the aid money and a low enough political priority to be able to allocate it
                    sensibly. When the political priority was too high you had much less influence
                    over how the aid was allocated. And that was pretty much the situation in
                    Iran.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If it wasn't high enough, you didn't get the money.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: When you have a large mission of Americans overseas it becomes a
                    community in itself, highly visible and somewhat insular with a lot of
                    socializing. When I first arrived in Tehran I made an informal survey of what
                    had brought Americans to Iran in the aid program, why they thought they were
                    there.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>I found that they divided into three general categories. There were the
                    missionary types, people who had joined the aid program to do good works. There
                    were straight adventurers who were there for the excitement of being in a
                    foreign country. Then there were what I call the escapists, people who had
                    problems at home and were escaping from them. Most dramatically this was
                    illustrated by one person's response to my question, “What brought you to Iran
                    with the aid program?” He said “I found my wife in bed with another man, beat
                    him up, and joined foreign aid.” So for some aid was a kind of a foreign legion.
                    While I didn't work out the proportions exactly, it seemed to me that the groups
                    constituted rough thirds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your view of the competence of these people in
                        their work in development?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: They brought real skills from the American experience. They were
                    competent in their respective fields, having been hired as such. Generally, they
                    were not very competent in cultural understanding. Of course, Iran was a rather
                    difficult culture, a very old culture, a very unique one, as inscrutable as the
                    Chinese in many ways being such an autonomous and ancient culture. We were not
                    well equipped to deal with that, neither myself nor others of the mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any attempt to compensate for that or address
                        that situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: No, not really. That would come later, cultural orientation. I had a
                    week's briefing in Washington prior to being sent into the program job with
                    instructions to “straighten up the mess.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much contact with the Iranian people? Or did
                        the Mission people have contact with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: As I mentioned, we had American advisers at the side of every minister
                    and deeply involved in government ministries and provincial offices, so our
                    advisors had a lot of contact. We were far better off in that respect than the
                    State Department Embassy people since we were really embedded into the Iranian
                    structure institutionally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about social relations?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Somewhat formal and based on working relationships. The close
                    relationships that I had were with the new team of Iranian officials who had
                    been educated in the United States, who came into the Plan Organization and some
                    other agencies. A number of them had American wives. These became close friends
                    and associates; they were people like myself trying to deal with a rather
                    difficult situation in a programmatic sense.</p>
                <p>The Mission was very much oriented toward operations, and the rivalries within
                    the mission were strong. The division chiefs were like dukes of Burgundy, more
                    powerful than the king of France, or in this case the mission director. In terms
                    of program functions, there was an internal struggle between myself and the
                    assistant director for operations, which gradually eased as I gained influence
                    in my relations with the Ambassador and the Mission Director.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that's very helpful. It gives an interesting
                        picture of the era when there were big aid missions. Well, is there anything
                        more about the Iran experience that influenced your view of the development
                        process and the aid business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Certainly it deepened my experience in dealing with a society in
                    transition. I learned how tough, how difficult development is with the
                    instruments that we had. The Iranian experience may have misled me into thinking
                    that the way to get progress was to have somebody in a position of authority to
                    order it, because so much of what we were able to achieve in Iran was through
                    persuasion of highly authoritarian government officials. For example, I learned
                    that you used as many channels to the decision maker as you could, to get the
                    decisions you wanted. Not a very democratic process, but one that met American
                    interests.</p>
                <p>At the end of two years, I was called back to Washington in the summer of 1960,
                    before the presidential election. I became the program officer for the Near East
                    and South Asia in the Mutual Security Agency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was just before AID was formed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Yes, reassessments were being undertaken even before Kennedy was
                    elected. After the election, I became very much involved in the redirection of
                    the aid Program.</p>
                <p>Member of the task force on reforming assistance and the creation of AID-1960</p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: President Kennedy's first appointment of Administrator of the Mutual
                    Security Agency was Harry Labouisse, who began the process of reforming the aid
                    program away from its heavy emphasis on security goals to more broadly
                    supporting development objectives. I was privileged to accompany Labouisse in
                    his testimony to Congress on the proposed new aid concepts.</p>

                <p>While Labouisse fully supported a reform of the aid program, he believed this
                    could best be done in the framework of the existing aid agency. In his judgement
                    a total reorganization of MSA would be unduly disruptive. However, the people
                    around Kennedy wanted to uproot MSA and reorganize it completely. That is what
                    happened. Labouisse resigned over the issue. He was a true professional who
                    believed that good aid policies and experienced aid officers were more important
                    than organizational structures. He was not entirely wrong for agencies do lose a
                    lot of momentum when they reorganize, and you hope that the improved political
                    image of a new agency offsets that loss.</p>
                <p>The task force that was then set up for the redirection of aid and the
                    organization of a new aid agency was headed by Max Millikan who was head of the
                    Economics Department at MIT. Millikan and Walt Rostow, also at MIT, had
                    developed assessments of the economic competition between the Soviet Union and
                    Free World for the hearts and minds of developing countries. I had known
                    Millikan earlier in CIA when he had recruited me for the then new office of
                    economic research.</p>
                <p>I was a member of Millikan's task force for the reform of the aid program. As the
                    program officer for the Near East, South Asia it was my task to apply the
                    knowledge of that region to the new aid criteria that were being formulated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the driving forces and concepts that led to the
                        way the AID was shaped and ordered?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: The aid program of President Kennedy's Administration was directed to
                    substantially step up the level of economic aid to Third World countries, those
                    allied with us and non-aligned as well, on a sustained basis in order to
                    accelerate their social and economic development. The change in approach was
                    based on an assessment that the aid policy of the Eisenhower Administration was
                    too narrowly focused on building military alliances in containment of Soviet
                    military aggression, whereas the real threat was in the economic competition
                    between the capitalist and communist systems for modernization of the Third
                    World, including non-aligned countries like India and Indonesia.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>This policy assessment drew on the analysis which I had done earlier on the
                    objectives and methods of Soviet economic aid, and that we needed to meet that
                    challenge head on. In this engagement the U.S. would mobilize its economic and
                    technical resources, its food surpluses with Pl 480, and its youth in the Peace
                    Corp. The thrust was to accelerate structural transformation of Third World
                    economies for self-sustaining growth through the stimulus of large-scale
                    economic assistance to meet critical shortages of investment capital, as well as
                    shortages of food and other consumer goods. As an integral part of this approach
                    the U.S. Government sought more burden-sharing by its Free World allies, and
                    accompanying self-help commitments by developing country recipients.</p>
                <p>Programming was to be on a country rather than sectoral basis and multi-year
                    reciprocal commitments were to ensure improved performance for mutually agreed
                    reforms. This called for a complete redirection of American aid, away from the
                    narrow military security criteria that had been so strong in the John Foster
                    Dulles period. It was a pretty exciting time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a concept of development that we were trying to
                        support as contrasted with the more political/economic strategies? Did we
                        have a particular concept of how development should take place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: It was certainly to open the way for our system of private enterprise
                    investment, although we were convinced that at least initially public capital
                    assistance, and related technical assistance, were critically important. .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Rostow's stages of growth?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Yes, but in order to jump-start self sustaining growth you needed to
                    release the constraint on domestic capital resource mobilizations, as well as
                    the foreign exchange constraints. This was the double gap analysis. And you
                    needed to encourage country program planning specifically directed to capital
                    investment while meeting essential consumer needs. This meant recipient country
                    commitments to accept these priorities. Meeting peoples' needs in health and
                    education and food was always explicit in our technical assistance programs, but
                    they would be more effectively met with sustained economic development. The
                    transfer of American know-how didn't achieve your objective without a
                    reorientation of developing country priorities backed by capital investment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: More emphasis on the economic growth?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: That certainly. The redirected aid approach also emphasized multi-year
                    programming and commitments so that developing countries could improve their
                    performance. And we were going to combine resources - food, capital assistance,
                    technical assistance - in an integrated approach focused on country
                    programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the time of the long range assistance strategy, I
                        believe. Was there one in the area you were working with? Did you have such
                        a strategy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: It was my task as program officer for the Near East and South Asia to
                    demonstrate the application of these criteria in an effort to reorient each of
                    the programs in our region, both by communications to our field missions and for
                    the Congressional presentation.</p>
                <p>In a real sense, the new aid program approach of the Kennedy Administration was
                    well suited to the requirements of accelerating development by India, with
                    prospects for major resources in multi-year commitments related to country
                    planning. It was even said that the Kennedy program was more oriented to India
                    than any other country. There was something in that because there was certainly
                    a high interest in supporting democratic India and Chester Bowles as ambassador
                    to India was effective in making that case.</p>
                <p>There were other countries where the criteria didn't seem to apply very well at
                    all, such as Afghanistan. However, that didn't stop Henry Bryoade, our
                    ambassador in Kabul, from claiming large- scale multi-year aid commitments on
                    behalf of Afghanistan. So there was a lot of tension concerning the programming
                    criteria and their application to specific countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tunisia was one of the countries that did, I believe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Yes, Tunisia clearly met the development and self-help criteria. But we
                    managed to terminate our aid programs in Greece and Lebanon over the opposition
                    of the State Department. These countries were doing reasonably well economically
                    at that time, and the new criteria was to allocate aid for development rather
                    than short-term political objectives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the organizational dimensions and reasoning
                        behind them? You did mention that a little bit but... MSA was very
                        functional.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: In the reorganization, the functional technical divisions were broken
                    up and their personnel assigned to the regional bureaus. AID was a completely
                    new agency and the programming concepts meant that you would take a broader
                    economic approach. Each region had a complete complement of technical and
                    programming staffs, Africa, Latin America, the Far East as well as NESA. If you
                    were going to encourage integrated country programs you had to integrate the
                    available aid instruments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Development Loan Fund?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Similarly the staff of the Development Loan Fund were fully integrated
                    into the individual AID regional bureaus. So it was a total reorganization and a
                    total change in the manner in which the new AID agency would function.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You still had a strong private sector orientation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Yes, the private sector was always there, both in our ideology and
                    programming efforts. The AID reorganization included a Private Sector Bureau
                    which worked closely with each of the regional bureaus as well as with the
                    Export-Import Bank and the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank.
                    It was a pretty exciting time to be a program director: big resources, major
                    program staffs, and integrated country programming. You felt it was possible to
                    make a difference.</p>
                <p>Of course, it was a real job to reorient each of our country programs to the new
                    programming approach. NESA was a major region with many countries and
                    substantial increases in aid were being recommended to the Congress. I remember
                    working all night to meet the deadline for getting these country program in
                    reasonable shape for the Congressional Presentation. In the morning when my
                    staff arrived for work they found me fast asleep at my desk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much problem with the State Department in
                        this transition process? Did you find it resistant or influence
                        dominated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: No, not initially at least, since it was clearly the President's
                    decision. Problems would come later in specific country cases. The AID Assistant
                    Administrators were set up with parallel authority to the regional Assistant
                    Secretaries in State. Secretary of State Dean Rusk was fully behind the new AID
                    approach. You were meant to get along; and if there were disagreements between
                    State and AID, the issue in question would go to the Secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the relationship with the State Department was not
                        integrated. It was still a separate agency?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: AID was close to State in policy orientation, as Bill Gaud use to put
                    it “AID followed the flag.” But were not integrated with State in the
                    organizational sense.</p>
                <p>That was my Washington experience during that transitional year. Then I returned
                    to Iran for a second tour.</p>
                <p>Return to Iran as Deputy Mission Director, 1961-1963</p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Iran was still politically a high priority country for the United
                    States. President Kennedy had set up a Task Force specifically to review our
                    policy toward Iran; as a member of the Task Force I made a number of
                    recommendations. As a result I was sent back as deputy director of the USAID
                    Mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. Who were you working for at that time? Who was the
                        mission director?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Harry Brenn was still there but he was at the end of his tour. Robert
                    Macy, who had been head of the Budget Bureau, was scheduled to become Mission
                    Director.</p>
                <p>I found myself back in Iran with a good deal more authority than I had the first
                    time around; it was more urgent than ever to reshape the program according to
                    the new criteria - not entirely easy with such a large technical mission deeply
                    embedded in on-going activities and unfinished projects.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, I began to reshape the technical assistance projects, sorting out
                    which we would write off and which we would make a major effort to integrate
                    into the Iranian Government, given their substantial oil revenues. It was
                    essentially sectoral reprogramming since we were not going to put capital
                    assistance into Iran. The objective was to scale back the Mission, lower its
                    profile of involvement in the Iranian Government structure, and focus on fewer
                    clear priorities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you make some decisions about the Master Joint Fund at
                        that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: We terminated it as we sought to reduce our operational involvement.
                    There was a lot of sorting out with the Iranian Government, pressing them to
                    take over important projects in the social sector, terminating others, and
                    bringing down the size of the technical mission substantially. It did not make
                    me popular, but finally I had the authority and experience to do what I believed
                    needed to be done.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you trying to do apart from bringing down the
                        size? What was the developmental orientation you were trying to bring
                        about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: The capital development was now with the Plan Organization so we were
                    working very closely with them. The political priority was to integrate the
                    populist elements of the USAID program into the Iranian government in what we
                    jointly agreed was “the Shah's white revolution.” The white revolution involved
                    stepping up the distribution of crown lands, dealing with rural development in a
                    more populist way, getting to the smaller farmers and peasants, and improving
                    their access to health clinics and the educational programs. Basically the
                    thrust was the white revolution were the populist elements of the U.S. program
                    integrated into the Iranian agencies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a lot of emphasis on decentralization and the
                        decentralized programs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: No, there was no opening for it. So we stayed with the priorities I
                    just stated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you still have the regional offices?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Yes, because they were completing projects that needed to be completed.
                    While their operations were cut back, we kept the structure of the regional
                    offices to get the kind of turnaround we wanted in the program.</p>
                <p>Vice President Johnson came to visit the aid mission in Iran. That was one of the
                    high points. He cabled ahead of his arrival that he wanted to see villages
                    before development had touched them, and after they had been improved by aid
                    programs, so that he could see what progress was being made in the rural
                    development. I went to the Minister of Agriculture, whom we worked with closely,
                    and told him of this requirement. He replied “I can't show your Vice President
                    areas that are totally undeveloped. I would lose my job if I did that.”</p>
                <p>Vice President Johnson demonstrated to the Iranians a new style of political
                    campaigning, by mingling with the crowd and shaking many hands. The security
                    people were not too pleased with that, but it was very effective and popular. If
                    you ever encountered LBJ personally, you could feel his magnetic presence when
                    he shook your hand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were his comments about some of the things he
                        saw?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: He realized immediately that the villages he visited were not what he
                    had asked for; too much white wash, potted plants, and ceremony. He didn't spend
                    much time with that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he make any comments about the program generally?</hi>

                <p>WILLIAMS: Iran was a high priority for the U.S. and his interest was on the
                    political side, commenting favorably on the Shah's white revolution and the
                    importance of building popular support. There was an Iranian election coming up
                    and LBJ's style of reaching out to people was much admired. Iranians spoke of
                    “electioneering LBJ style”. Iranian politicians took to waving to crowds and
                    shaking hands; for awhile it was something of a cult.</p>
                <p>We supported a change of prime ministers and there was a liberalizing influence
                    at that time for the Shah's government, with land distribution, and more
                    emphasis on development through the Plan Organization. And the emphasis on a
                    white revolution had brought aid priorities to the fore.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to the public administration program? Was
                        that continued?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: It was cut back dramatically as a result of our assessment of which
                    programs had taken hold and which hadn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would you say was taking hold? Which ones were making
                        some impact?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Clearly those that were identified with the Shah's white revolution,
                    particularly in public health and education.</p>
                <p>The mission's public safety program also assumed importance since there were
                    security problems in Tehran with sporadic mob demonstrations against the Shah.
                    It was an uneasy political situation. In an earlier period the American aid
                    office in Tehran had been wrecked by mob action. Consequently, contacts between
                    the American public safety division with the Iranian security forces were
                    maintained. There were periodic alerts for American families and school children
                    to stay out of the central city. In one instance a mob was moving on the
                    American school and a force was dispatched to evacuate the children. These were
                    trying times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But there was a ferment evolving in the country which
                        manifested itself later.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: There was a ferment developing in the country. The Shah was not popular
                    despite our efforts with the white revolution, and the political and security
                    situation watenuous. But, serious manifestation of this did not emerge until
                    much later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we providing balance of payments aid or PL 480
                        assistance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: We were providing PL 480 but not balance of payments assistance. Our
                    military assistance was still a factor with the Shah. And a new approach was to
                    engage the Iranian military in development projects. As part of the white
                    revolution, military personnel, mostly young recruits, were sent to villages to
                    teach literacy. The Shah fully backed the literacy campaign, but it is difficult
                    to know its effect. At any rate, it was an effort to popularize the Shah and his
                    army.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there a lot of institutions that you helped create at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: It was a period of consolidation, of turning facilities and programs
                    over to the Iranians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned agricultural colleges?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Yes, there had been important aid contributions to an agricultural
                    college and an agricultural bank, as well as health clinics and hospital
                    facilities. These were initiatives which continued to serve Iran well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any of the institutions that were particularly strong and
                        lasting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: We completed the many projects begun, strengthened some projects
                    institutionally, and progressively integrated them into Iranian institutions.
                    This constituted reasonable progress.</p>
                <p>When you ask about “lasting” institutions, you seek a perspective that extends
                    beyond my time, for I left Iran in 1963. The aid program had equipped schools,
                    clinics and other facilities, but real strength and continuity depended on the
                    quality and numbers of local personnel trained. It is here that we made our most
                    important contribution, particularly in health, agriculture, education and
                    perhaps public administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a sense of communist threat to the country
                        from outside?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: There was said to be a communist party; it never seemed very strong. It
                    seemed to me that the real threat was from the younger people who were educated,
                    nationalist and who found the Shah's form of autocratic government
                    objectionable.</p>
                <p>There was a tendency to continue to see communism as a threat in Iran. Under the
                    earlier containment policy, Iran had been encouraged to join CENTO and U.S.
                    policy had done a lot to link Iran, Pakistan and Turkey militarily. Decisions
                    were still made on political criteria, despite the development emphasis fostered
                    by AID. One example was the CENTO railroad to link Turkey and Iran, a project
                    which the State Department pressed entirely on political grounds despite its
                    poor economic rationale. State officers persuaded Secretary Dean Rusk to
                    override the AID objections and AID funded the CENTO railroad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was built?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: It was built. I don't think it was ever meaningful in economic terms.
                    But it was built on security grounds that I didn't think made much sense.
                    Assistant Administrator Bill Gaud and I unsuccessfully opposed it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you in Iran?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I was in Iran from 1958 to 1960 and from 1961 to 1963. The year in
                    between I was in Washington as NESA program officer during the redirection of
                    the aid program. In 1963, I went to Pakistan.</p>
                <p>In summing up on Iran, I had made a reputation, in part, by recording my
                    opposition to the U.S. policy of placing so much emphasis and resources on the
                    Shah's ambitions for a large military establishment. That became the view of the
                    Kennedy Administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did you say we shouldn't be building up the Shah
                        militarily? What was your reasoning for that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: An awful lot of resources were wasted on a military establishment that
                    didn't have much purpose. Iran had tremendous human and economic potential which
                    could have been realized. The combined economic programs of the Plan
                    Organization and the USAID sponsored program in health, education, agriculture
                    and rural development had tremendous approval from the Iranian people and could
                    have stabilized the country if they had received appropriate support. For a time
                    it looked promising, but the Shah essentially gutted the development effort in
                    favor of continued rearmament and related heavy industry.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>The Shah believed he was divine, “the king of kings, the light of the world”,
                    these were his formal titles. Few people could influence such divinity. The
                    American Ambassador, Julius Holmes, had a sense of what it took to influence the
                    Shah, and to maintain a balanced supporting programs. Unfortunately, later U.S.
                    ambassadors and administrations found it easier to pander to the Shah's military
                    ambitions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was because of Iran bordered on the Soviet
                        Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: No Iranian army was going to withstand a Soviet invasion, which in any
                    case was unlikely. No purpose was served in overemphasizing arms at the expense
                    of development.</p>
                <p>An Iranian I admired was Abol Hassan Ebtehaj, the head of the Plan Organization.
                    Ebtehaj objected strenuously when the Shah reduced the funds available to the
                    Plan Organization in favor of the military establishment. That took courage;
                    Ebtehaj was jailed for his efforts.</p>
                <p>When I first met Eptahaj, he asked about my background. I said I had studied at
                    the University of Chicago and was a development economist. He observed “How
                    fortunate your country was to have developed before there were development
                    economists.” He was not only a man of principle but also of wit and humor.</p>
                <p>Assignment as USAID Mission Director in Pakistan, 1963-1967</p>
                <p>After Iran, I was assigned as deputy and later director of the AID Mission in
                    Pakistan, which was a very different proposition from Iran. The Government of
                    Pakistan had a strong administrative structure which before partition from India
                    had been part of the British-India Civil Service. While employing few in
                    numbers, the British-India service was regarded as the steel frame which held
                    together a diverse and complex subcontinent. Similarly, the Pakistan Civil
                    Service was the steel frame which administered Pakistan. It's officers were few
                    but they manned the senior posts and were highly competent, although below that
                    top level there was limited professionalism.</p>
                <p>Pakistan was governed by an authoritarian regime headed by General Ayub Khan. As
                    president of the country he placed a high priority on economic development,
                    having frozen the military budget and directed increased revenues for
                    development. Pakistan was not only a member of the U.S. sponsored CENTO alliance
                    - having received substantial U.S. armaments - but it clearly met the new aid
                    criteria of the Kennedy Administration: a priority for development, clear goals
                    and domestic mobilization of resources for economic development.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>Again I found myself working in a major aid mission with large technical staffs,
                    both American and local. The reorganized AID integrated a capital loan fund and
                    an enlarged PL 480 Food for Peace program, along with technical assistance, and
                    had authority to commit these resources on a multi-year basis in support of
                    sound development plans and assurance of reforms for effective performance. The
                    Mission was staffed not only with technical advisors, but also with economists,
                    loan officers and legal talent, providing a complete capability to approve and
                    process loans within the AID Mission to Pakistan. There was a large measure of
                    operational autonomy delegated to the field. It was an exciting time for
                    development.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember, it was the real key to AID activity and
                        mission.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: President Ayub Khan's finance minister was Mohammed Shoaib who was
                    dedicated to development. He would later become Senior Vice President of the
                    World Bank. Shoaib, a close confidante of President Ayub Khan, was the guiding
                    spirit at the center of the Pakistan Government's economic programs. A Five Year
                    Plan had been formulated with the assistance of the Harvard Advisory Group,
                    headed by Dave Bell who had become Administrator of AID. The Pakistan Plan was
                    considered a textbook model of development planning.</p>
                <p>We were a favored AID Mission administering a high level of assistance and
                    staffed with some of the best talent AID could muster. U.S. economic assistance
                    to Pakistan in 1964-65 totaled some $400 million annually, including technical
                    assistance, development loans and food aid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any commodity aid in dollars in addition to the
                        PL 480?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: A substantial part of the program was for commodity program assistance.
                    And it was program assistance which provided an important bargaining tool for
                    encouraging and supporting reforms, a process we called “performance
                    bargaining.” The integrated development loan fund provided for both commodity
                    and project assistance. The substantial PL 480 commodity assistance was
                    repayable in local currency which provided flexible budget support for aid
                    financed projects.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have other instruments?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: You used every instrument that could be brought to bear.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>A consortium of aid donors provided total resources approaching $600,000,000 a
                    year. The World Bank was heavily engaged both in pre-investment studies and
                    project financing. A Harvard Advisory Team was integrated into the planning
                    units of the central ministries. The United Nations had a number of sectoral
                    advisors. And the large AID Mission in Karachi, with provincial offices in
                    Lahore and Dacca, encompassed most of the skills necessary to carry out a
                    combined development assistance effort. It was a major responsibility.</p>
                <p>Pakistan was a country in two parts separated by a thousand miles across India —
                    West and East Pakistan. They shared a common religion but were otherwise totally
                    different in culture, ethnic character, climate and geography; in a sense they
                    were two countries and have since become two countries. The varied conditions,
                    East and West, posed quite different development potentials and a unique range
                    of issues and problems. Within a central political and financial frame, there
                    was a good deal of administrative autonomy in each of the provinces and their
                    respective governors were authentic political leaders.</p>
                <p>A principal thrust of the aid program was the building and staffing of
                    institutions of higher learning. The PL 480 counterpart in rupees was jointly
                    programmed for buildings and equipment. The new institutions included teacher
                    training colleges in Karachi and Dacca, agricultural universities in Lyallpur
                    and Mymensingh, an administrative staff college in Lahore and a rural
                    development training center in Peshawar. Each of these were staffed by American
                    university contract teams while the newly recruited Pakistani faculty were being
                    educated in the partner U.S. universities. Additionally, a large participant
                    training program provided courses for hundreds of Pakistanis in the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>Education assistance was among our most important contributions to Pakistan's
                    future. The programs were well conceived and administered. The only real problem
                    was to assure that the selection process for participant training was based on
                    merit rather than favoritism.</p>
                <p>As in Iran, USAID mounted a substantial public administration program. In
                    retrospect, I believe the American aid approach to public administration was
                    overly rigid in assuming that American administrative doctrine and practices
                    were the gospel. The British administrative tradition was more flexible and in
                    some respects may have been better adapted to conditions in Pakistan. American
                    technicians were often less flexible and sensitive than they might have been in
                    adapting American methods to local circumstances. This was true for other
                    technical fields as well. We believed the “know-how” derived from American
                    experience had universal validity, and we were there to instruct these poor
                    countries. That was a weakness of our technical assistance program. At the time
                    I too was imbued with the belief that we knew the answers; our adaptation to
                    cultural differences was not what it should have been.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>Water management and its application to agriculture were major concerns for
                    Pakistan's development. In the political separation between India and Pakistan
                    there was a division of waters of the tributary rivers of the Indus plain.
                    British-India had developed a large integrated system of gravitational
                    irrigation extending for hundreds of miles. Its division meant extensive
                    engineering and investment in several large dams and water channels. This
                    investment was led by the World Bank with the support of a donor consortium,
                    which included USAID.</p>
                <p>There were a number of issues concerning further aid for extension of the
                    irrigation system by an additional major dam at Tarbela, and upgrading of the
                    existing irrigation system which was plagued by water leakage and loss of
                    productive land from water logging and salinity. AID funded a major study in
                    regional water development and management, along with related agricultural land
                    use. This led to a sequence of technical and capital investment projects.
                    Additional to up-grading water channels, we financed large area projects for
                    deep tube wells for control of water availability and for selective reclamation
                    drainage. Tube well development supplemented the gravitational irrigation system
                    and greatly increased the productive land area.</p>
                <p>Water management and investment was also critical to development in East
                    Pakistan. Its low-lying delta was subject to alternate severe flooding and dry
                    seasons, as well as salt water incursions from the Sea of Bengal. Here the USAID
                    program involved measures to alleviate flooding, extensive use of low-lift river
                    pumps to expand agricultural output in the dry season, and the building of
                    “polders” to enclose areas against sea water incursion - much as the Dutch had
                    done in Holland.</p>
                <p>The US AID program also emphasized participation by village farmers to improve
                    agricultural practices, and support village level schools and clinics. The
                    effort was to stimulate local self-help and demand for supporting services,
                    while pressing various public extension services to be more responsive to local
                    needs. The progress in participatory community development - supported by both
                    the Ford Foundation and AID - was notable in East Pakistan and was widely
                    publicized in the international development community.</p>
                <p>The Green Revolution made possible a quantum jump in food grain production,
                    providing farmers could combine the higher yielding seeds (initially wheat and
                    later rice) with appropriate application of water and chemical fertilizer. With
                    the progress in water management, fertilizer supply was the critical constraint
                    for Pakistan in taking advantage of the Green Revolution. Addressing this
                    problem would involve reform of Pakistan's fertilizer distribution policies.</p>
                <p>The Government was not accustomed to investing in fertilizer for production of
                    food grains, and when I proposed to including fertilizer in the U.S. financed
                    commodity loan Finance Minister Shoaib initially refused, saying “Why should we
                    when we can get the grain we need from PL 480 imports?”.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>I replied, “Yes but that's won't last forever, Mr. Minister, and you've got to
                    build your own capability for producing the food you need”. Finally he agreed,
                    “All right, Maury, I know you have a reputation to make in Washington. As a
                    favor to you, we'll include fertilizer imports.”</p>
                <p>Minister Shoaib was not entirely convinced that it was sound economics to
                    substitute dollar repayable fertilizer imports - even on concessionary terms -
                    for local currency repayable wheat. However, the issue was one of applying
                    foreign aid to build self-reliance rather than encouraging over-dependence.
                    Consequently I continued to urge the importance of fertilizer in speeches
                    throughout the country with the slogan that “fertilizer is development.”</p>
                <p>That put the Mission in the fertilizer business, in the sense that we would seek
                    to reform Pakistan's distribution system for agricultural farm supplies. We
                    began financing fertilizer under our commodity import program, but it had to be
                    readily available and reach farmers on time for effective application.
                    Pakistan's distribution system was shot through with inefficiency and
                    favoritism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a government distribution system?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Yes, there was strong opposition to placing the distribution of
                    fertilizer in the private sector, so we worked at improving the government's
                    procurement and distribution practices.</p>
                <p>Reform to improve efficiency in the use of aid and in Pakistan's overall
                    development was an integral part of the AID program. In annual reviews with
                    Pakistan officials we would identify a reform agenda, focusing on issues where
                    improved performance was important to aid effectiveness. We called this process
                    “performance bargaining.” Change was possible but you could not overload the
                    circuit; I had learned early at the Civil Service Commission in Chicago, that
                    “you could make a certain amount of progress but not too much initially.”</p>
                <p>One area of concern was reform of the procedures by which water was administered
                    in Pakistan. Our point of entry was the substantial aid we were providing for
                    water management projects, particularly in tube well development in West
                    Pakistan and river pumps and water control embankments in East Pakistan. This
                    meant negotiating with the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) in each
                    of the provinces. While Pakistan's senior civil servants were competent, and
                    some quite talented, the middle levels of their administration were often overly
                    rigid and slow to change what were cumbersome bureaucratic systems. The need was
                    for much more effective implementation of development projects, particularly
                    where major capital investments were involved. Often broad economic policy
                    issues were involved. For example, AID financing of a thermo-electric power
                    plant in Karachi and a project for exploitation of natural gas raised the
                    question of energy pricing and the extent of public subsidy.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>We were bargaining for improved performance at every step of the way. However,
                    reform of major economic policies involves negotiation on the level and
                    composition of program commodity assistance which provided the best opening.
                    AIDs experience with performance bargaining for policy reform in the 1960s,
                    particularly in Pakistan and India, would later become the model for World Bank
                    “policy based lending” in the 1980s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you elaborate a little bit on performance bargaining
                        and what it consisted of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: The AID doctrine of the 1960s was that large-scale aid would relieve
                    the constraint of capital investment — with food aid as an essential wage good —
                    and yield accelerated economic growth. If the “take off” for growth and
                    investment was to be sustained, however, it was essential that there be an
                    accompanying internal mobilization effort and, most important, that the large
                    aid not substitute for or be a disincentive to a recipient country's internal
                    efforts. This was the rationale for performance bargaining.</p>
                <p>Relating economic assistance levels to performance involved important questions
                    of timing in relation to the balance between incentives and disincentives.
                    Logically, the time to reach understanding over reform policies was before major
                    commitments of economic assistance. There was an alternate view, favored by the
                    AID Mission in India, that high levels of aid provided an essential early
                    incentive to change traditional attitudes, which in turn would lead to policy
                    reforms for accelerated economic growth.</p>
                <p>My view was that performance bargaining had to be on the agenda of the country
                    aid mission before and during provision of high aid levels. And there was a
                    critical future timing issue when it would be important to begin cutting back
                    the aid level relative to internal resource efforts and incentives.
                    Understandably, there was a great deal of imprecision in the application of
                    performance bargaining, depending on country circumstances and the context of
                    U.S. foreign policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this involve a lot of conditionality and covenants and
                        all of those types of things that we talked about as it related to aid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: For capital loan projects it was usual to apply conditions precedent.
                    However, we did not think in terms of conditionality as proposals to be imposed.
                    Rather, we sought to build specific understanding for reforms by back-up studies
                    and intensive discussions with Pakistan officials and the Harvard Advisory team.
                    It was an in-country review process by people who knew Pakistan on the ground
                    and who sought workable solutions; that was the comparative advantage of AID in
                    the 1960s over later conditionality applied by Washington-based donor
                    agencies.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a lot of resistance on the government's part or
                        were they more or less party to it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: There was often resistance to change in the middle level of the
                    bureaucracy. They were used to doing things in a very administratively
                    controlled way, and change could be threatening to the sense of bureaucratic
                    stability. It could also threaten patronage and the corruption involved in
                    administrative controls. Implementation was often tough going. Progress was
                    possible with the support of senior leadership; and we had the resources to help
                    reduce the risks of reforms.</p>
                <p>One of the most notable reforms we achieved in cooperation with the government
                    was to liberalize the import regime. It was government controlled through import
                    licenses and there was a lot of inefficiency and corruption in it. Import
                    licenses were worth money and they were often traded as political favors.</p>
                <p>In negotiations AID agreed to provide substantial additional program commodity
                    import assistance as imports were shifted to an import license auction system
                    and domestic agricultural price controls were lifted. PL 480 food imports would
                    stabilize prices for consumers even as farmers gained incentives for increased
                    production. And Pakistan was able to expand imports of essential raw materials
                    in a market allocation system through auction of available foreign exchange.
                    This not only reduced corruption but provided essential raw materials to the
                    private sector. We provided several hundred million dollars of program loan
                    support for that purpose.</p>
                <p>It was a fairly significant reform, and we got a lot of credit in Washington from
                    the development and academic communities. I mention the academic community
                    because AID at that time drew heavily on the professional advice of
                    academicians. I was called to Washington periodically for a review of the aid
                    program to Pakistan, and Dave Bell as AID Administrator would be flanked by
                    professors like Ed Mason, Gus Ranis and Hollis Chenery as principal advisors.
                    Chenery at the time was at Harvard University, and would later become an AID
                    Assistant Administrator for Policy and Program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some of the greats of the development era.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Some of the greats who had made real contribution to development. And
                    they were impressed with our progress in liberalizing the import regime as a
                    support for private sector development. A freer import system favored industrial
                    entrepreneurs who were emerging from the merchant class. We even did some
                    initial planning for a stock market to help mobilize private capital.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much of a private sector then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: There were a number of wealthy families in Pakistan and a manufacturing
                    sector developed initially in the processing of agricultural products, including
                    cotton and jute textiles, as well as import substitution of consumer goods. An
                    entrepreneurial class of talented merchants had migrated from Bombay and there
                    was investment in many small machine and metal working shops as well as
                    commercial ventures in banking and construction in the major cities.
                    Manufacturing from an initial low level base was increasing at the rate of 15-20
                    per cent annually. A major constraint was raw material imports. So there was the
                    potential for a vigorous private sector which needed encouragement and support.
                    And commercial interests in private sector development had a major advocate in
                    Minister of Finance Shoaib.</p>
                <p>Another interesting development was a dam at Tarbela which would provide
                    additional control and capacity for the water of Indus River. It was important
                    for the agricultural development of West Pakistan, a big project requiring at
                    least a billion dollars for its construction. The Pakistan Government had lined
                    up World Bank support and the interest of a number of other donors, but needed
                    to secure commitment of an additional $40 million. Completing the funding for
                    Tarbela was a priority to which President Ayub Khan frequently referred. AID did
                    not have that amount available. We had made major commitments for tube wells and
                    low lift pumps, several capital projects for energy development, as well as
                    large program assistance for the market-oriented import program.</p>
                <p>While on consultation in Washington, I accompanied Assistant Administrator Bill
                    Gaud to see if we could persuade Harold Linder, President of the EX-IM Bank, to
                    provide the capping funds for the Tarbela Dam. With American assistance assured,
                    all the other donor funding would come forward and the billion dollar Tarbela
                    project could go forward. I had known Linder from my early assignment in the
                    Economic Bureau at State when I attended his staff meetings. Linder agreed to
                    bend the EX-IM Bank's funding criteria in favor of moving the large Tarbela
                    project. That was an achievement.</p>
                <p>In 1963 the Pakistan Mission in Pakistan received an outstanding performance
                    award from AID. It was an award to the entire Mission from Dave Bell as
                    Administrator, and one that pleased us immensely.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>In the ensuing period, there were increasing tensions between Pakistan and India,
                    tensions which greatly complicated U.S. policy in the region. Pakistan as a
                    member of CENTO had received substantial military assistance from the United
                    States. India as a non-aligned country had received arms from the Soviet Union.
                    President Kennedy's Administration had shifted aid policy from military security
                    to large-scale economic development assistance for both India and Pakistan. Now,
                    however, the Soviet Union was stepping-up the level of its aid to India in both
                    armaments and industrial plants, and the U.S. was increasingly sympathetic to
                    shaping the aid program to India as a counter to Soviet influence, both in terms
                    of industrial plants and even selective military assistance.</p>
                <p>In the view of the Pakistan Government these developments threatened to upset the
                    military balance in the subcontinent. Pakistan sought U.S. aid for advanced
                    armaments and a steel plant to match what the Soviet were providing India;
                    however the Kennedy Administration was not prepared to meet these requests.
                    Underlying the increasing tensions in the subcontinent was the unresolved
                    Kashmir dispute between Pakistan and India.</p>
                <p>After my first year with the Mission in Pakistan, I took “rest and recuperation
                    leave” (R&amp;R) in Kashmir, rather than in Hong Kong or Beirut which was normal
                    Mission practice. However, I insisted on combining a splendid family holiday
                    with familiarization of Kashmir and Nepal. We traveled in Kashmir, rented a
                    house boat in Srinagar, did some pony trekking, and gained some impressions of
                    the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the issues at that time? What
                        was your sense of the difficulty?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Kashmir is a beautiful area with rich potential, in terms of tourism
                    and the craft skills of its people. It has the reputation of the fairest women
                    of the subcontinent. One farmer said to me, “Our land is fertile, we have water,
                    and our women are fair; yet we are poor.” Their potential in land and water was
                    underdeveloped. My political assessment of the Kashmiris was that while Moslem,
                    they were not as militant about being part of Pakistan as were Pakistan's ruling
                    groups - for whom the issue was emotionally non-negotiable.</p>
                <p>During 1964 tensions increased in West Pakistan over the perceived shifting
                    military balance in favor of India, with spillover effects on U.S.-Pakistan
                    relations. Under the lead of the new Foreign Minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the
                    Pakistan Government pursued close relations with Communist China in a
                    non-aggression pact which, in the view of President Lyndon Johnson, undermined
                    Pakistan's obligations to the U.S. under CENTO and SEATO.</p>
                <p>In this period Minister Bhutto gained influence over President Ayub Khan, and
                    Bhutto promoted a pro-China policy. Bhutto was like a son to Ayub Khan, the son
                    Ayub Khan wished he had fathered, it was said.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>While the U.S. Government accepted India's non-alignment in the Cold War, it
                    found the new posture of non-alignment by Pakistan totally unacceptable.
                    President Johnson found particularly irritating Pakistan's criticism of U.S.
                    military engagement in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>In early 1965 U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan, Walter McConaughy, was instructed to
                    convey this message to President Ayub Khan. In order to underline the
                    seriousness with which the U.S. viewed the matter, our Ambassador was further
                    instructed to inform President Ayub that pending satisfactory assurances, the
                    U.S. was suspending its economic assistance to Pakistan and postponing that
                    year's scheduled meeting of the World Bank led-donor consortium for
                    Pakistan.</p>
                <p>Ambassador McConaughy conveyed the content of this instruction from Washington at
                    a hastily called meeting of his country team. As director of the USAID Mission,
                    at that time, it was a shocking proposal and I argued strongly against delivery
                    of the message without first appealing to Washington for reconsideration. Far
                    from achieving the objective of influencing the Government of Pakistan to our
                    way of thinking about China, I argued that such an ultimatum risked having the
                    opposite effect. The successful American aid program constituted important
                    leverage in support of our foreign policy objectives but the best way to use it,
                    I maintained, was by nuance conditionality and further joint discussion with
                    President Ayub to reach a mutual understanding. I proposed that the Ambassador
                    request reconsideration of the instruction and offer to go to Washington to
                    review how best to proceed.</p>
                <p>Deliberation by the Ambassador with his country team advisors was lengthy. In the
                    end he decided to deliver the message as instructed forthwith.</p>
                <p>I was deeply disappointed not to make the case for reconsideration; in my view it
                    was politically the wrong thing to do. We were dealing with people of great
                    national pride, and I was sure that applying a blunt instrument which said:
                    “Either you do it our way or we'll suspend aid” was going to adversely affect
                    our ability to influence them. In my view, we in the field had a responsibility
                    to at least point that out.</p>
                <p>Walter McConaughy was an experienced diplomat. As a young foreign service
                    officer, he had served in China with distinction. He had escaped the earlier
                    McCarthy “witch hunt,” and there weren't many old “China hands” in the State
                    Department that had done so. Also, the ambassador may have known things that I
                    didn't know. So my advice was overridden.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was essentially because of Pakistan's alignment with
                        China.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Yes, Pakistan's military leaders believed that their security was
                    gravely imperiled by the military build-up in India and viewed closer relation
                    with China as an imperative. American policy at that time was to isolate China.
                    Later, we would find it useful that Pakistan had normalized relations with
                    China. The opening to China by the Nixon administration was with Pakistan's good
                    offices. This was not that time and the China lobby in Washington was deeply
                    offended by Pakistan's closer alignment with China. From the Pakistan
                    perspective it was an attempt to maintain a regional balance with India.</p>
                <p>After the Ambassador delivered the message, U.S. relations with the Pakistanis
                    deteriorated sharply, to say the least. And our program of aid cooperation was
                    at a standstill, although we sought to maintain our Pakistani contacts. Q: You
                    were not able to continue anything. Everything came to a halt?</p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Technically, it was only new USAID commitments that were suspended. We
                    did postpone the donor consortium meeting so most other new aid sources were
                    held in abeyance. But, we didn't pull out and we didn't stop assistance
                    activities already underway.However, the USAID Mission found it difficult to
                    continue implementing the aid program in an atmosphere that was increasingly
                    adverse, even hostile.</p>
                <p>The Pakistan Government mounted a political campaign against the United States
                    for using economic assistance as a political weapon, and Pakistan increasingly
                    took the posture of a non-aligned country internationally. The press played on
                    sensitive national feelings of offense that we would suspend economic assistance
                    when Pakistan met all of the development criteria in terms of effective use of
                    aid.</p>
                <p>There was a real deterioration in the environment in which we were trying to
                    work. Minister Bhutto's influence in the government was increasingly strong; he
                    was a talented politician and apparent leader of an anti-American faction. Our
                    friends in the government were progressively isolated and all their meetings
                    with Americans, on AID business or otherwise, were monitored by specially
                    designated note takers who reported to a security service.</p>
                <p>Finance Minister Shoaib was trying to keep things on a moderate keel, but he also
                    lost influence. When I called on Shoaib, which I did regularly, we would have to
                    walk in the garden away from his office to have a private conversation free from
                    wire taps and note takers. His reports to me on the high anti-American
                    orientation of government policy were progressively disturbing.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>Illustrative of the surveillance, I recall a phone conversation from my residence
                    in Karachi which was badly interrupted by static. While on the line I said, “I
                    wish you people would be more efficient in tapping this phone. You're doing a
                    bad job and messing up the line.” A week later, there was a Pakistani at my gate
                    outside the house who wished to speak to me. He said,” Please, Mr. Williams,
                    don't complain about the way we wiretap your phones. I have a wife and children,
                    and I don't want to lose my job.”</p>
                <p>Trying to discuss questions of development policy and aid performance under these
                    circumstances was impossible and effectively the mission program came to a halt.
                    Even keeping contact with our opposite numbers in the government was difficult,
                    anti-American feeling was running high. Finally, I concluded that I needed a
                    break to get away from the continuous frustration in official relations. I
                    decided to take my family for another holiday in Kashmir.</p>
                <p>Tensions were high between Pakistan and India, and we had to walk carrying our
                    luggage across a closed border between Lahore and Amritsar. There I found that
                    Air India had canceled flights to Kashmir so we proceeded to Kashmir in a hired
                    taxi. En route northward we moved through convoys of a motorized Indian army
                    division. The Indian troops were helpful, waving us through and even bodily
                    carrying the small Indian taxi over an near impassable rock slide. Later in
                    mountainous Gulmarg, a former British resort, I saw Indian troops take up
                    defensive positions. Srinagar was strangely devoid of tourists and alive with
                    rumors of impending hostilities, and while we were there, Pakistan troops
                    disguised as Kashmiri guerrillas infiltrated to foment an uprising. But the
                    Kashmiris did not respond, there was no uprising.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the Pakistani Government assumed that they would?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: They assumed they would, but as I had observed in an earlier trip to
                    Kashmir, the Kashmiris were not a militant or warrior people. After my return to
                    Pakistan, the 1965 Indo-Pak war broke out and it was clear that Pakistan had
                    miscalculated. Not only had the infiltration of Kashmir failed, but Indian armed
                    forces were in a full-scale attack on Lahore. The Pakistan miscalculation was
                    due to an earlier border clash in the south when an Indian army division broke
                    in disorderly retreat, leading the Pakistan military to assume a seven to one
                    dominance in fighting valor over Indian troops which was wrong.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Ambassador McConaughy asked me to join him in Rawalpindi for calls on
                    senior government officials. President Ayub Kahn and much of his government were
                    in Rawalpindi, although the new capital of Islamabad had not yet been built. The
                    U.S. Embassy, AID Mission and our families were still in Karachi.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>During the night the Indian air force attacked Rawalpindi and I woke up thinking
                    “The Germans are at it again.” In my subconscious I was back in one of the
                    bombing raids on London during the Second World War. But I soon realized that
                    this was an Indian attack on the near-by radio station in Rawalpindi. Outside my
                    window was a 500 lb. bomb dropped by the Indian air force which had not
                    exploded. With the air war activity, the Ambassador and I were isolated from our
                    respective staffs 700 miles to the south in Karachi. All non-military flights
                    were suspended.</p>
                <p>But there was a U.S. communication unit in Rawalpindi and I became the
                    ambassador's chief assistant in efforts to gain a negotiated cease fire. For
                    several days we worked around the clock with “flash” communications to
                    Washington, London, New York, New Delhi. Flash designations meant of high
                    national security concern. Accompanying the Ambassador in the several calls on
                    President Ayub Khan, I observed that the black circles around Ayub's eyes were
                    larger and larger. He wasn't getting much sleep in that tense situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was in Rawalpindi at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Yes, Rawalpindi was Pakistan's military headquarters.</p>
                <p>A cease fire was in Pakistan's interest for although General Yahya Khan had won a
                    major tank battle on the road to Kashmir, Pakistan's defense of Lahore was
                    failing. The difficulty that Ayub Khan perceived in accepting a cease fire was
                    that it would appear traitorous since the Pakistan people had been assured they
                    were winning Kashmir. He expressed fear of a civil uprising.</p>
                <p>The military situation forced Ayub Khan finally to accept a cease fire brokered
                    at the U.N. Security Council in New York. An insight into the degree of
                    isolation of President Ayub Khan was the incident of the barber shop. Not having
                    slept for two nights I went to a barber shop for a shave, and there heard
                    President Ayub Khan's radio announcement of the cease fire. There was a group of
                    almost 50 Pakistan civilians gathered around that radio; they heard the
                    announcement quietly and without comment. Fear of an internal uprising didn't
                    seem realistic from the way this group took the news.</p>
                <p>Ambassador McConaughy found my report interesting enough to suggest, “I want you
                    to tell the President what you heard in the barber shop.” Getting the Ayub Khan
                    on the phone, Walter McConaughy said “Mr. President, I want you to speak to
                    Maury Williams. He heard your announcement in the barbershop with an assembled
                    group of Pakistani people. You will find his report quite interesting.” I
                    related my report to Ayub Khan who seemed pleased. While we were talking, an
                    operator broke in to say that President Johnson wished to speak to President
                    Ayub Khan. President Johnson's call was to commend Ayub on the cease-fire and to
                    assure him of American friendship and support.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>I don't think the AID Mission ever fully gained the momentum that it had before
                    the suspension of aid and the 1965 war. We gradually began to piece the program
                    back together, but it wasn't the same.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the program restarted at some point? Was it while you
                        were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: For both Pakistan and India a year of new development assistance
                    commitments were lost after the war. Support for high levels of aid for Pakistan
                    and India were considerably more difficult to sustain with the U.S. Congress.
                    Also dedication to development had eroded with the top political leadership in
                    Pakistan. President Ayub was retired in favor of General Yahya Khan, and no
                    longer were we assured that the military budget would be restrained in favor of
                    development. It was tougher going all around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So both the move towards China and the infiltration of
                        Kashmir sort of overrode the development priority, upset it, and the support
                        for it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: That is true. I wish Ambassador McConaughy had appealed the aid
                    suspension and encouraged a reassessment in Washington. Because the suspension
                    played into the hands of the national extremists in Pakistan who convinced
                    themselves and the leadership that they had nothing to lose from the U.S. in a
                    military gamble with India over Kashmir. And Pakistan's opening of relations
                    with China was mostly symbolic in power terms. It was a time for restraint in
                    U.S. relations with Pakistan, as the U.S. found itself competing with Soviet
                    influence in India. Balancing our relations with these two countries was always
                    sensitive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you characterize what was accomplished in that
                        period in a sense of what was left or sustained after the '65 war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: The accomplishments were very real. Agricultural production had
                    increased substantially in response to investment in water development - the aid
                    financed tube wells in West Pakistan and low lift pumps in East Pakistan - along
                    with improved fertilizer availability and high yield seed varieties, along with
                    better prices for farm crops. The green revolution was real in Pakistan.</p>
                <p>In cooperation with the Pakistanis, we continued to do a tremendous job in
                    training people, in building educational institutions and helping to staff these
                    institutions with Pakistanis trained in American universities.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>As the government moved to Islamabad, I decided to move the central AID Mission
                    office from Karachi to Lahore. In Islamabad, facilities were very limited. Also,
                    I believed Islamabad was too isolated, entirely government officials, whereas in
                    Lahore you could keep in touch with a broader range of public opinion, business
                    interests, provincial leaders and there was less political tension. Normal
                    relations could be pursued more readily at the provincial level.</p>
                <p>In the period after the 1965 war, I focused more attention on development in East
                    Pakistan. They had been largely unaffected by the political rivalries and
                    fighting over Kashmir and their interest in working with us was undiminished. We
                    had a large provincial office in Dacca and I spent more time there attempting to
                    make up, in part, for the relative neglect of East Pakistan in the internal
                    budgetary allocations of the central government.</p>
                <p>East Pakistan is a very difficult development proposition, a greatly
                    overpopulated rural economy with extreme poverty. The AID program focused on
                    agriculture and community rural development, encouraging a generally
                    participatory approach. The Mission made a film of the participatory approach,
                    called “A Simple Cup of Tea.” The film demonstrated villagers discussing their
                    needs and how they planned to meet them over a cup of tea.</p>
                <p>At the same time, we encouraged the extension agents of the various provincial
                    offices to engage more actively in support of village level projects. This was
                    an early application of participatory development, which would later become
                    doctrine in the development assistance community.</p>
                <p>Although East Pakistan's foreign exchange earnings were fairly high from export
                    of jute, most of it was allocated to West Pakistan. I attempted to reform that.
                    However, the AID Mission's influence proved to be limited, particularly on that
                    issue. Also, as I mentioned, the constraints on the military budget no longer
                    applied after the 1965 war. Since that constraint had been at least a partial
                    basis of our earlier large aid program, the level of AID assistance declined.
                    And other donors were not quite as enthusiastic in their support of Pakistan's
                    development.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you sense, at that time, the beginnings of East
                        Pakistan separating from the West?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: No I did not. In Dacca I was dealing with senior officials, development
                    planners trying to induce a greater priority for development. It was a weaker
                    administration than in West Pakistan, and part of the problem for East Pakistan
                    was that their programs weren't as well developed. But it seemed to be part of
                    the excuse of the central Pakistan administration for their relative neglect in
                    meeting development needs in the East. Our AID efforts were to develop the
                    programs that would allow them to have a better claim on development
                    resources.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>I completed the move of the AID Mission to Lahore. Since the AID Mission had
                    access to large counterpart funds in rupees, it was well able to command the
                    facilities needed. Lahore is a beautiful city with an active community life and
                    commercial economy. My family was pleased with Lahore, although I spent a lot of
                    time traveling to Islamabad to maintain contact with the central government
                    ministries.</p>
                <p>Appointment by President Johnson as Assistant Administrator for Near East and
                    South Asia-(NESA) 1967 - 1970</p>
                <p>Soon after the move to Lahore, I got a telegram from the President Johnson which
                    said. “I propose to nominate you to the Senate as Assistant Administrator for
                    the Near East and South Asia. Indicate your concurrence.” That was a big
                    surprise.</p>
                <p>In March 1967 I was sworn into that position, and ten days later I appeared
                    before House Committee on Foreign Affairs in defense of the Fiscal Year 1968
                    Program request for some $800 million for the NESA region. It was a difficult
                    period for AID. Of course defending foreign assistance was always difficult, but
                    I recall Bill Gaud, then AID Administrator, telling me that 1967 was the lowest
                    level of U.S. foreign assistance appropriated up to that time. The assistance
                    program launched by President Kennedy to support an all-out effort in economic
                    development, by recipient countries and by the donors associated with us, was
                    faltering. The spirit of the times had changed away from a strong focus on
                    development to more security concerns.</p>
                <p>The situation in Vietnam contributed to that change as foreign assistance was
                    increasingly redirected to the war in Vietnam. As a result previously strong
                    American support for foreign aid steadily eroded. AID made strenuous efforts to
                    sustain the development focus of its programs. We soldiered on with the program,
                    by that I mean we defended it as well as we could with the public — in speeches
                    to business groups and with the Congress. We attempted to stay the course. But
                    it was increasingly a rear guard action as public support receded and the
                    program sustained sharp cuts by the Congress.</p>
                <p>It is interesting to recall that the development focus of President Kennedy's
                    economic assistance program, with its emphasis on policy reform and performance
                    by developing countries, would return 20 years later, in the early 1980s, under
                    the leadership of the World Bank.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why? What do you mean by that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: In the 1980s there would be a return to the earlier emphasis on the
                    policy framework, on structural adjustment and the reforms needed for more
                    effective use of resources, as well as associating donors in the application of
                    program assistance to achieve agreed objectives. These were the things we were
                    doing in the AID program of the 1960s, and which the World Bank turned to in the
                    1980s. Ernie Stern, who was program officer in India during the Kennedy
                    administration, had become Senior Vice President of the World Bank in the 1980s.
                    He introduced these policy concepts and they became the hallmark of the Bank
                    program in the '80s.</p>
                <p>From the standpoint of my new responsibilities as NESA Administrator, India,
                    Pakistan and Turkey were among the seven most important AID programs. Others
                    were the major Alliance for Progress countries — Brazil, Chile, Colombia — and
                    in East Asia, South Korea.</p>
                <p>American aid had laid the foundation for more accelerated development in these
                    countries and the task now was to realize the benefits of these efforts. And the
                    Green Revolution was just coming to fruition. The application of new seed
                    varieties combined with appropriate use of fertilizer and water provided a
                    substantial boost to agricultural production and development generally.</p>
                <p>India, with half the population of the non-Communist developing world, was the
                    centerpiece of the new AID approach. Some said that the development assistance
                    policy of the Kennedy Administration had been fashioned by Max Millikan, Walt
                    Rostow and Chester Bowles primarily with India in view. India's development was
                    believed to be of strategic importance to the United States in the competition
                    with Chinese communism. As the two large countries of Asia with competing
                    economic systems — communist China and democratic India with a more free market
                    — there was a sense that the future orientation of Asia depended on the outcome
                    of this competition. And a large number of other donors shared this assessment
                    of India's importance.</p>
                <p>So India was the centerpiece of my attention as Assistant Administrator. Also
                    there was concern that the Indian economy was faltering badly after two
                    successive years of monsoon failure and drought. That affected the whole
                    economy, not only in agricultural production but loss of hydro-generated power
                    on which industry depended. The prospect for revival of India's economy was
                    good, however, especially with the prospect of good rains and the Green
                    Revolution potential. What was needed additionally was to maintain a high level
                    of development assistance.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>However, India was a difficult case politically in the United States. Its history
                    of non-alignment in the Cold War and British-type Fabian socialism caused an
                    ideological divide, politically, between American conservatives and liberals. As
                    a non-aligned country India had not met the security criteria of the
                    Eisenhower/Dulles administration. And India had received large scale military
                    assistance from the Soviet Union while maintaining an independent non-aligned
                    status. Consequently, many American conservatives didn't feel any affinity for
                    India; nor could they understand the administration's position.</p>
                <p>In the Congressional hearing that fall the appropriations process zeroed in on
                    aid to India. As Assistant Administrator I faced continuous questioning day
                    after day over several weeks, on details of the India program. It was a
                    particularly tough process because Otto Passman, the chairman of the
                    Appropriations Subcommittee, clearly disliked India. I was prepared to make a
                    substantive case; we had a good program and the prospects were favorable.
                    However, if I appeared to build a record in favor of aid, Passman would take me
                    “off record”, charging that all these things had been said before and had never
                    happened. For every point I made, he would counter with three against aid. And
                    so it went. Nothing in my background had prepared me for such an unfair
                    confrontational process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Passman was a great one for challenging you on a lot of
                        minutiae, how many vehicles., etc..</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: He would go off the record and say to me “You know those Indian
                    bastards are never going to amount to anything.” Then back on record, Now Mr.
                    Williams...”. I began to get more and more frustrated and tense. At one point
                    Congressman Reigle of Michigan, who later became senator, passed me a note which
                    said, “Keep calm, keep smiling, keep talking, you're doing all right.” I never
                    forgot that bit of sound advice in this baptism of fire that I encountered in
                    congressional hearings. The stakes were fairly high for at that time the
                    subcommittee determined the appropriation level. As Bill Gaud said to me
                    privately, “Passman is a real S.O.B. but he has tremendous power over aid
                    appropriations.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Passman in the end damage the program for India? Did
                        he have any real effect on the program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: In the end he didn't. He made a record for his constituency that aid to
                    India was not good, but all the other programs were given a pass. He didn't even
                    bother with hearings on Latin America and the other regions went sailing through
                    with very perfunctory hearings. It might have been the result of a personal call
                    to Passman from the President, but the India appropriation passed without
                    damage. The outcome may have been influenced by the strategic emphasis of the
                    administration on India as a stake in the competition with communism.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>However, defense of aid to India over the next few years remained a difficult
                    case to make to the U.S. Congress. At that time Gunnar Myrdal came out with a
                    book on development which characterized India as among the “soft states”, states
                    that would never get it all together because they weren't efficient. Quotes to
                    that effect dogged my presentations to the House Foreign Affairs Committee. And
                    increasingly the Congressional focus shifted to the population issue.</p>
                <p>Admittedly, if population growth couldn't be moderated, then development
                    prospects would be dimmed. This point was repeatedly brought to the attention of
                    the Congress by private groups, and India was in the forefront of their
                    concerns. I had continually to answer to the Congress, “What are we doing about
                    population? What are the Indians doing about population?” It was a critical
                    point in my defense of the India aid program.</p>
                <p>I made a number of visits to our field missions, I remember Ambassador Bowles
                    saying, “Here comes Mr. Population again. He's going to lecture us on the
                    population issue.” Ambassador Bowles also was concerned that it had become such
                    a major factor in Congressional support for India. The South Asia office of the
                    World Bank, led by Peter Cargill, was very supportive. His family had been
                    Indian civil servants for four generations and he knew India well. The Swedes
                    were also interested, and I was able to encourage a donor consortium meeting in
                    Stockholm on India's population program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it led by the World Bank or who?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Donor consortium meetings are normally chaired by the World Bank. I
                    convinced the Bank to hold a consortium meeting solely on population. And to
                    demonstrate that we were serious, I pledged $20 million from the U.S. for
                    various population activities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the reaction of the Indians to all this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: They came to Stockholm under protest. They were not pleased with this
                    emphasis. I.G. Patel, who was finance secretary, and was handling their
                    relations with the donors and the consortium felt this was undue external
                    pressure. However, the Indians began to take population more seriously in their
                    planning and the sterilization program went forward much more dramatically. I
                    was able to satisfy the U.S. Congress of this. India was taking a good deal of
                    my time as a de facto country officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before you leave India, what was the program trying to do
                        in terms of development? You mentioned the population, but what about other
                        dimensions?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: The droughts highlighted the need to improve agricultural production
                    and distribution, and the Indian Government dramatically shifted its priorities
                    to achieve self-sufficiency in food grains. This meant increased investment,
                    both public and private, and massive application of fertilizer and improved
                    seeds. Private capital for fertilizer production was encouraged and fertilizer
                    imports were substantially expanded.</p>
                <p>Also India, with donor encouragement, devalued its currency and liberalized
                    import controls to allow increased imports of raw materials and spare parts
                    needed to stimulate domestic production. These reforms — which paralleled our
                    earlier experience with import liberalization in Pakistan — provided a sound
                    basis for stepping up the level of commodity assistance. This was the major
                    feature of the AID program in India. When the policy framework was right, you
                    could pour in aid resources for commodity imports to increase substantially
                    production in industry, fertilizer and for agriculture generally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you think that the policy framework was a good
                        one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: We believed that with reform of the currency and import regime, and
                    greater priority on agriculture and population planning, that the Indian
                    Government was on the right track. They needed to improve their effectiveness in
                    carrying out these program objectives, along with the external resources to move
                    forward. We had a very strong AID Mission there. John Lewis was the mission
                    director and cooperation with the Indian agencies was unusually good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were providing a lot of PL 480 assistance at that time
                        were we not? Helping to feed the population?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Tremendous. We viewed food assistance as essentially a “wage good”
                    since increased development investment, and the increased wages that went with
                    it, were mostly spent on food - which was an indication of the level of
                    undernutrition in India. Our food aid made it possible to step up the level of
                    investment in development projects, which in turn created new jobs and rising
                    wages. The demand for food rose more rapidly than domestic food production and
                    it was PL 480 imports which helped to meet that demand while avoid rising prices
                    for food — thereby facilitating an accelerated pace of non-inflationary
                    development.</p>
                <p>In addition to that rationale for increased food aid, the drought resulted in a
                    tremendous need for emergency food assistance from all donors. The U.S. in a two
                    year period provided ten million tons of PL 480 food supplies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this used as part of the conditionality, the leverage
                        on policy of the PL 480 program?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: AID policy was to parallel increased PL 480 assistance with priority by
                    recipient countries on improved agricultural production. It was, as I explained
                    earlier, part of what we called performance bargaining - based on general under
                    standings rather than formal conditionality.</p>
                <p>A strong element of conditionality was introduced into the PL 480 program to
                    India by President Johnson. LBJ had a very strong feeling about the Indians,
                    because they were so critically independent. They were critics of our Vietnam
                    policy and this infuriated President Johnson. He began to use the leverage of PL
                    480 to try to influence their behavior. It certainly was conditionality, not
                    within the context of our economic program, but in relation to political
                    concerns about Vietnam. However, the President's policy had a useful economic
                    effect because it made India really determined to achieve food self
                    sufficiency.</p>
                <p>But LBJ was determined to make India less critical of U.S. policy. As he put it
                    in his good Texan style, “You sup at our table, you mind your manners.” What he
                    meant was you don't criticize our Vietnam policy. So India was a difficult case,
                    not only in the ideological political divide in the U.S. Congress, but also
                    within the administration.</p>

                        PL 480 program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: President Johnson would delay PL 480 shipments and release individual
                    shipment very slowly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In those days PL 480 programs were approved at the White

                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Both the programs and actual shipments of PL 480 to India were approved
                    personally by the President. He intended for them to mind their manners.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: It had a tremendous influence in encouraging India to place the highest
                    possible priority on raising agricultural production and achieving food grain
                    self-sufficiency. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was very determined about that.
                    The Indians were infuriated to be placed in the position of holding out a beggar
                    bowl for American food aid and its implication for loss of a measure of their
                    independence.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I recall Indira Gandhi as having said, “Never again will I
                        be dependent on external food assistance from the U.S.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: You have to credit Indira Gandhi with giving food self-sufficiency for
                    India a consistently high priority and backing it up with the necessary policy
                    adjustments and resources. It was the Green Revolution of high yielding seed
                    varieties and American technical assistance which provided the necessary
                    foundation. USAID assisted in building four agricultural universities in India
                    and training the perquisite faculties to underpin adaptive agricultural research
                    and extension service. But it was Indira Gandhi's political determination that
                    made relative food self-sufficiency possible. The result was that India no
                    longer had to import food grain and was free of dependence on U.S. PL 480
                    assistance, although the nutrition of a large part of the Indian population
                    never really reached an adequate level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Weren't there projections at that time that given the
                        population growth, India would never be able to feed itself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Yes, population growth was out-pacing food production, a point often
                    stressed during Congressional testimony. It was the high-yield productivity
                    increases of the Green Revolution which made the difference. India had the
                    resource base in soil and water resources, particularly in the bread basket area
                    of the Punjab plain. And they had extensive irrigation facilities begun by the
                    British. Proper management of these resources, plus extensive use of chemical
                    fertilizer, made it possible to gain major increases in agricultural production.
                    Indira Gandhi also placed a high priority on family planning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Another issue I understand was distribution. Were they
                        able to get the food around the country? Was that something we were helping
                        with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Distribution was a tremendous problem, particularly for the import of
                    millions of tons of emergency food aid and moving it from ports to areas of
                    greatest need during the drought. Indian port facilities couldn't handle it, nor
                    was the internal transport adequate to move such large tonnages. We encountered
                    a similar problem in providing food relief for drought afflicted countries in
                    Africa - port facilities and internal transport were the main constraint.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>The distribution problem in India was related to the food security system under
                    British rule when the largely subsistence rural economy of each province was
                    expected to be self contained in food supply, and distribution among regions was
                    restricted. They were not set up to move large quantities of food from one
                    region to another. China had a similar system of expecting individual regions to
                    be largely self-sufficient in food. That way food price inflation could be
                    contained, but it resulted in famine for the provinces affected. With
                    agricultural development and improved transport facilities it has been possible
                    to abolish famine. That was the objective of American aid to India; we did a lot
                    of work on improving food distribution, and particularly on expanding port
                    capacity.</p>
                <p>Although India, with our assistance, made outstanding progress in dealing with
                    food production and distribution, President Johnson still deeply resented their
                    continuing criticism of U.S. engagement Vietnam. In fact, after Richard Nixon
                    won the presidency in 1970, during the transition President Johnson would not
                    release the program assistance, some $300 million, which had been appropriated
                    by the U.S. Congress for India. In response to my efforts to move these funds to
                    India, President Johnson said, “Let Nixon worry about it when he becomes
                    president. Let the Indians find out how he treats them.”</p>
                <p>I was shocked at this withholding of aid which we had justified to the U.S.
                    Congress as essential to our foreign policy objectives, and which was sorely
                    needed to sustain the development momentum in India. In response to my continued
                    agitation over the issue, both Secretary of State Dean Rusk and AID
                    Administrator Bill Gaud directed me to “lay off and not press the issue further
                    with the White House.” “We are just going to have to accept that President
                    Johnson is not going to release those funds while he is President,” Rusk
                    said.</p>
                <p>Despite that instruction, I made a further plea with Walt Rostow, then security
                    advisor to the President, that considering the importance of our relations with
                    India he again should make the case with President Johnson. Rostow did and
                    President Johnson finally said “OK”. Bill Gaud gave me a hard look after that
                    but said nothing. After all, you couldn't criticize a junior officer for
                    achieving the objective.</p>
                <p>One result for me was that at the beginning of the Nixon Administration Walt
                    Rostow recommended to Henry Kissinger that “Maury Williams is the one to talk
                    to.” So I got a phone call from Kissinger the new national security advisor to
                    President Nixon, to brief him about India. When I called on Kissinger, he said
                    the President is planning a trip to Asia. “I know Europe well but I really don't
                    know much about Asia, tell me what I need to know about India.” I began a
                    briefing as I had done many time with the Congress. But it was clear that
                    Kissinger' attention was not on my briefing. He interrupted, saying “Wait a
                    minute, you'd better come with us on this Asian trip; I'll speak to the
                    President about it”. Apparently, I was the “Mr. India” to the new
                    administration.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you say Kissinger never really got involved at that
                        point? He picked up on you but he didn't pick up on the substance.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Kissinger never returned to the subject. He wanted me there in case
                    there were any questions to be answered. When President Nixon met with Indira
                    Gandhi in India, Kissinger was on the President's right and I was at the table
                    next to Kissinger. It got me onto that trip, the South Asian part, for I didn't
                    accompany President Nixon on the Vietnam portion of his tour of the Far
                    East.</p>
                <p>Let me speak further about my assignment with NESA, since it wasn't all
                    India.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had responsibilities other than India. What were some
                        of the other areas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: The other major AID programs were in Turkey and Pakistan. We had
                    smaller programs with Israel, Jordan, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Afghanistan. At that
                    time, we were phasing out programs in Lebanon and Iran since they no longer
                    required concessionary assistance. And our AID programs in Iraq and Syria were
                    terminated as no longer consonant with U.S. objectives.</p>
                <p>The field mission directors were strong, entrusted with substantial delegations
                    of authority, and for the most part the NESA country programs were quite solid.
                    This meant that aside from fending with the Congress, my job as bureau chief was
                    essentially one of back stopping the field missions and dealing with special
                    problems affecting Washington support. For most of the missions there weren't
                    major problems.</p>
                <p>The programs for Israel, Jordan and Turkey were well supported in the Congress.
                    Aid to Israel was efficiently handled by the Israelis themselves who know their
                    needs well. Jim Killian, our director in Turkey, had an outstanding record of
                    helping to launch South Korea on the path of self-sustaining development, and
                    was urging a similar pace for Turkey. Joe Wheeler was a real pro as mission
                    director in Jordan; I would later send him to Pakistan. We had smaller,
                    technically sound programs in Nepal and Sri Lanka.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Afghanistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: NESA was a fascinating region with a wide range of development problems
                    in human, cultural, social, political and economic terms. Afghanistan was a
                    tremendous problem. We were way over-committed in the size of the U.S. capital
                    and technical assistance activities, competing with the Russians in construction
                    of roads and capital projects in a mad scramble well beyond the institutional
                    and human capacity of a semi-nomadic feudal society.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some describe it as being on the front lines of the Cold
                        War.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Truly on the front line, Khrushchev saw the Cold War as a competition
                    with capitalism, particularly in the non-aligned countries like Afghanistan. He
                    extended large aid credits for industrial and capital equipment to Afghanistan,
                    repayable in long-term exports to the Soviet Union. In response, U.S. aid jumped
                    from a small Point Four type program, mainly in education, to a capital
                    assistance level of some $30 million annually. Much of this competitive aid was
                    for turn-key construction projects by expatriate contractors, which yielded
                    highly visible and politically impressive results. But training Afghans for the
                    use and maintenance of such facilities was something else. Most ambitious was
                    the competition in dams and regional irrigation schemes.</p>
                <p>Even before the cold war competition, the Afghan Government had engaged U.S.
                    private interests to build a dam in the Helmand Valley with U.S. Export-Import
                    Bank credits. The dam was impressive, but there were no prior plans for
                    irrigation channels to distribute the water, nor people trained to manage any
                    aspect of the dam and water usage, nor for development of their agriculture.
                    With American prestige on the line, in the competition with the Russians, the
                    AID Mission was thrust into the position of working out the infrastructure and
                    programs for realizing economic benefits from the dam, a task which proved to be
                    almost impossible. While there were many similarities in development problems of
                    Afghanistan and Iran, the complexities imposed by scale of direct competition
                    with the Soviets were overwhelming.</p>
                <p>As head of the NESA Bureau, I was able to successfully close the AID program in
                    Iran. There you had government ministries somewhat more capable than in
                    Afghanistan, although similarly shot through with traditional inefficiencies.
                    Nevertheless, we succeed in integrating the AID sponsored activities in
                    education, health and agriculture into the Iranian ministries with the Shah
                    claiming that these programs were his “white revolution.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you take a moment and tell why we terminated the
                        program in Iran, what were the characteristics of that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Iran's oil revenues had fully recovered which meant they didn't need
                    continued concessionary aid. USAID had been largely a technical mission which
                    had trained many Iranians. While the initial rationale for aid had been heavily
                    political, a fairly sound base had been established, particularly in health and
                    education, and reasonable beginnings made in agriculture. Also it was timely to
                    phase down large U.S. technical aid missions. As nationals were trained, U.S.
                    advisors needed to pull out. One way and another U.S. personnel locked into
                    these technical assignments. There was an inertia that was hard to break. I
                    broke it in Iran because our political profile was too high, too many advisors
                    in prominent locations. That would become a problem later in other countries as
                    well.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>It also was important to demonstrate progress with our aid programs to the
                    Congress and American people. We felt that we could terminate in Iran, as well
                    as in Lebanon, and declare reasonable success. And we were working with the
                    Government of Turkey toward phasing out concessionary aid over a five year
                    period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were involved in the Helmand Valley, one of the major
                        projects over the years. What were you able to accomplish there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: The results of our efforts in the Helmand Valley were disappointing,
                    considering the efforts involved. As I mentioned above, the major dam was
                    initiated by the Afghans with funds borrowed from the Export Import Bank and
                    built by a U.S. engineering firm, Morrison-Knudsen, without preliminary surveys
                    of its possible use. With American prestige on the line, AID inherited the task
                    of developing the potential of the valley. It proved a daunting enterprise,
                    bedeviled by a secession of severe problems. First, settlers were brought in who
                    lacked basic agricultural skills and there were knotty problems of land tenure.
                    This complicated the laying out of channels for water distribution. Soil surveys
                    revealed that large areas of the valley were an impermeable hard pan which
                    complicated irrigation and drainage. The remoteness of the valley and its thin
                    settlement limited power development. Newly settled “farmers” required all sorts
                    of services which meant building up a support authority. Nor was there the human
                    resource base on the Afghan side to support this level and type of activity. It
                    had to be built-up from scratch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to deal with some of those problems, address
                        them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: We worked at it and gradually made progress. Wheat crop yields were
                    reasonable. But management of such a complex project did not go very well. We
                    trained personnel for the Helmand Valley Authority but the demand for
                    experienced Afghan managers was great and personnel kept being drawn to other
                    facilities. Also Afghan Government interest in the Helmand Valley appeared to
                    wane and it was a continuing struggle to engage them. By then three-quarters of
                    their development budget was financed by external aid. Despite these poor
                    prospects we had to stay at it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Staying there, did that serve our political ends?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: That's what it served and in many ways that's all it served. Eventually
                    it would have been possible to built the resource base to realize benefits from
                    the high level of capital assistance. Many of the projects were for political
                    show, like the airport we built. When the political criteria is so high, and
                    with the Cold War competition with the Russians, it was impossible to do things
                    in a sequence and on a scale that would be sensible in development terms. Also,
                    the Russians and we were working at cross purposes, not only politically but in
                    development planning concepts and the pressures we each mounted on Afghan
                    officials.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There isn't much left of Afghanistan at the moment, but
                        did you leave anything of development consequence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Roads; we built a first class road system opening Afghan communication
                    in the south and with Pakistan. The Russians built roads in the north to their
                    own border. Many Afghans were trained, but God knows what has happened to them.
                    We placed a major emphasis on education and human resource development, building
                    many schools. We worked at it very hard and on a large scale. You can work these
                    things out with time, but time was short for Afghanistan, particularly after the
                    Russian invasion.</p>
                <p>In other countries - Turkey, Pakistan, India - it is possible to go back and
                    point out American aid contributions, the scientific and agricultural institutes
                    in India, the entire school system in Bangladesh, and many others. There was
                    progress in Afghanistan but you can't find it today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Carry on with your comments on other NESA programs. What
                        was happening to the Pakistan program? You had a personal interest in
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: It was a solid program. As a result of the 1965 war, there was a
                    temporary interruption of new commitments of aid of a year for both Pakistan and
                    India. Drought in that period also was a set back for both countries, although
                    it was more serious for India. The U.S. got back on a development footing, the
                    aid donor consortium was revived and we began to make aid commitments again.
                    However, our aid program to Pakistan never recovered its earlier high level.
                    After President Johnson's call to Ayub Khan, our political relations were
                    reestablished, although Pakistan still pursued a pro-Chinese diplomacy which the
                    State Department was unhappy about.</p>
                <p>There were several unusual situations concerning Congressional difficulties with
                    AID contracts for Pakistan which engaged my attention. One was an AID tender for
                    the purchase of locomotives by Pakistan with AID funds. General Electric and
                    General Motors were competing for this contract. Each had powerful senators
                    behind them; Senator Percy was backing GM, and Senator Long backed GE. It wasn't
                    a particularly large order, about $12 million, but apparently it was seen as an
                    important opening to the Asian market.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>Resolution of this difficult issue fell to me as Assistant Administrator early in
                    my tenure. AID Administrator Bill Gaud pointed out that it was important to
                    retain the support of both Senator Percy and Senator Long. Gaud said to me,
                    “Good luck, Maury, I'm watching this one. I hope you get it right.”</p>
                <p>For some time I struggled to find a fair and defensible basis for awarding the
                    bid but a solution eluded me. AID lawyers examining the tender documents could
                    find no legal basis for a decision. Nor was there a technical basis for
                    determining whether GE or GM built the better locomotive for Pakistan's needs.
                    All the knowledgeable locomotive experts I consulted had worked for either GE or
                    GM. Representatives of both companies called on me, and staff assistants of the
                    interested senators kept phoning to inquire how I would decide. Well, I just
                    couldn't figure it out.</p>
                <p>Finally, in desperation, I hit on the amazing device of asking for a ruling from
                    the GAO - the General Accounting Office — which is the
                    Congressionally-designated “watch dog” over executive branch performance. They
                    fairly quickly advised in favor of GE, and I so awarded the contract. I
                    suspected that the reason GAO came down in favor of GE was that Senator Long had
                    more political clout with GAO than Senator Percy. Never mind, I told myself,
                    with GAO support I was in the clear.</p>
                <p>Several months later I found myself with another near intractable problem
                    involving AID financed power boats for East Pakistan. The boats were required to
                    inspect an extensive system of dikes, or bunds, built to reclaim land from salt
                    water intrusion along coastal areas. Much of East Pakistan was a low lying delta
                    and with dikes they were able to reclaim from the sea substantial areas of
                    fertile land, much like the Dutch in the Netherlands. The speed of power boats
                    for inspecting dikes was important because storms in the Bay of Bengal could
                    come up fast. The AID financed contract had been awarded to a boat builder,
                    Holiday Boats, in Congressman Passman's district in Mississippi. When the boats
                    were delivered to East Pakistan, they were rejected as not meeting contract
                    specifications for speed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this still part of Pakistan or was it now
                        Bangladesh?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Still Pakistan. It turned out that the owner of Holiday Boats was a
                    leading politician and key supporter of Otto Passman. Moreover, the Pakistan
                    boat order was a big one for a small company like Holiday Boats, and rejection
                    of the boats by Pakistan would bankrupt the company. To add to this drama,
                    Passman was coming up for reelection, and without the support of the owner of
                    Holiday Boats, it was alleged that Passman was not going to get reelected. Only
                    after Passman had attempted to negotiate directly with the Government of
                    Pakistan for acceptance of the boats and been refused, did he appeal to me for
                    help.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>On review, I found that Holiday Boats had accepted specifications for high
                    performance motors which could not possibly be built with the AID funds
                    allocated to the contract. USAID engineers had passed those specifications. So
                    then the boats didn't meet the specs and the Pakistanis refused to accept them.
                    Since Passman was the chairman of the appropriations subcommittee for AID, I had
                    to sort this out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you sort it out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: First of all the Pakistan AID Mission had made a mistake in letting
                    such impossibly high performance specifications go through. AID had delegated
                    much responsibility to the field with requisite engineers and loan officers
                    in-country and they had goofed on this. So I apologized to the government of
                    Pakistan, and promised to make it up to them in other ways if they accepted the
                    boats. Fortunately the boats were well built and proved acceptable for the
                    purpose intended.</p>
                <p>Perhaps that is all I need to say about my experiences as head of the NESA
                    bureau. I had clearly established my credentials as an Assistant Administrator
                    in handling congressional relations and directing field missions. Bill Gaud on
                    one occasion asked me if I didn't think it was truly fascinating work. Gaud had
                    been NESA head in the Kennedy administration, followed by Bill MacComber, and
                    then myself. I replied that running a bureau in many respects was the seamy
                    underside of foreign aid, essential to support development but that the best
                    jobs were those of country mission directors.</p>
                <p>Among the compensations in running an AID bureau was the association with wholly
                    dedicated people. AID had great strength in talented and experienced officers;
                    the senior staff assembled by Dave Bell and Bill Gaud were truly outstanding -
                    people like Rud Poats and Sam Adams.</p>
                <p>With the election of President Nixon in 1968, the support for President Kennedy's
                    program of development assistance had run out. Nixon redefined U.S. foreign
                    policy in an international system of relative political equilibrium, or detente,
                    between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, with China as a potential counter in that
                    power equation. One aspect of that policy was to break the link of U.S. aid to
                    economic performance and, rather, relate aid to political performance by
                    recipients. In any case, Nixon was not about to invest political capital in the
                    programs of his predecessors and the 1970s witnessed a dramatic redirection of
                    American aid.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>You will recall that at Henry Kissinger's invitation, I was a member of President
                    Nixon's mission to New Delhi. There, I heard President Nixon tell Indira Gandhi
                    the importance he attributed to opening relations with China in the context of
                    his foreign policy. Given the history of American policy toward Communist China
                    and Nixon's earlier role in that history, I was astonished. I looked at Indira
                    Gandhi to observe her reaction. She wasn't paying one bit of attention to what
                    Nixon was saying. As far as she was concerned it was just “blah blah,” as
                    Kissinger observed in an aside. I took it seriously and was quite excited about
                    what I heard. Relations with China had been such a problem in American foreign
                    policy; if this was to be resolved, Nixon was the man who could bring it
                    off.</p>
                <p>While reform of the aid program was not an initial priority of the Nixon
                    Administration, it was clear that what was intended was a primary focus on
                    security assistance administered by State, with sharp curtailment of aid for
                    economic development. AID as an agency would be phased out, its technical field
                    missions greatly reduced to lower the American profile abroad. And what ever
                    capital assistance might be required could be handled by the World Bank along
                    with a quasi-public foundation for technical assistance. These were essentially
                    the recommendations of the Peterson Commission charged to advise President Nixon
                    on the reform of foreign aid. There were many other proposals. It was a very
                    fluid and confused time.</p>
                <p>John Hannah was appointed by the Nixon Administration as the new administrator of
                    AID. A former president of Michigan State University, Hannah had impeccable
                    party credentials, although with a liberal dedication to the importance of Third
                    World development, and particularly to education and human development. As
                    Hannah would say over and over, “It's people who are important, people make
                    development happen.”</p>
                <p>Finding himself the administrator of an agency that was threatened with
                    extinction, John Hannah looked to the AID assistant administrators, and senior
                    staff he had inherited, asking “What are we going to do about this, what do you
                    professionals recommend?” Hannah took the senior staff to Airlie House one
                    weekend for a brain storming session on what needed to be done to revise the AID
                    program in the light of the new circumstances and political realities. We
                    engaged in quite a bull session which produced many good ideas. Sam Adams was
                    there, Ernie Stern, Phil Birnbaum, Herman Kleine, the whole team of senior AID
                    officials. At the end of Sunday afternoon, John Hannah turned to me and said,
                    “Maury, will you write this up in the form of a proposal that I can take to the
                    administration?”</p>
                <p>I did that for the next three weeks, thinking hard on how the AID program should
                    be restructured and I wrote a fairly brief proposal. As it turned out that paper
                    based on the Airlie House discussions determined the shape of the reoriented
                    AID.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>Basically what I proposed was a bifurcation of assistance into two programs, both
                    administered by a reoriented AID - one for security assistance allocated to
                    countries in direct support of immediate foreign policy objectives, and a second
                    to address basic human needs allocated on a functional basis in support of mid-
                    to longer-term American objectives.</p>
                <p>U.S. aid for supporting assistance, in fact, had been largely politicized in
                    support of the war in Vietnam. It was important to take account of the need of
                    the Nixon administration to mobilize all instruments to settle that war, and to
                    deal with the aftermath of the 1967 war in the Middle East.</p>
                <p>The proposed emphasis on basic human needs dealt with the reality that the aid
                    policy of accelerating economic growth in developing countries was by-passing
                    millions of the poorest people. While nation building had been successful, the
                    effect on poverty alleviation had been limited and the policies of aggregate
                    economic growth had failed to take account of essential social objectives. What
                    I proposed was changing aid appropriations and accounts to functional
                    allocations in such priority areas as agriculture, human nutrition, education,
                    population programs, health care, and special programs targeted on poor and
                    disadvantaged groups.</p>
                <p>This was not a new idea; it was common knowledge that economic growth, as such,
                    was not affecting the inequity of mass poverty and that meeting basic human
                    needs - as recommended by the ILO - required attention. Perhaps the way I framed
                    the proposal was helpful, for it appealed both to the realpolitik policy of
                    President Nixon, and to the strong moral tradition of American foreign policy,
                    as well.</p>
                <p>John Hannah proved a skillful advocate of the bifurcated programs in a reoriented
                    AID. Hannah sent the proposal to President Nixon, and it is fair to say that the
                    administration found it only half appealing.</p>
                <p>More significant John Hannah quietly gave a copy of that paper to the Chairman of
                    the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Doc Morgan of Pennsylvania. Morgan agreed
                    to launch a congressional initiative to redirect a functional reorganization of
                    the aid accounts and legislation in support of human needs. At that time, the
                    Democrats had a majority in the Congress, the Republicans had the Presidency.
                    The Democrats did not want to see the development emphasis of foreign aid
                    completely scrapped in favor of security assistance as it had been in the
                    Eisenhower period. The Democratic majority in Congress, led by the Foreign
                    Affairs Committee, took the initiative of redirecting aid in functional accounts
                    for basic human needs while strongly supporting the security assistance
                    component for foreign aid.</p>
                <p>Congressional interest also was stimulated by the emergence during the 1960s of
                    an active domestic constituency of special interest groups favoring development
                    assistance to address poverty. They included church and university groups,
                    research and technical specialists, former Peace Corp volunteers, and others -
                    many of whom had been specifically encouraged by AID.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>I don't think Hannah ever informed the administration of his quiet diplomacy in
                    stimulating the congressional initiative for redrafting the foreign aid
                    legislation. That is how the “new directions” program for foreign aid came
                    about. The initiative did come from the Congress, and the functional aid
                    accounts would over time be increasingly monitored and controlled by
                    Congressional action. It was engendered by Hannah; all I did was write up a set
                    of proposals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Beyond the bifurcation of the program, the economic
                        support, were there any other features you emphasized in this proposal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: It is one thing to lay out some broad concepts and categories. For this
                    I drew on the ILO Report and views expressed by the Nordic countries in a review
                    of development assistance. But a lot of follow-up work was required to translate
                    concepts into actual programs and projects. For one, legislation had to be
                    rewritten, a task which Jim Grant and the Overseas Development Council (ODC)
                    undertook. A lot of people would claim credit for redirecting aid to meet the
                    basic human needs of the poorest of the poor.</p>
                <p>Deputy Administrator of AID, 1971-1974</p>
                <p>Since I was a carry-over appointee from the previous administration, I thought it
                    timely to leave government in favor of an academic position. There was an
                    opening for dean of international studies at the University of Denver and I was
                    invited to apply. I spoke to John Hannah about it, thinking that he might
                    support me for the position. On the contrary, he discouraged me, saying being a
                    dean wouldn't be right for me.</p>
                <p>Shortly afterwards, Hannah asked me to become his deputy at AID. He had the
                    support of President Nixon, perhaps because of my having been on the President's
                    earlier trip to Asia and the contact with Henry Kissinger. I had become
                    Kissinger's man in AID, responding to occasional calls for information.</p>
                <p>My first task as deputy was to begin to put into operation the “new directions”
                    for development assistance. Hannah was anxious for us to take the initiative in
                    redirecting the AID program to meet basic human needs, in advance of
                    Congressional action and new legislation. How should we conceptualize the change
                    in program? You had to think through the implications in program focus in terms
                    of guidance to agency staffs for the next congressional presentation, to work
                    out aid levels with the Bureau of the Budget, and formulate instructions to the
                    field missions. Obviously you had to restructure your mission programs and this
                    required new operating procedures. There was a lot of work to be done, and we
                    set up internal task forces on various tasks.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile I was eager to exchange views about these new directions in the field
                    and undertook a mission to Africa to brief the mission directors.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: It was in 1971 that I met with the mission directors in Africa. In
                    Lagos, I met with Don Brown and other mission directors. I recall Don was
                    aggressively skeptical about how the changes we proposed were going to work. I
                    went to the field to get the help of our field officers, saying, “Look, this is
                    what we've got to do; how can it best be done?”</p>
                <p>While it took some doing to reorient our program, country by country, in one
                    sense we were returning to the earlier Point Four concept of technical
                    assistance. In the new AID legislation that part of the program was looked after
                    by the Democratic majority in the Congress. They earmarked functional categories
                    of aid for development because they didn't trust the Nixon administration not to
                    divert it to political security concerns. AID country programming was not
                    completely abandoned but it was more project focused - with priorities for
                    health, education, agriculture and nutrition - rather than on a national
                    economic focus. That was the major shift on the development assistance side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the push at addressing the “poor majority”, a
                        phrase at the time. And then there was the “poorest of the poor” — an effort
                        never really very effective.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: When I was working on programming, we were concerned with alleviating
                    poverty; later the approach became that if we weren't reaching the poorest of
                    the poor, we were assumed to be failing. That was an extreme point of view which
                    was never part of my direction. It got out of control after I left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That came with the next administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Right, it happened in the Carter administration. It was unfortunate; I
                    thought it went too far. Development has to be more broadly conceived than
                    solely targeting the poorest, as praiseworthy as that may seem.</p>
                <p>But we were able to retain a functioning AID agency addressing development needs.
                    Of course Vietnam was a big problem, drawing increasingly large resources. We
                    were forced to scale back aid levels and technical missions in many developing
                    countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any involvement in the administration's
                        Vietnam effort?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I spent several weeks in Vietnam to review our program and the
                    situation, but I can't say I had any real involvement. It was nothing I worked
                    on to try and change. I saw the program on the ground, traveling throughout the
                    delta. It was a dangerous time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What view did you develop about our effort there and our
                        program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Some of our best people were in Vietnam. Bob Mossler, for example, was
                    Mission Director. It seemed an impossible task, trying to encourage rural
                    development under warlike conditions. Security was very bad. The war was going
                    on. You had to move around with great caution. I traveled by boat, road and
                    helicopter. It was dangerous even with a military escort. Our people in the
                    field were courageous, and their presence may have been a positive influence in
                    encouraging South Vietnam resistance, but for achieving effective development
                    under the circumstances, that was very limited.</p>
                <p>After directing reorientation of the Agency's program and field visits to each of
                    the major regions, I settled in as John Hannah's deputy. It was a pleasure to
                    work for Hannah as a person with great political savvy. He personally handled
                    relations with senior congressmen and with the senior White House staffs, and
                    looked to me to run AID operationally. Hannah said, “Maury you run the agency
                    and keep me posted.” That wasn't so difficult given the outstanding assistant
                    administrators in change of the regional bureaus.</p>
                <p>As an agency administrator I attempted to model my role on Bill Gaud's earlier
                    example when he had been Dave Bell's deputy. Like Gaud, I made a point of
                    undertaking to educate the American public on the importance of foreign aid to
                    our national interest by a series of public speeches and media interviews. Over
                    several years, these included engagements in Atlanta, Colorado Springs,
                    Louisville, Miami, New Orleans, New York, St Louis, Minneapolis, as well as
                    similar engagements in Washington.</p>
                <p>Hannah assigned me the task of liaison with Henry Kissinger's National Security
                    staff and with Congressman Otto Passman as Chairman of the committee charged
                    with foreign aid appropriations. I don't believe Hannah was comfortable with
                    either of them, certainly not with Passman who retained almost absolute power
                    over aid appropriations.</p>
                <p>My job was to accommodate Passman's requests for information and favors, in so
                    far as they were defensible. Hardly a week passed without my receiving one or
                    more phone calls from Passman, often for favors concerning aid to American
                    schools and hospitals abroad, and PL 480 allocations of rice - which was
                    produced and exported from his district. He also followed closely details of the
                    procurement of AID-financed commodities for Vietnam.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>One decision I made in response to persistent urging by Passman proved
                    controversial, namely funding a million dollar project for Latin American
                    leadership training by Airlie House. While the project was defensible, it was
                    opposed as low priority by AID's Latin American staff and I overrode them.
                    Several years later, after I left Washington, I was recalled twice to testify at
                    a Grand Jury investigation to explain my decision. Apparently, Passman had been
                    bribed by Airlie House to gain AID approval of the project. I was cleared of
                    collusion and had no knowledge of any payoff, but had to admit that I had gone
                    against staff advice. Passman, who at that point had retired from the Congress,
                    was tried and cleared of any offense by a jury in his home state.</p>
                <p>My liaison with Kissinger's staff at the White House often concerned AID's role
                    in international emergency assistance for natural and other disasters, including
                    drought in the Sahel of Africa, a destructive typhoon in East Pakistan, and the
                    earthquake which destroyed Managua in Nicaragua. In each of these instances, I
                    was formally designated as President Nixon's representative in change of overall
                    American emergency assistance. This provided high visibility in publicity for
                    AID, as well as for the President. AID had built an effective Office of
                    Emergency Operations under Tim McClure. I also learned that emergency assistance
                    involved special skills for early assessment and response, guiding voluntary
                    public assistance, and coordinating efforts among donors, both public and
                    private. The 1972-1973 drought in the countries of the Sahel - an Arab term
                    meaning shore of the sea of the Sahara Desert - was disastrous for seven African
                    countries from Senegal to Chad, wiping out their sources of food in crops and
                    animal herds. Many countries and agencies responded with emergency food and
                    supplies but lines of transport into the region were poor and several millions
                    of people were at risk of starvation. Nor was there agreement on international
                    coordination of emergency aid. The U.N. at that time lacked the designated role
                    and capability for the work. Calls by FAO for massive airlifts of food without
                    on the ground assessments of needs were not helpful. I conferred in Paris with
                    the French Government, which knew the region well, and together we adopted a
                    framework for assessing needs, locating supplies and related logistic
                    capabilities.</p>
                <p>President Nixon directed a major U.S. response to the drought emergency in
                    Africa, in part to build his political support in the American black community.
                    As the President's representative I was assigned a military aircraft to visit
                    the Sahel countries and assure that emergency supplies were getting there. I
                    flew across the Sahel visiting each of the Sahel countries, calling on their
                    Presidents, and inspecting relief operations. Adequate relief assistance was
                    getting through, although only by a very narrow margin.</p>
                <p>Haven, you were in Africa at that time, were you involved?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was in Ghana.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: The situation in Ghana and most of the coastal states were not badly
                    affected by the drought, with the exception of Senegal, the Gambia and
                    Mauritania and stretching eastward across the continent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sam Adams and Don Brown were in charge of the Africa
                        Bureau at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Yes Sam Adams was the Assistant Administrator and I believe Don Brown
                    was his deputy.</p>
                <p>The relief operation had three planes - operated by the U.S., Belgium and Canada
                    - to selectively airlift emergency food to Bamako, Niamey, and Agadez, and we
                    were barely getting it there in time to save lives. I remember visiting one
                    location in Niger where the local administrator said, “If it hadn't been for
                    your help, we would all be dead in this area.” Their food supplies had been
                    completed wiped out; it was quite dramatic. On that trip I also visited the
                    refugee camps on the upper bend of the Niger River. That part of the river had
                    dried up but I was interested to see Timbuktu. I was curious to know why
                    Timbuktu was a household world with most Americans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The remotest of the remote.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Perhaps it was because at an earlier time, Timbuktu was seen as a magic
                    place where as a trading post you could exchange salt for gold. There was gold
                    to the south but they lacked salt; if you could cross the Sahara Desert with
                    camels you could pick up salt slabs and at Timbuktu trade them for gold, so the
                    story goes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Saharan countries that you
                        visited at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: The drought had devastating effects; many of the men had migrated to
                    the south attempting to save their herds, leaving their women and children
                    behind in the camps I visited. Mostly they were unsuccessful, and wealth in
                    animals was largely lost. The drought shifted the balance of power between the
                    nomadic people of Arab origin and the blacks whom they had largely dominated.
                    There was much settling of old scores among these people, including
                    discrimination in distribution of relief supplies.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>In the settled agricultural areas the losses had also been great. There was
                    potential for rural development in improved water management and security
                    measures against drought, a recurring problem for the region. Trained Africans
                    were able but few in number. Despite the difficulties of development in Africa,
                    progress could be made if you could engage the best people available and help
                    governments strengthen their structures of administration and cooperation. I
                    thought the best prospect for the Sahel countries was in regional cooperation
                    for mutual support and to take advantage of the increased aid being offered for
                    rehabilitation. The Sahel leaders would later set up a consortium for a regional
                    approach among themselves and with donors. In my next assignment I would lead a
                    donor Club du Sahel to foster development in the region.</p>
                <p>The earthquake in Managua brought me another assignment as the President's
                    representative for emergency assistance. In this case, President Nixon phoned me
                    one weekend at my retreat on the Potomac River in West Virginia which I told him
                    was my Camp David. He said “I want you to go to Managua and take charge of the
                    relief effort. I'm concerned that the communists may take over the country.
                    Somoza is a personal friend of mine; I will have a letter for you to carry to
                    him.”</p>
                <p>The following Monday I was briefed at the White House on the situation in
                    Nicaragua and the nature of the mission. I had presidential authority to engage
                    whatever resources were necessary to deal with the results of the earthquake
                    which had destroyed the capital city. Then I was asked to brief the assembled
                    White House press corp on the effects of the earthquake and the nature of my
                    mission. President Nixon's interest in the Managua disaster was both to help his
                    political buddy, President Somoza, and to highlight a highly visible U.S.
                    humanitarian effort, partly as a distraction of media attention from the bombing
                    of Hanoi then underway.</p>
                <p>I flew to Nicaragua by military helicopter from a U.S. army base in Panama. What
                    was left of Managua was a desolation of rubble that was still smoldering from
                    fire which had swept the city. All central services had been disrupted and
                    people had fled to surrounding areas. A U.S. military field hospital in tents on
                    the outskirts was treating the injured. The central relief problem was food and
                    its distribution. Even before the earthquake, there had been a failure of
                    agricultural production and there was a problem of insufficient food supply.</p>
                <p>Nicaragua is a relatively small country with nearby U.S. military logistical
                    facilities in Panama, the Central American U.S. Command. Very quickly we were
                    able to call forward large supplies of food and tents for shelter and to have
                    these supplies airlifted to various distribution points by large U.S. army cargo
                    helicopters. Local Nicaraguan authorities in nearby towns organized the
                    distribution of supplies. I visited these centers to assure their reasonable
                    effectiveness. It didn't take too long. In comparison with emergency relief for
                    a large Asian country or African region, the logistics and distribution were
                    quite easy.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>Of interest was the U.S. Army field hospital which was now routinely servicing
                    what had been the city of Managua. Initially there had been casualties, many
                    resulting from gunshot wounds, which led me to believe there may have been an
                    attempted revolt against Somoza as President Nixon had worried about.</p>
                <p>However, the calls on the hospital were now few and fairly routine. While the
                    local city hospital had been destroyed, most of its personnel had survived. The
                    sensible thing was to turn the equipment of the U.S. Army field hospital over to
                    local medical personnel, which is what I did without prior permission from the
                    Defense Department. It was perhaps a bold move, but I didn't see any reason to
                    lose time or to leave Americans sitting there in the sun in tents with little or
                    nothing to do. Several days later I received a cable from the Defense
                    Department: “Please Mr. Williams, don't give our engineering equipment away, we
                    need it.” There was an army engineering group there helping to clear away the
                    debris, and I wasn't about to give that away.</p>
                <p>There was an AID Mission in Nicaragua which I naturally drew on for assistance in
                    the relief operation. We began planning for a housing rehabilitation program and
                    other activities, and I prepared to depart. Somoza was quite a character.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you meet him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Oh, definitely, I reported to President Somoza first thing on my
                    arrival since I carried a personal message for him from President Nixon. I also
                    met with his senior officials to review organization of the relief operation.
                    His residence was on a hill overlooking the ruins of Managua and there was a
                    platoon of American infantry soldiers armed and camped on the site - apparently
                    there by order of President Nixon.</p>
                <p>Before departing, I called on President Somoza to bid him farewell. He said he
                    would be at the airfield early the next morning to see me off and asked that I
                    carry a written message to President Nixon. I demurred about Somoza coming to
                    see me off, but he replied, “I will be there, not for you personally but because
                    you are the representative of the President of the United States.”</p>
                <p>The next morning, after a helicopter flight, I boarded a commercial Pan Am plane
                    at about 6 a.m., when the pilot received a message, “Do not depart until I,
                    Somoza, President of this country, get there to bid farewell to President
                    Nixon's representative.” The Pan Am pilot replied “That's not possible.”
                    Somoza's then radioed, “You wait for my arrival, or you will never land in this
                    country again.” The Pan Am crew decided to wait and some 45 minutes later Somoza
                    and his cabinet arrived at plane side. They lined up. I went down the line
                    giving each a farewell embrace, then enplaned with a wave. They stood at
                    attention while the plane took off. I suppose there is a certain style among
                    Latin American dictators.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of impression did you get of Somoza as a person?
                        Did you get any kind of feel for him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: He was a large and genial man with American manners, having trained at
                    West Point. He welcomed me warmly; I believe he was frightened by the
                    destruction and confusion of the earthquake. Most of the police, fire and
                    security forces would have been immobilized, many disappearing to save
                    themselves and their families. Discipline was probably poor. In that chaotic
                    situation Somoza must have sent an urgent call for help to President Nixon, who
                    sent a U.S. army unit to guard the Somoza residence.</p>
                <p>Somoza impressed me as an entrepreneurial type. Certainly he had extensive
                    business monopoly interests and apparently was milking the country economically.
                    I had set up reasonably firm accounting for U.S. relief supplies, looking to
                    municipal and religious authorities for their distribution. However, I found
                    that relief supplies from other countries and private agencies were being
                    received by Somoza's son, a young man in the uniform of an army lieutenant, who
                    stored them in a locked warehouse outside the city. One had a sense of
                    inefficiency and corruption. I urged the opening of that warehouse and public
                    distribution of those supplies, but couldn't be sure it was done.</p>
                <p>Another Presidential assignment was to manage relief operations for a disaster in
                    East Pakistan, which evolved in stages, beginning with typhoon destruction in
                    the delta and progressively leading to political insurrection against the
                    central government and military action by the West Pakistan army.</p>
                <p>Periodically East Pakistan, now Bangladesh, is afflicted by a great storm with
                    high winds out of the Bay of Bengal which may combine with tidal action to
                    generate a high wave — sometimes up to 20 feet or more — that sweeps across the
                    low lying delta. Dense concentrations of very poor people live there on land
                    barely above sea level, and the destruction of these storms is tremendous. Again
                    as the President's representative I toured the area by helicopter to inspect
                    relief operations. Joe Wheeler was the AID Mission Director in Pakistan and we
                    had an experienced field staff in East Pakistan. The emergency relief went well,
                    and the AID Mission began to assist with rehabilitation measures which included
                    measures of future security for people against recurring storms.</p>
                <p>The extensive destruction and hardship from the storm, and East Pakistani sense
                    of neglect by the government in the West, aggravated already deeply seated
                    grievances against the central Pakistan government. In response to the charge
                    that no central government leader had visited the province at the time of the
                    great storm, President Yahya Khan claimed that he had viewed the disaster area
                    in an overflight while on the way to visit China - a claim which was treated
                    with derision in East Pakistan.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>Later in 1971 an East Pakistan political party, the Awami League, won a national
                    election on a platform of provincial autonomy. Fearing an independent breakaway
                    of East Pakistan, President Yahya dispatched a West Pakistan army of 70,000
                    troops under General Tikka Khan who waged a brutal war of “collective
                    punishment” against the Awami and its followers, targeting the intellectuals of
                    East Pakistan. A guerrilla insurgency, the Mukti Bahini, fought back in a
                    widening civil conflict.</p>
                <p>The reign of terror only served to fuel resistance of a growing force of Mukti
                    Bahini insurgents who, with the support of India, were engaged in cross border
                    raids and occupying parts of East Pakistan. The result was a massive human
                    tragedy with tremendous political reverberations. Tens of thousands of civilians
                    were killed, nine million East Pakistan refugees fled to camps in India and
                    millions more were displaced from their homes within East Pakistan. Physical
                    destruction of facilities, including transport, and economic dislocation was
                    extensive. East Pakistan with 75 million people existing on an average annual
                    income of $55, most living on the edge of survival, was in imminent danger of
                    mass famine.</p>
                <p>A wide donor effect was mounted to assist India in supplying emergency assistance
                    for the millions of refugees in camps set up on the border with East Pakistan,
                    but it was impossible to gain safe passage for food and relief supplies to East
                    Pakistan without a cessation of hostilities. Meanwhile political repercussions
                    were becoming increasingly serious, as China favored Pakistan and Soviet Union
                    supported India. The Nixon administration was encountering increased
                    Congressional and domestic hostility for its apparent “tilt toward Pakistan.”
                    President Nixon grand strategy of detente involved reconciliation with China,
                    and Pakistan's friendship with China was an essential bridge.</p>
                <p>At several national security staff meetings chaired by Henry Kissinger, I urged
                    U.S. intervention with the Pakistan Government to seek a cease fire. Perhaps for
                    that reason Kissinger asked me to deliver an oral message from President Nixon
                    to President Yahya Khan asking him to declare a cease fire in East Pakistan, to
                    relieve General Tikka Khan from command of the army on the east, to appoint a
                    civilian governor, and to accept a UN mission in Dacca to administer emergency
                    relief.</p>
                <p>Secretary of State William Rogers and I called on U.N. Secretary-General U Thant
                    to gain his support for a U.N. humanitarian mission in East Pakistan. U Thant
                    paused, observing that there was no precedent for such a U.N. mission, but there
                    was nothing in the U.N. Charter against it. “Yes, I'll do it”, he said. That
                    decision indeed did set a precedent as the first U.N. emergency relief
                    mission.</p>
                <p>The message I was to deliver to President Yahya Khan was considered so sensitive
                    that it was not put in writing. I was to deliver it orally. I carried a letter
                    bearing President Nixon's signature which read, “Maury Williams is a friend of
                    Pakistan. He speaks for me.”</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>Arriving in Islamabad, I noted that the local newspaper, Dawn, had an editorial
                    about my arrival, cautioning against foreign interference. I called my good
                    friend, the chief economic minister, M.M. Ahmad, and at tea that afternoon I
                    briefed him on the nature of my message. I asked Minister Ahmad to convey the
                    contents of my message to the President in advance of my meeting with him at
                    10:00 a.m. the next morning.</p>
                <p>The next morning and I met with President Yahya Khan who was in full military
                    uniform, with all decorations, and delivered the letter which said I spoke for
                    the President of the United States. He took the unfolded letter and sailed it
                    across the room, saying “So, you have a letter from your President.” And he
                    began to swear a steady blue streak for about twelve minutes. He had been a
                    sergeant-major in the British colonial army and no junior officer could have
                    been more verbally abused. With head bowed, I thought this mission is really
                    blown.</p>
                <p>Suddenly there was a pause as Yahya cleared his throat and said gruffly, “We
                    welcome you. We know you are a friend of Pakistan.” He had given vent to the
                    frustration of his situation with the Pakistan army totally out of control and
                    running amok in the east, killing thousands of civilians, driving millions of
                    refugees into India, and risking the loss of East Pakistan.</p>
                <p>President Yahya Khan then accepted the U.S. proposal to recall General Tikka
                    Khan. He also agreed to appoint a civilian governor and to work for a cease
                    fire. While Yahya Khan didn't think there would be famine in East Pakistan, he
                    accepted that we might be right in our assessment and he agreed to accept the
                    U.N. humanitarian mission. We wanted a laissez passer for food and relief
                    supplies to meet humanitarian needs in East Pakistan, a laissez passer for ships
                    under U.N. flag that both sides could respect as not carrying military
                    equipment. That was part of the rationale for the UN mission.</p>
                <p>I then flew on to Dacca in East Pakistan. The destruction was extensive with 90
                    per cent of all transport - rail, road and water - largely disrupted. There were
                    about 40,000 guerrillas in the field at that point, operating out of sanctuaries
                    on the Indian side. Food supplies were low and badly distributed. I was briefed
                    by the intelligence staff of the Pakistan army and had dinner with General Tikka
                    Khan. He was a pretty cold fish. Collective punishment was his policy, a term he
                    spoke of as you and I might say “good morning.” On my departure from Dacca, at
                    the airport I met the special emissary of President Yahya Khan carrying the
                    message to relieve Tikka Khan. We acknowledged each other with a nod in
                    passing.</p>
                <p>I returned to Washington and, subsequently, the division of Pakistan with the
                    independence of the new state of Bangladesh became history. The policies we
                    proposed for Pakistan were right, but they were late, too late. The attack of
                    the Indian army posed a critical situation for our foreign policy. Pakistan lost
                    an army and its eastern wing.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>My next political assignment was a big one, namely principal U.S. negotiator in
                    Paris with ministers of the North Vietnamese Government on allocation of a
                    program of U.S. economic assistance totaling $4.75 billion over five years for
                    the reconstruction of the economy of North Vietnam. This commitment had been
                    made by President Nixon in a secret letter to the Prime Minister of North
                    Vietnam as part of the understandings accompanying the January 1973 “Peace
                    Agreement on Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Vietnam.” The economic
                    assistance was conditioned on political performance by the Government of North
                    Vietnam in releasing American prisoners-of-war and keeping the peace following
                    the cease fire in Vietnam and withdrawal of its forces from Laos and
                    Cambodia.</p>
                <p>American economic assistance for reconstruction of North Vietnam, and its
                    integration into the world economy, was a bold concept of President Nixon. He
                    considered it as “potentially the most significant part of the peace accords,”
                    providing leverage for the U.S. in maintenance of peace. Such had been the case
                    after our wars with Germany and Japan. However, it was only briefly a
                    possibility with North Vietnam - given the dynamics of domestic politics in both
                    countries. For a detailed account of these negotiations and their results see
                    the enclosed annex, “Healing the Wound of War with North Vietnam.”</p>
                <p>Following President Nixon's re-election for a second term, an election in which
                    the promise of “peace” in Vietnam played a prominent part, John Hannah was
                    summarily dismissed as Administrator of AID. I say summarily because his
                    dismissal was without prior warning; he was told of his dismissal by telephone
                    while on holiday in Michigan. Dan Parker was appointed administrator.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was he relieved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: He was treated very shabbily, but it was never entirely clear why.
                    Apparently in his second term President Nixon decided to clear house of
                    presidential appointees who were considered either too liberal or too
                    independent, and John Hannah was both.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was fairly liberal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: John Hannah was a liberal Republican who had played a strongly
                    independent role in encouraging the Democratically controlled Congress to
                    reshape the American aid program in favor of basic human needs and earmarking
                    increasingly large sums for that purpose. That was not entirely appreciated by
                    the Nixon Administration. Other political appointees were dismissed at the same
                    time. Some characterized the period as the “night of the long knives.”</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>It was suggested that I leave the position of deputy administrator of AID in
                    favor of an ambassadorial assignment. Because of my service in the Vietnam
                    negotiations I was offered my choice of several vacant posts, including
                    ambassador to Indonesia, to the new country of Bangladesh as well as ambassador
                    to the OECD in Paris and several others. Given my career interest in
                    international development, I chose chairman of the Development Assistance
                    Committee (DAC) with the OECD in Paris - a position which up to that time had
                    been held by a succession of U.S. career ambassadors, including Ambassador
                    Riddleberger and, immediately preceding me, Ambassador Ed Martin.</p>
                <p>Chairman of the Development Assistance Committee - 1974</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During your assignment to the DAC, you were still an AID
                        employee, weren't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: The Chairman of the DAC is a unique position authorized by the U.S.
                    Congress in the foreign aid legislation; the position is imbued with
                    quasi-international status. The chairman is nominated by the U.S. Government and
                    elected by the 18 member governments of the committee who are the principal
                    donors of foreign assistance. His salary is paid by the U.S. which also provides
                    an ambassadorial residence in Paris. However, the chairman's operating expenses
                    - office, secretary, travel - are provided by the budget of the OECD.</p>
                <p>The Development Assistance Committee was set up at American initiative to
                    encourage other industrial market-economy countries to join in the
                    U.S.-sponsored common aid effort of assisting developing countries - an effort
                    reaching $60 billion in 1993.</p>
                <p>The DAC meets regularly to discuss significant issues concerning development and
                    the effectiveness of economic assistance, both by regular member representatives
                    stationed with the OECD in Paris and by ministerial heads of aid agencies and
                    their senior officials in periodic special meetings.</p>
                <p>The position of the DAC chairman is like a high-academic chair in that he reviews
                    annually the aid program of each of the OECD member countries, issues an
                    appraisal of their respective programs, and also issues an annual chairman's
                    report on the general state of development, published by the OECD on his
                    personal responsibility. The DAC Chairman's Report embodies the development
                    experience of the member countries, and the research of a highly competent OECD
                    secretariat which services the committee under the chairman's direction. The
                    annual report includes a statistical annex on the total flow of financial
                    resources to developing countries - commercial and governmental flows and
                    concessionary official development assistance (ODA) - which is a unique
                    conceptual creation of the DAC.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>I found the DAC assignment a real change of pace from the operational assignments
                    of my AID career up to that point, particularly as deputy of AID. Suddenly, I
                    had the opportunity to think deeply about foreign policy and the post-World War
                    II development experience.</p>
                <p>It was an opportune time to reflect. After two decades of high economic growth
                    for both developed and developing countries - seen in retrospect as a golden age
                    - the world economy fell into deep recession and crisis. The doubling of oil
                    prices in 1973 by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was a
                    major cause of recession. Also contributing was the near tripling of food grain
                    prices resulting from the effects of drought on grain production in the Soviet
                    Union and large areas of Asia and Africa, and the rundown of U.S. food grain
                    reserves in major transfers to the Soviet Union. At the same time, there was an
                    abrupt change in the world monetary system, away from fixed to flexible exchange
                    rates, and the unusual phenomenon of “stagflation”, which combined economic
                    stagnation and inflation.</p>
                <p>My 1974 report as DAC Chairman dealt with reappraisal of the fundamentals of
                    recent development policy. There was deep concern - which remains to this day -
                    that economic growth and the emphasis on growth had not translated well into
                    poverty reduction. Despite economic progress there were more and more poor
                    people in the world; and aid programs were not addressing that problem in any
                    direct way. At the same time, a widely popularized report of that period on the
                    “limits of growth”, predicted that natural resources would become increasingly
                    scarce, thereby raising issues of environmental constraints and resource
                    conservation. Price turbulence for both energy and food seemed to forebode basic
                    changes in the future.</p>
                <p>Something more was indicated than the development policies we had been pursuing;
                    there was a searching for alternative development approaches. The U.N. World
                    Food Conference in 1974 focused on the need to address rural development and,
                    particularly, the food needs of the poorest countries which were seriously in
                    deficit on both food and energy imports. These were seen as the “most seriously
                    affected countries” by the crisis.</p>
                <p>This raised issues of more effective assistance measures specifically addressing
                    the needs of disadvantaged countries and peoples. The focus on women as
                    disadvantaged came to the fore.</p>
                <p>It also became clear that growing disparities among developing countries called
                    for more differentiated aid policies. Economic assistance programs had been
                    dealing with the developing countries with mostly common approaches. Now there
                    was more attention to differences among developing countries. Some were making
                    great progress and were identified as NICs - newly industrializing countries.
                    Others were very seriously affected and required emergency relief and revised
                    assistance policies.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>At the same time there was increasing concern about the effect of development
                    policies on the environment, following the 1972 U.N. Environment and Development
                    Conference in Stockholm. Development assistance programs had not given much
                    consideration to environmental issues and natural resource conservation.</p>
                <p>Consequently, the development agenda had shifted to encompass a whole range of
                    new issues - in areas of emergency assistance, considerations of equity,
                    environment, differentiated approaches - calling for new policies of development
                    cooperation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Along the lines you just outlined, it was a period of
                        great ferment then. Was it also the time when basic needs was being
                        promoted?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Basic needs was not immediately to the fore; it was one of the
                    alternatives approaches that would come later.</p>
                <p>It indeed was a period of searching review and great ferment; an interesting time
                    to be at the DAC which was charged with oversight of the common aid effort. I
                    spent my first year as chairman in reappraisal calling for even further
                    appraisal of all on-going assistance programs on the grounds that we hadn't done
                    all that well. My first annual report was a survey of the new problems which had
                    emerged in the field of development and development assistance and a call for
                    greater emphasis on increasing development assistance to disadvantaged
                    countries, along with policies more closely attuned to the different developing
                    regions.</p>
                <p>Early in 1975 I was a guest of the Government of Japan for a series of speeches
                    and consultations on the importance of reappraising aid programs in the light of
                    changing circumstances. One problem with Japanese aid policy was that in
                    response to major oil price increase Japan had stepped up concessionary economic
                    aid to the oil exporting countries - in a mistaken view of assuring the security
                    of Japan's oil imports. I pointed out that this was a gross distortion of
                    priorities; it was not the oil exporters which needed more aid, but rather the
                    oil dependent low-income countries. At the encouragement of Japan Foreign
                    Ministry, I strongly urged a change of Japan's aid priorities, including a
                    substantial increase in the level of their aid.</p>
                <p>That year, with the recession in trade and high prices of oil and food imports,
                    the economic prospects of the low-income countries was bleak; emergency
                    assistance was mobilized by the United Nations to help them. This also was the
                    period of the New International Economic Order (NIEO) when, led by the OPEC
                    countries, the developing world called for structural changes in the world
                    economy in favor of assured higher returns for their commodity exports and
                    financial concessions. Developing countries as a group saw the world economic
                    system as biased against them, and they hoped to emulate the OPEC countries in
                    forcing concessions from the OECD industrial countries.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>OECD countries, for their part, were eager to engage the OPEC countries on energy
                    policy and launched an extended Paris based Conference on International Economic
                    Cooperation (CIEC) which attempted to negotiate NIEO issues with developing
                    countries over the period 1975-1977. This was the North-South Dialogue which
                    found wide agreement in principle on the need for more stable and equitable
                    international economic policies but failed to reach agreement on fundamental
                    changes for bringing this about. The results were disappointing, except for
                    agreed increases in economic assistance.</p>
                <p>DAC members raised their official development assistance from $9 billion in 1973
                    to $13.8 billion in 1975 - or from 0.29 per cent of their combined GNP to 0.35
                    per cent. As an active participant in CIEC negotiations, I was pleased with this
                    result.</p>
                <p>Also, OPEC countries launched economic assistance programs at a level averaging
                    $7 billion annually, as an expression of their solidarity with other developing
                    countries which had been hurt by the oil price increase. In an attempt to
                    coordinate the aid efforts of OPEC countries with those of the DAC members in my
                    role as DAC chairman, I visited the major OPEC donors, namely Iran, Kuwait, and
                    Saudi Arabia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Weren't the OPEC countries part of the DAC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: No, members of the DAC were the OECD market-oriented industrial
                    countries of Western Europe, the U.S., Canada and Japan - who engaged in
                    economic assistance programs to the Third World. The origin of the OECD was the
                    group of countries who worked together for the recovery of Western Europe under
                    the auspices of the U.S. sponsored Marshall Plan. With the success of West
                    European recovery, governments concerned decided to continue their cooperation
                    in a permanent Paris-based OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and
                    Development). At the same time, the U.S. engaged its OECD partners to join in a
                    common aid effort to the developing regions under the U.S.-led DAC (Development
                    Assistance Committee of the OECD).</p>
                <p>Interestingly, Japan established its credentials for membership in the OECD by
                    first launching an economic assistance program and being admitted to the
                    DAC.</p>
                <p>The OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Countries) after gaining the large financial
                    surpluses from their dramatic increases in oil prices, projected themselves as
                    leaders of the Third World Group of 77 developing countries. It was an
                    adversarial role against the OECD countries for restructuring of international
                    trade, aid and financial arrangements which would be more equitable for the
                    Third World developing countries. OPEC aid programs for non-oil low-income
                    countries were an integral aspect of OPEC leadership and were alleged, by them,
                    to be fairer and more effective that the DAC member development assistance
                    efforts. All these issues were part of the NIEO North-South dialogue and
                    negotiations of that period.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any dialogue with the OPEC countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Establishing a dialogue on the DAC experience with development aid was
                    the object of my visits to the major OPEC countries. In each case, I introduced
                    them to the DAC statistical methods for reporting on financial flows to
                    developing countries, with a major distinction between commercial flows and aid
                    - which the DAC standard defined as any financial disbursements which embodied
                    at least a 25 per cent concessionary element relative to the going commercial
                    rate of finance.</p>
                <p>I welcomed OPEC members governments as donors in the common effort for Third
                    World development, undertook to report on the levels of their aid efforts on
                    comparable terms with those of DAC members, and to exchange comparative
                    experience with them on the relative effectiveness of our respective programs.
                    In these efforts, I gained the confidence and cooperation of OPEC governments in
                    the area of development finance. In 1977, we initiated joint meetings in Paris
                    of the OPEC and DAC donors under my co-chairmanship with Minister Abdul Latef el
                    Hamid of Kuwait. The practice of annual meetings to exchange experience among
                    DAC and OPEC donors has continued to this day.</p>
                <p>My second year at the OECD was fully occupied with seemingly endless North-South
                    dialogue meetings, travel and consultations. In my third annual report as DAC
                    Chairman, I assessed this experience. While most observers at the time saw the
                    North-South dialogue as a dismal failure, I concluded that much had been gained
                    from the dialogue and reported my views under the theme “new realism in
                    North-South relations.”</p>
                <p>My thesis was that despite appearances to the contrary, there was the basis for
                    an emerging consensus from the North-South dialogue that: a) structural
                    adjustment was foremost a matter of domestic policy by the developing countries
                    themselves (rather than the NIEO's over-emphasis on external adjustment of the
                    world economy), and that b): trade and aid assistance needed to be better
                    adapted to helping the developing countries with their structural adjustment
                    initiatives. I further spelled out that the adaption of development cooperation
                    required to assist the poorest developing countries differed substantially from
                    cooperation with the rapidly advancing, newly industrializing countries
                    (NICs).</p>
                <p>There was wide interest in my analysis of the twin pillars of the “new realism” -
                    namely the primacy of domestic policy adjustment and the importance, and
                    example, provided by the development experience of the NICs. A feature of the
                    DAC Chairman's annual report on the state of development was the prospect of
                    sensing emerging trends and - by elaborating them - appearing to lead
                    development thinking. For several years I was considered to be fairly successful
                    in this role.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>My account of the “new realism” was hailed by the Government of the Federal
                    Republic of Germany. Helmut Kohl, then leader of the opposition, gave a luncheon
                    in Bonn in my honor, and I was the keynote speaker at a dinner sponsored by the
                    German foreign policy association. The report on “new realism” was translated
                    into German and Japanese, as well as the usual French and English translations
                    of OECD documents.</p>
                <p>One aspect of my analysis in that period was to point out that the rapidly
                    advancing developing countries, for the most part, gave priority to agriculture
                    - as a basis for their industrial development - and that their production of
                    food was ahead of their domestic food needs. Whereas for most of the developing
                    world, the opposite was true, the relative neglect of agriculture was leading to
                    increasing food deficits. At the United Nations World Food Conference in Rome,
                    the DAC reported on the growing dependence of developing countries on food aid,
                    and supported the importance of their increasing production of food.</p>
                <p>During 1976 John Hannah, then executive director of the U.N. World Food Council,
                    directed me to help raise the funds necessary to initiate the International Fund
                    for Agricultural Development (IFAD). Hannah had been my boss as former AID
                    Administrator and he continued to regard me in his deputy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't IFAD created by the World Food Conference?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: One of the conference resolutions agreed that there should be an IFAD.
                    However, it was left to the new World Food Council led by John Hannah to raise
                    the funds necessary to make it operational, which was agreed to require at least
                    a billion dollars, jointly funded by OPEC and DAC donors. Hannah said that he
                    was stymied by a $40 million shortfall from the agreed target; if I could raise
                    half from the DAC members, Hannah believed he could persuade OPEC donors to
                    provide the remainder.</p>
                <p>While the DAC Chairman was expected to strengthen the rationale for support of
                    development assistance programs, he was not expected to engage in operational
                    activities. However, I sent out a series of cable requests to DAC members, and
                    within two weeks had assurances of an additional $20 million. Hannah took that
                    assurance to OPEC countries who matched it, and IFAD was launched. That was an
                    unprecedented role for the DAC.</p>
                <p>My 1977 report addressed the theme of basic human needs. I emphasized that the
                    sheer scale of extreme poverty and mounting unemployment challenged social and
                    political stability in the developing world, and that it was urgent to make
                    basic needs the center-piece of development policies for assisting the
                    low-income countries. I proposed that developing countries take the lead in
                    preparing basic needs programs focusing on proposals for assuring adequate
                    nutrition, safe drinking water, population stability, primary public health
                    facilities and basic education.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>One feature of my report was the observation that United Nations agency personnel
                    over-staffed headquarter locations, and that 25 per cent of their numbers should
                    be transferred to the field to assist developing countries in implementing basic
                    human needs programs. Judith Hart, British minister for development, supported
                    the proposal, but jokingly wondered if such reassignment of U.N. staff would set
                    back field operations.</p>
                <p>Again my report was well received. USAID Administrator John Gilligan commended it
                    as “must reading” for all AID personnel. The Government of Sweden sponsored a
                    series of lectures in Stockholm on the report, including my appearance before
                    the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Swedish Parliament. The Swedes highly
                    complemented the work of the Development Assistance Committee, observing that it
                    had been instrumental in persuading the Nordic countries to join the common aid
                    effort.</p>
                <p>At about that time, Sam Adams, AID Assistant Administrator for Africa, asked me
                    to organize a consortium of aid donors to work cooperatively with the seven
                    countries of the Sahel of Africa. They had been severely afflicted by drought
                    and famine, and there was international interest in helping them rehabilitate
                    their economies as a basis for future food security. A key issue was whether the
                    African countries themselves would join together in a combined effort for
                    regional development which, in Sam's view, would increase the prospect of
                    sustained donor support.</p>
                <p>I was reluctant to take on such an operational task, one which logically should
                    be an African initiative. Sam Adams, however, was persistent in saying that the
                    African leaders had great difficulty in agreeing among themselves and that only
                    my prestige - as formerly President Nixon's coordinator for African emergency
                    relief and now DAC Chairman - could persuade African leaders of the importance
                    of a regional aid consortium.</p>
                <p>Finally I agreed that if the U.S. and French governments would jointly finance a
                    small staff in Paris for the endeavor, I would lend it my support and guidance.
                    French support was essential for I didn't wish to appear solely as a U.S. agent.
                    An office and initial operating fund was set up at the OECD; Roy Stacy was
                    assigned by AID and Ann DeLattre was seconded for France. With their assistance,
                    we developed a proposal for a Club du Sahel, as a new type of aid donor
                    consortium, with a large measure of African staffing and direction. I then
                    traveled in Africa to discuss this proposal with ministers of the Sahel.</p>
                <p>At a meeting in Niamey of the ministers of the Sahel countries I made the
                    proposal for a regional donor aid consortium. They were polite but said they
                    lacked the authority to approve such a proposal. Basically they were not
                    interested. They didn't like the idea of having to account to an organized group
                    of donors; rather they preferred to deal with the donors one by one. I was later
                    told informally that the vote against had been five to two.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you trying to get them to agree to or
                        accept?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: A consultative arrangement in which the governments of the Sahel
                    countries would join together as a group and meet with interested donors as a
                    group in a common program of drought rehabilitation and development. Our idea
                    was for a new type of donor association, not like the World Bank-led type of
                    donor-dominated consultative groups, but one in which the recipient governments
                    would be in charge of secretariat preparation and actual meetings. It was a new
                    concept at the time, one that later would be emulated by the conference of
                    countries in Southern Africa.</p>
                <p>My reply to the ministers in Niamey was that I understood that they lacked
                    authority, and that I would place the proposal before the heads of state of the
                    Sahel at their next meeting in Nouakchott, Mauritania. Fortunately, at that
                    later meeting President Senghor of Senegal was in the chair. He understood the
                    importance of a regional association of donors and fully supported it.</p>
                <p>In a private meeting President Senghor said, “Tell me precisely what you need and
                    I will see to it.” I replied: agreement for the Club du Sahel, sponsorship and
                    date for its first meeting at ministerial level, an agreed agenda and a seconded
                    African staff to begin preparations. President Senghor replied, “Fine, but you
                    must assure me that donors will also attend at ministerial level.” He gained the
                    approval of the chiefs of state, and Senegal undertook to host the first meeting
                    in Dakar.</p>
                <p>Our mission was a success; however, I was committed to persuading the DAC donors
                    to attend the inaugural meeting of the Club at ministerial level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find the donors enthusiastic about joining in
                        something like this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I started with the strong support of the U.S. and the French and I was
                    able to obtain the support of most of the European members for a meeting of the
                    DAC in Dakar. However, I had to move fast in lining up support, and I failed to
                    reach the German Minister of Development Cooperation, Egon Bahr, before he
                    issued a statement charging that I had exceeded my mandate as Chairman of the
                    DAC. I had a real problem there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why the Germans? You know that from my experience that's
                        not an unusual German attitude. Why are they so restrictive?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I believe the Germans saw a French plot to gain increased European aid
                    for an area of special French interest in Africa. The Germans at that time were
                    sensitive to increasing French influence in the European community and to
                    increasing French claims on the community's financial resources. In this sense,
                    Minister Bahr saw me as lending myself to French interests in the Sahel; there
                    may have been something in that.</p>
                <p>At any rate, the Club du Sahel was launched in Dakar, most of the DAC ministers
                    and heads of aid agencies did attend, and the meeting was successful. While the
                    Germans did not attend the meeting in Dakar, they quietly lent their support at
                    a later date. And the Club became something of an innovative model of
                    recipient-donor collaboration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was something of a new initiative too, meeting on the
                        turf of a developing country rather than in Paris or Geneva?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: It was quite a departure from normal practice; on the whole I believe
                    the DAC members liked it. It was a period when developed country governments
                    were pleased to show at least modest flexibility in North-South relations.</p>
                <p>At that meeting in Dakar, government representatives wanted to make me head of
                    the secretariat for the group. Of course I declined since that would conflict
                    with my responsibilities as DAC Chairman. I proposed Ann DeLattre who became a
                    permanent executive secretary at least on the donor side. Both Ann DeLattre and
                    Roy Stacy were dedicated to the concept of regional cooperation and to a new
                    approach to development cooperation. Their work with the Club du Sahel has been
                    outstanding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was this first meeting? What was the core of the
                        agenda? What were you trying to get, agreement to an organization or was
                        there a program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: There was a program of priorities as well as the setting up of an
                    organization with a permanent secretariat. And there was the commitment of the
                    donors to support rehabilitation of agricultural production and food security
                    measures, beyond emergency relief. What was agreed was measures for a stepped up
                    development effort on the basis of enhanced regional cooperation among the Sahel
                    countries. At the same time, it was recognized that the Sahel member countries
                    did not constitute a natural regional economy; one had to look to inclusion of
                    the coastal states for true broader regional planning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't see it as a natural economic region?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: While there were limited complementarities among their economies, they
                    had many problems in common and there were advantages to their working together
                    for mutual support and exchange of experience. Also, as small economies, there
                    were some efficiencies in a commonality of effort, and in working together to
                    mobilize sustained donor support. While initially skeptical, the Sahel
                    governments became enthusiastic supporters of the consortium approach.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were the prime leaders on the African side? You
                        mentioned President Senghor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: The prime movers were the chiefs of state, and President Senghor
                    remained active in that regard. The Sahel ministers of the Club continued to
                    meet annually. In the intervening periods, there were many expert meetings. In
                    the longer term, the Sahel countries did achieve modest improvements in social
                    and economic development; most outstanding, however, were their cooperative
                    measures for improved food security in the face of a harsh climate.</p>
                <p>In 1978, my last year and fifth report as Chairman of the DAC, I reviewed the
                    changing pattern of capital flows to developing countries. Whereas in 1973
                    official aid had been the dominant element, by 1977 private capital flows
                    exceeded official flows of capital by a ration of two to one.</p>
                <p>I also observed that despite large liquidity of capital in the world financial
                    markets, much of it was not being as productively utilized as one might have
                    expected. There was excessive borrowing by many developing countries for
                    non-productive consumption, and massive amounts of capital remained under
                    utilized.</p>
                <p>My report strongly urged that developing countries cease to postpone essential
                    domestic structural adjustment by excessive borrowing. And that, at the same
                    time, there should be stepped up programs for basic investments in the Third
                    World in areas of energy, food, raw materials and related infrastructure. By
                    putting stress on more productive investment of the then massive under-utilized
                    savings, I concluded that it would be possible to ensure more adequate global
                    production in areas critical to balanced future economic growth.</p>
                <p>There was interest in these conclusions among OECD countries, and the report was
                    endorsed by the OECD Council of Ministers. But the application of the report's
                    recommendations were generally honored in the breech.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>On my watch as DAC Chairman, official development assistance (ODA) had increased
                    by 15 per cent annually to a level of $20 billion in 1978. The terms of aid also
                    had improved to reach an overall grant element of 87 per cent. And efforts which
                    I supported to increase assistance through multilateral agencies had been
                    successful. Multilateral aid reached its highest level of 31.7 per cent in 1978
                    as a proportion of total aid. (The proportion of multilateral aid has since
                    declined to below 20 per cent.)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were these multilateral organizations part of the DAC or
                        involved ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: The Bank and the International Monetary Fund were observers and their
                    representatives always attended DAC meetings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The regional banks were not observers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: The regional banks were not formally associated with the DAC. However,
                    as Chairman I hosted informal annual meetings which brought together heads of
                    international agencies with DAC ministers. These are known as Tidewater meetings
                    because the first meeting was held in Tidewater, Maryland. It was initiated by
                    Ambassador Ed Martin, my predecessor at the DAC, and I continued the
                    tradition.</p>
                <p>Tidewater meetings were hosted by different DAC member governments, and provided
                    an opportunity for off the record discussions with the Presidents of the World
                    Bank and IMF and senior U.N. officials. Bob McNamara valued these contacts
                    highly since his contacts at the World Bank were mostly with finance rather than
                    development ministers. I generally had lunch with McNamara whenever I was in
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>One innovation which I introduced, and I did it over the objection of some of the
                    Tidewater participants, was to include Third World leaders at the meetings. In
                    this way Tidewater became a consultation of not only heads of bilateral and
                    multilateral agencies but with representatives of developing countries as
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were some of the people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Generally, leaders who were recognized spokes- persons for the Third
                    World, such as Julius Nyerere, Gamini Corea then head of UNCTAD, I.G. Patel from
                    UNDP and usually several prominent ministers from individual developing
                    countries.</p>
                <p>That gave the informal consultations an added North-South dimension. That
                    practice has continued to this day.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was there resistance of the DAC members to having a
                        direct dialogue with the developing countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Mainly it was Bob McNamara who objected that it was going the diminish
                    the value of the meetings. He may have been concerned that so much of the
                    North-South dialogue of the period was rather sterile in terms of candor and
                    fresh thinking. Also, in this work at the Bank, McNamara didn't lack contact
                    with developing country representatives, whereas he really valued the exchange
                    with senior officials of other development agencies.</p>
                <p>The first of these new style Tidewater meetings was hosted in Norway and the
                    Third World participants immediately sensed the spirit of the Tidewater
                    informality; all agreed it went well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember any of the major issues that came forward
                        at some of the session? Were there formal papers or a report from these
                        meetings or was it kept very informal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I would propose a very brief tentative agenda which usually highlighted
                    one or two issues from my annual chairman's report, and might also include
                    suggestions by the host country government. Aside from that there were no formal
                    papers presented, nor was there any record of the meetings as such. I might
                    later circulate a brief note on an issue which seemed to point toward a
                    consensus, but this was rare and not really expected. The value of the meetings
                    were that they were off the record.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they were candid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: We generally met on a weekend and participants were entirely candid, no
                    posturing or statements for the record. There were many problems related to
                    development and it was a period of reappraisal and ferment. These informal
                    meetings were considered by the participants to be quite valuable.</p>
                <p>I also changed somewhat the structure of the annual meetings of DAC ministers and
                    heads of AID agencies by hosting an informal breakfast among them before we got
                    into the formal sessions with the papers prepared by the secretariat. Sometimes
                    the informal meeting would last all morning. The staffs resented that I had
                    captured their ministers, but ministers were delighted because they were free to
                    exchange views with each other off the record and without the necessity to
                    deliver immediately their prepared speeches.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>These were among the innovations I launched as DAC Chairman: the funding of IFAD,
                    the club du Sahel as a new donor consultative group, and means for consultation
                    among ministers and senior officials both at Tidewater and in the DAC.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there other opportunities where the DAC met with
                        developing countries other than Tidewater?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I also introduced the process of inviting developing country officials
                    to attend some of the DAC specialized working sessions. There was reluctance
                    among DAC members to accept this procedure, but I insisted on it. We treated the
                    developing country representatives as consultants and it greatly increased the
                    value of the meetings.</p>
                <p>I also proposed in my last report that for the annual review of each of the DAC
                    member aid programs there should be three reviewers - the two normal peer
                    members of the DAC plus a select development country representative. The draft
                    of the chairman's report then went to all members of the DAC for comments.
                    Normally these comments were narrowly addressed to questions of fact and
                    interpretations of individual DAC member performance, changes that could be
                    readily accommodated. The draft report would then be nominally approved by the
                    OECD Council of Ambassadors. The DAC Chairman was given great leeway to express
                    his personal views, although he was on a short leash, so to speak, since he was
                    subject to annual election. This, however, was my final report.</p>
                <p>The DAC Chairman's report traditionally has been issued on his personal authority
                    and that has been respected. However, in this case the proposal for developing
                    country representation in the review of DAC member programs was so strongly
                    opposed as changing fundamentally the nature of the DAC, that although it was my
                    personal report, and my prerogative as Chairman, I did not want to stand firm on
                    a recommendation that clearly would not be implemented, so I took it out. The
                    DAC was not ready to accept Third World review of the members' aid programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or to meet with the DAC except in working groups? And most
                        of the donors were resistant to go any further than that in any interactive
                        way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Acceptance of developing country participants in working groups on
                    specialized subjects on which they were consulted did not alter the structure of
                    the DAC or its working relations among members. However, to include such Third
                    World participation in peer review of DAC member programs would have been a
                    truly major change.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>The successive reviews of each DAC member's assistance program by two peer member
                    countries - under the review of the DAC Chairman - is a well established process
                    which is taken quite seriously, a process of peer review originating from the
                    early experience of Marshall Plan assistance. Each member was expected to submit
                    to a fully candid - no holds barred - critical review of its peers. The
                    conclusion of these reviews would be on two levels: a press report balancing
                    praise with encouragement for improvement, and a classified report which was
                    more trenchant in identifying program weaknesses. The latter I would prepare,
                    along with my own views as chairman, and send to the government of the reviewed
                    country.</p>
                <p>The DAC review process and exchange of experience was highly valued by member
                    governments. I was often called upon to explain review conclusions. For
                    instance, in Stockholm, when the Foreign Relations Committee of their parliament
                    sought an exchange with me. Once the Swiss Ambassador called to assure me that a
                    program weakness revealed by the review was being corrected. The Japanese were
                    particularly sensitive to the reviews.</p>
                <p>The DAC reviews were taken seriously everywhere except in the United States. I
                    don't mean that it was without influence in the U.S., but it didn't have the
                    same weight that it had with the European donors and with Japan. When my DAC
                    report on basic needs came out AID Administrator Gilligan circulated it widely
                    as recommended reading. So the DAC had influence within the development
                    community but it was not taken seriously by congressional politicians. Maybe
                    that was expecting too much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is interesting. There are some views that have been
                        expressed, particularly after the initial period of the DAC when the U.S.
                        was getting other donors involved - perhaps this was after your time - that
                        the DAC was becoming less useful, less effective, or sterile in its
                        operations. Is that your view?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: The DAC may be less effective than it was earlier; nor is official aid
                    as important as it had been. Perhaps the U.S. should have rotated the chairman's
                    position rather than insisting it always be an American. Initially that made
                    sense given the dominant U.S. role and experience in development assistance.
                    Later other DAC members were willing to step forward and give leadership to the
                    DAC, the Germans and Japanese, but they got little encouragement from us.</p>
                <p>In the early 1950s and 1960s the DAC played an important role in mobilizing
                    development assistance. Ambassador Riddleberger was the first DAC Chairman. As a
                    career Ambassador he made an outstanding contribution by engaging the European
                    countries and Japan; as their economies recovered they joined the common aid
                    effort. For several decades we continued to urge increased aid, our own and
                    others. Recently, as American interest flagged the concern of other DAC members
                    has been to sustain U.S. engagement in the common aid effort.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>I was the first DAC Chairman with field experience in development assistance
                    coming from AID; that period of the 1970s was one of reappraisal and governments
                    looked to the DAC for guidance on new directions. My successors, John Lewis and
                    following him Rud Poats, brought tremendous development experience and prestige
                    to the DAC, providing outstanding leadership on implementation of redirected aid
                    policies and programs. If the role of the DAC has waned in influence, it must
                    have occurred in the recent 1990s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that the DAC was an opportunity for the U.S.
                        to influence the programs of other donors, and that they considered what
                        they learned from the AID experience in development to be valuable?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Yes, definitely. The DAC was a transmission belt for American aid
                    experience, which in the early years was preeminent. AID ran large programs in
                    the developing world and its experience was both varied and extensive.
                    Consequently, what we had to offer in terms of advice and case studies of
                    country experience was considered by members of the DAC to be important. In a
                    sense, the DAC acted as a quasi-independent agent for the extension of American
                    aid policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now there is a question whether the need for something
                        like the DAC is as critical as it was in the earlier period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: When the USAID was dominant in development assistance and a major
                    innovator of new ideas and approaches, its leadership contributed to making the
                    DAC a significant institution. In the current period, multilateral agencies, and
                    particularly the World Bank and UNDP, have become the dynamic leaders in the
                    development field. Also, private sector agencies - service and commercial - have
                    become increasingly important in the transmission of development services,
                    technology and capital. We are in an entirely new situation calling for
                    different approaches and instruments.</p>
                <p>Director of the United Nations World Food Council: 1978-1985</p>
                <p>While I was in Paris with the OECD, John Hannah came for a visit, spending an
                    overnight with us. His message to me was that I should replace him in Rome as
                    Director of the World Food Council. My initial response was negative, pointing
                    out that I was not an agriculturalist. Hannah had spent his life in agricultural
                    extension and education; as president of Michigan State, he had transformed it
                    from a small agricultural college into a major university. He said my lack of
                    direct agricultural experience wasn't as important as my background in
                    development, and suggested I sleep on his proposal.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>The next morning at breakfast, Hannah said, “Maury I want you to take this job,
                    are you going to do it or not?” I reflected that senior positions at the U.N.
                    are not easy to come by, often involving fierce competition among potential
                    candidates. In this case, there already were two outstanding contenders for
                    executive director, the British secretary of agriculture and a Bangladesh leader
                    of the Group of 77 at FAO in Rome. Finally, believing it was a remote
                    possibility, I said, “All right, if offered, I will accept,”</p>
                <p>A month later I had the job as executive director of the ministerial U.N. World
                    Food Council (WFC) with the rank of assistant secretary-general. I had been
                    proposed by the U.S. to Secretary-General Waldheim who, in turn, directed an
                    election of prospective candidates by the 36 member governments of the Council.
                    The result was my election and appointment with Salahuddin Ahmad, the
                    Bangladeshi who came in second, appointed as my deputy. The votes were
                    two-to-one in my favor.</p>
                <p>We moved from Paris to Rome and I began to direct the Council's small secretariat
                    of about 18 persons in preparation for its forthcoming meeting in Ottawa,
                    Canada. Our offices were located in one of the FAO buildings. The World Food
                    Council had been set up by action of the U.N. General Assembly on the
                    recommendation of the 1974 U.N. World Food Conference.</p>
                <p>An independent World Food Council reporting to the General Assembly had been
                    bitterly opposed by FAO, which as a fall-back position had insisted that the
                    Council secretariat should be physically housed in Rome, in FAO. There was
                    residual bitterness on the part of many of FAO's one thousand professional
                    personnel in Rome (FAO's field staff was about 2,000) - and particularly by the
                    FAO Director-General - who believed the Council should never have been set-up;
                    the rivalry between the WFC and FAO was fierce.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the reason for having a World Food Council as
                        separate from FAO? Why was this so critical?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Interestingly, insistence on a ministerial world food council,
                    independent of FAO, had been by the developing country governments. Major
                    governments like Algeria and Brazil were the prime movers for an independent
                    council at the World Food Conference. At that time, it was widely believed that
                    the world was entering a period of major food shortages. There had been several
                    years of widespread drought, world food reserves were at dangerously low levels,
                    food aid had been based on surpluses which no longer existed, and food grain
                    prices had tripled. Food deficit developing countries were severely affected and
                    fearful of the future. In this situation it was believed that the world's
                    institutions for dealing with food problems needed strengthening.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>There was a lack of confidence that FAO - bound to narrow technical work - was up
                    to dealing with these problems. FAO was seen as overly bureaucratic and weak in
                    policy analysis. The mandate of the World Food Council secretariat - which I now
                    headed - was to provide overall policy analysis and guidance to FAO and the
                    other development assistance agencies. There was no doubt that this represented
                    a black eye for FAO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were the members, the ministers of agriculture of the
                        OECD countries or of all countries? What was it able to accomplish?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Since the World Food Council was an organ of the U.N. General Assembly
                    it was concerned with the food policy and problems of all countries.</p>
                <p>Membership on the Council, however, was limited to 36 countries on a regional
                    constituency basis. There were nine African seats, eight Asian, seven Latin
                    American, four for the communist countries, and eight for Europe and North
                    America. Countries were elected to the Council by the U.N. General Assembly on a
                    rotating basis, except that the U.S. and Soviet Union were accorded permanent
                    seats, although without veto power.</p>
                <p>Representation was mainly by ministers of agriculture, although ministers of
                    development cooperation also supported the World Food Council and the United
                    Kingdom was consistently represented by its development minister. It was the
                    interest and support of the development assistance agencies - bilateral and
                    multilateral - which made it possible for the WFC's secretariat to be reasonably
                    effective. The development agencies regularly provided additional financing and
                    seconded personnel to assist the WFC. Certainly my background as a former DAC
                    Chairman and my extensive contacts in the development community was helpful.</p>
                <p>The WFC was conceived as a world food security council, and we adopted a broad
                    and all-embracing concept of food security as the primary focus for the
                    Council's work. FAO conceptually had defined world food security in the narrow
                    technical terms of national food grain stocks - and, globally, as a proportion
                    of available stocks to world market demand. The World Food Council in its 1980
                    meeting broadened the concept to include not only adequate stocks of food, but
                    assets, entitlements and earning activities for people to meet their basic food
                    needs.</p>
                <p>Thus, additional to expanding food production, equal attention was required on
                    the demand side to ensure acceptable consumption levels for the poor and
                    undernourished. The means proposed by the WFC to realize this goal was national
                    food sector strategies which became the focus of major advocacy and
                    consultations with developing countries by the Council.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>These food sector strategies differed significantly from conventional planning
                    for agricultural development by integrating food production, food security, and
                    adequate consumption and nutrition. Simply stated a national food strategy or
                    policy must tackle the crucial problem of improved incentives to increase
                    production of food crops in ways which protect the access of consumers and
                    broadly expand their effective demand for food on an integrated basis.</p>
                <p>While this approach to food security is now conventional wisdom in the
                    development community, it was a conceptual innovation and breakthrough in the
                    1980s. The World Food Council mobilized development assistance agencies in
                    support of the efforts of developing countries in the formulation of food
                    policies and strategies. Resources for investment in food and agriculture
                    doubled in the decade following the World Food Conference.</p>
                <p>The World Food Council by its example and the stimulus which it provided can also
                    be said to have contributed to a revitalization of the work of FAO. This was an
                    important accomplishment, for it is seldom that a small policy staff can change
                    the direction of large and deeply entrenched institutions. Working together FAO
                    and the World Food Council strengthened a number of emergency arrangements, both
                    to meet emergencies and to attempt to bridge the gap between immediate needs and
                    the realization of more self-reliant food production in developing
                    countries.</p>
                <p>My message during my seven years with the World Food Council was that “food and a
                    sound rural economy are essential for development”, and that over-emphasis on
                    industry to the neglect of agriculture has adverse effect on the development
                    progress. It was a message which I spread widely in speeches, conferences and
                    publications. Most of the countries of Asia and Latin America have adopted this
                    approach and shifted their development priorities accordingly. Most African
                    countries have been slow to make the transition and continue the strong
                    anti-development capital and urban bias in their national policies.</p>
                <p>In retirement since 1985, I have continued to speak and write on issues of
                    development policy in studies for the United Nations, for the Washington-based
                    Overseas Development Council (ODC) as a senior-associate, and former president
                    of the Society for International Development (SID). Recently, I teach and
                    provide guidance on international development to students as a member of the

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lets pause now and take the really long view. You have
                        been involved in the development business for many years, almost from the
                        beginning, with development strategies, development policies, and so on.
                        Some people would argue that development assistance hasn't really done any
                        good. Do you see any results from what we spent this money on? Is the world
                        a better place because of foreign assistance, and how would you put that in
                        more concrete terms? Or has it not met the problems, because we still have
                        all these big problems, more poor, more of this, more of that? How would you
                        perceive U.S. foreign assistance and the AID role in terms of its long-term
                        impact on world development?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: As the dismantling of the colonial empires of our European allies
                    proceeded in the 1950s and 1960s, there was no practical alternative to
                    providing technical and economic assistance to the newly independent countries.
                    How else could an advanced country like the U.S. have established meaningful
                    diplomatic relations with them without expanding their opportunities for
                    self-betterment and advancement. Recall also that the U.S. actively urged
                    decolonization.</p>
                <p>However, the task of accelerating development of countries with traditional
                    societies and values was far more difficult than reconstruction of the economies
                    of war shattered industrial countries like those of Western Europe and Japan as
                    we soon came to realize.</p>
                <p>Foreign aid for social and economic advancement of less developed countries is a
                    difficult instrument in application. Unless it is applied in the context of
                    building self-reliance, and firmly insisting on the reforms that make progress
                    toward self-reliance possible, foreign aid easily slips into building-in
                    dependency, which overtime can be exceeding counter-productive.</p>
                <p>There is no doubt that the Cold War competition with the Soviet Union, and the
                    challenge which communism posed as an alternative system of development, had a
                    distorting effect on U.S. foreign aid objectives and practices. The use of
                    foreign aid for short-term political objectives has a different dynamic from the
                    application of aid for self-reliant development. When U.S. objectives were
                    narrowly political, encouraging dependency was of less immediate concern, and in
                    some cases even seemed desirable. For example, we don't seem to mind continuing
                    Egyptian dependence on large-scale American foreign aid, however disadvantageous
                    that may be for Egyptian economic development.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>The large-scale foreign aid programs of the 1960s for building alliances, and the
                    containment of the Soviet Bloc, sought to mix both short term political
                    advantage with longer-term development objectives. For a time we convinced
                    ourselves that we could have it both ways. However, the use of single
                    instruments for diverse multiple purposes creates confusion and seldom works
                    well. An important advance in the use of foreign aid was made in the 1970s by
                    clarification of U.S. foreign aid policy objectives with adoption of separate
                    components for support of political purposes distinct from essentially
                    development objectives. That bifurcation continues to this day. Evaluation of
                    returns on the use of foreign aid for political advantage is nearly impossible,
                    being subjective for the U.S. policy officials involved. It would be easy in
                    such cases to suspect wasted resources.</p>
                <p>These things being said, the world clearly is a better place as a result of the
                    development programs of the U.S. and its allies in the common foreign aid
                    effort. Important has been the expression of solidarity with the low-income
                    countries in helping with measures for addressing extreme poverty. One has only
                    to recall how few educated people there were in African countries at the time of
                    their independence. It was in areas of education and health programs that
                    foreign aid made its most significant contribution. A whole generation of
                    leaders have been trained, both for government and in the private sector, along
                    with a tremendous transfer of specialized sectoral skills resulting from the
                    combined donor aid programs.</p>
                <p>Conditions in developing countries have greatly improved; advancement in
                    education, health and nutrition is a political fundamental. What people want for
                    their children is better education and health. Where we were able to help
                    countries that were determined to help themselves, foreign aid has been
                    immensely successful. That applies to most of the Asian countries and a number
                    in Latin America. Where objectives have been confused and policies inconsistent,
                    by either donors or recipients, the returns have been less dramatic.</p>
                <p>Despite uneven economic growth of the last decade or so, the developing world has
                    experienced continuous improvement in the quality of life of its people, for
                    example, even in sub-Saharan Africa taken as a whole, life expectancy has
                    advanced from 46 to 51 years and infant mortality has declined by one-fifth
                    during the 1980s. This does not give cause for complacency since levels are
                    still very low, and with improved growth, much more could be accomplished. But
                    it does indicate how little it would take to make a big difference. Sorting out
                    the problems of the poorest requires more time and more consistent efforts,
                    including dealing with issues of population increase and environmental
                    problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Have you perceived that AID and its role in foreign
                        assistance has been something of a pioneer in identifying major development
                        issues? Where would you see that as being most significant?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I believe we were the pioneers in that many of the issues discussed
                    above, and that these and related questions of performance, were brought to the
                    fore directly by the experience of the American foreign assistance programs. The
                    emphasis on self-motivated reforms in relation to self-reliant economic
                    progress, the role of women in development, the critical importance of human
                    resource development in education and health and nutrition - these were all
                    early and central features of AID programs and that experience remains valid for
                    future development.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also population and environment I support?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: We were among the pioneers in population work, although we backed away
                    from it during the Reagan period. It is still somewhat controversial in our
                    domestic arena among people who call themselves the moral majority.</p>
                <p>We have been slow to come to grips with environmental issues, as were most of the
                    development assistance agencies. The world is still struggling to define the
                    nature of environmental threats and what sustainable environmental development
                    means in operational terms for the future.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you sum up the priorities and issues that the
                        development system needs to confront in the coming decade?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I believe that large transfers of public capital assistance are coming
                    to an end; they have served their term. We began aid programs for the developing
                    world in the mid-1950s under the principle “Do not use public funds when private
                    funds can do the job.” We got diverted from that principle during the Cold War
                    into using state instruments for development in competition with the communist
                    countries. We are still working out the most effective use of private sector
                    instruments for providing development services, technology and capital.</p>
                <p>At the same time, the development assistance agenda has broadened to include a
                    reemphasis on issues of human rights, social and economic, as well as civil. And
                    women's rights are fundamental to human rights as well as to social and economic
                    development. Good governance issues are now much more openly to the fore than
                    had been thought possible earlier. Self-conditionality by developing country
                    governments for reforms and structural adjustment remain core issues. All of
                    these require carefully nuance forms of assistance collaboration among
                    developing countries and those that seek to help them.</p>
                <p>Many of the critical problems today in environment, proliferation of weapons of
                    mass destruction, emigration and population management can only be effectively
                    dealt with in a multilateral context with cooperative efforts among nations.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>Increasingly we see the need for more effective governance in parallel with the
                    development of a more vigorous civil society of concerned citizenry, both
                    nationally and globally. We are in a transitional period. Aid will still be
                    important but in a new multilateral context of common problem solving and
                    cooperative action.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Great. That is very interesting and an excellent
                        recitation of your experience.</hi>

                <p>Healing the Wounds of War with North VietnamFirst the Big Stick, Then the Big
                    Carrot</p>
                <p>On my return on January 6, 1973 from Managua where I directed U.S. emergency
                    assistance after the devastating earthquake, I met with President Nixon and
                    briefed the White House Press Corp on the American relief effort. The White
                    House was seeking to focus public attention on the President's humanitarian
                    concern for the disaster stricken people of Managua at a time when the U.S. Air
                    Force was engaged in the massive bombing of Hanoi.</p>
                <p>The Christmas bombing of Hanoi had followed closely Henry Kissinger's assurance
                    to the American people that “peace was at hand in Vietnam”, an announcement
                    which was believed to have been a significant factor in Nixon's reelection that
                    November. With the ensuing escalation of the Vietnam War, the American public
                    was understandably confused, the “peaceniks” were outraged, and the White House
                    Press Corp was adamantly seeking answers on our Vietnam policy. What they got
                    that day instead was me explaining our efforts for emergency relief in
                    Nicaragua. The Press Corp definitely was not waiting to hear more about Managua
                    and their reaction when I appeared in the briefing room was one of disbelief, it
                    not outright hostility.</p>
                <p>The meeting with President Nixon - just prior to my facing the press - was
                    intended as a photo opportunity with the President reading my report while I sat
                    facing him. The photo made the front page of the Washington Times under the
                    caption “Going Like Sixty”, for it was the President's sixtieth birthday.</p>
                <p>Nixon was in a deeply pensive mood; Managua did not seem to be much on his mind.
                    My only comment was to compliment the U.S. Mission in Nicaragua—Embassy, AID,
                    the military—for their outstanding performance in response to the disaster.
                    Nixon replied that personnel abroad seldom received recognition for their
                    service. I later learned that the Ambassador and his staff in Nicaragua were
                    awarded a Presidential medal for their performance during the earthquake.</p>
                <p>Several weeks later the press finally got a major news break with the signing on
                    January 27, 1973 of the “Paris Agreement on Ending the War and Restoring Peace
                    in Vietnam.”</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>Along with the dramatic announcement of the impending withdrawal of American
                    military forces was the declared intention of the U.S. Government to provide
                    economic assistance to North Vietnam to “heal the wounds of war.” It was
                    announced that a Joint Economic Commission was to be set up between the U.S. and
                    the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) to recommend a program of economic
                    assistance.</p>
                <p>Since the Administration was under Congressional pressure to reduce foreign aid,
                    the bureaucratic assumption was that a multilateral effort led by the World Bank
                    would be in order. The World Bank circulated a paper which estimated that
                    reconstruction of North Vietnam would require a five year program of external
                    aid averaging $570 million to $630 million annually, directed first to emergency
                    aid and then to reconstruction and development. The Bank assumed that the U.S.
                    and Japan would be the principal donors with perhaps ten other countries
                    participating. The Bank was ready to mount a Bank Mission to Hanoi on two weeks
                    notice. (U.S. economic supporting assistance to South Vietnam in 1972 was $627
                    million.)</p>
                <p>As I was leaving to review initial reconstruction efforts in Managua, Henry
                    Kissinger asked me to consider how an aid program for North Vietnam might be
                    structured. While inspecting housing projects and discussing aid requirements in
                    Nicaragua, my thought were on the shape of a USAID program for North
                    Vietnam.</p>
                <p>From Managua I went to Costa Rica to attend a SID Conference on Development
                    hosted by Oscar Arias, then Minister of Economic Planning. The conference was
                    held in the baroque opera house which is the pride and civic center of the San
                    Jose. My friend Paul Marc Henre was SID President and Barbara Ward - the
                    Honorary Chair of the Society - delivered the keynote address. It was her last
                    major public appearance before dying of cancer.</p>
                <p>From San Jose I dispatched a cable to Henry Kissinger. In ten paragraphs I
                    outlined Terms of Reference for the proposed U.S.-North Vietnam Economic
                    Commission. The program should seek to redirect the resources of the DRV to meet
                    the immediate needs of its people, to turn the economy to peaceful ends, to
                    phase U.S. assistance to DRV performance on cease fire obligations, to be
                    self-enforcing with minimum external supervision, and to maximize American
                    public understanding and Congressional support. It also should be susceptible to
                    fitting into a multilateral framework to encourage aid from other countries.</p>
                <p>On returning to Washington I learned that I had been designated to head the U.S.
                    Office of the DRV-U.S. Joint Economic Commission in Paris. The Commission would
                    have the status of a separate diplomatic entity, would be expected to meet
                    regularly, and its decisions based on unanimity between its Vietnamese and U.S.
                    Heads would be in the form of recommendation to their respective governments.
                    The first meeting was scheduled for March 15, 1973.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>My initial briefing was by Kissinger who said I should envision a USAID program
                    for North Vietnam of up to $4.75 billion over five years, which should be
                    technically feasible and subject to full presentation and accountability to the
                    Congress. Most importantly, it should be designed to assure Vietnamese
                    compliance with the Peace Accords.</p>
                <p>“You have got to be kidding!” I said, expressing my disbelief that a program of
                    that size would be feasible and acceptable to the American public and Congress.
                    Kissinger's reaction was immediately to arrange for me to see Nixon so that I
                    could “get the word directly from the President.”</p>
                <p>In a private meeting Nixon told me that the offer of American aid for healing the
                    wounds of war under Article 21 of the Paris Peace Accord had been essential to
                    obtain agreement for disengagement of American forces and release of American
                    prisoners of war held in Hanoi. He pointed out that it was traditional to secure
                    peace by helping with the reconstruction of former enemy states as we had with
                    Germany and Japan. Also, it was American policy, first announced by President
                    Johnson, that as part of a peace settlement, the U.S. would contribute to
                    reconstruction for Indochina.</p>
                <p>The President called me “the Herbert Hoover of our time”, referring to Hoover's
                    role in the reconstruction of Europe after the 1914-1918 war. Nixon said that he
                    had consulted with key Congressional leaders and believed they would support aid
                    to North Vietnam if it contributed to peace. I assured the President I would do
                    my best.</p>
                <p>As I left the White House, my reflection was that the Christmas bombing of Hanoi
                    was the “big stick” and the offer of massive aid the “big carrot” which,
                    together, had brought the leaders of North Vietnam to accept the Paris Accords.
                    Even so, information from the Soviets implied that the DRV Central Party
                    Committee had divided on the issue of ending hostilities and that the decision
                    to accept the Peace Accords had been adopted by only a narrow margin.</p>
                <p>President Nixon's offer to extend grant aid to “contribute to post-war
                    reconstruction in North Vietnam without any political conditions”, in line with
                    Article 21 of the Paris Accords, was made in a February 1, 1973 letter to Prime
                    Minister Pham Van Dong. The Nixon letter proposed $3.25 billion in grant aid and
                    “the establishment of a Joint Economic Commission to develop programs for the
                    U.S. contribution to reconstruction.” That offer was further sweetened by an
                    addendum which stated that “other forms” of U.S. aid on a reimbursable basis
                    “could fall in the range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion depending on food and
                    other commodity needs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam”.</p>
                <p>A second addendum to President Nixon's letter of February 1 stated that the
                    recommendations of the Joint Economic Commission “will be implemented by each
                    member in accordance with its constitutional provisions”.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>While the general undertaking by the U.S. to provide aid for reconstruction was
                    part of the widely publicized Paris Accords under Article 21, the exchange of
                    letters by President Nixon and the DRV Prime minister—and the levels of aid
                    specified—was a closely held secret by the Administration, kept form both the
                    public and Congress.</p>
                <p>Following my meeting with the President, there was a succession of intensive
                    briefings preliminary to my departure for Paris:</p>
                <p>—CIA study of the North Vietnam's economy and trade pattern concluded that the
                    absorptive capacity for external aid was on the order of $2.5 billion over a
                    five year period.</p>
                <p>—Secretary of State William Rogers observed “there would be one hell of a fight
                    on the Hill” over aid to North Vietnam. He believed a multilateral consortium
                    led by the World Bank would be essential with Japan in a prominent role. State
                    would handle the liaison with the Japanese, he said. Rogers gave me a pre-game
                    style pep talk —”we're in this together and we will see it through shoulder
                    -to-shoulder.” He asked me to keep him informed on the progress of the
                    negotiations by regular cable reports.</p>
                <p>—William Casey, then State Under-Secretary for Economic Affairs, understood the
                    importance of bilateral aid for maximum U.S. influence. He correctly predicted
                    that my problem would be to gain some measure of verification for an essentially
                    commodity import program. Casey observed that I would find myself in a
                    “politically dangerous position” when it came to presenting a request for aid to
                    the Congress, and warned, “Be careful Maury”. Williams Casey would later visit
                    me in Paris for a personal reading on the progress of the negotiations.</p>
                <p>—Ambassador William Sullivan—who had worked directly with Kissinger in the
                    negotiations—briefed me on the means of direct “back channel” reporting to the
                    While House, on the North Vietnamese style of negotiation, and on staff support
                    in Paris. He said that so far in the negotiations “no role for the World Bank
                    had been specified”. He believed that what was called for was “U.S. source aid
                    with acceptable means of follow-up.” Sullivan was in high spirits and may have
                    been relieved that it was I rather than he who had the task of working out the
                    aid package with the North Vietnamese.</p>
                <p>Robert MacNamara, then President of the World Bank, did not seem particularly
                    eager to engage the Bank in the reconstruction effort. His main concern at that
                    time was U.S. support of additional funds for IDA, the Bank's soft loan window.
                    In any case, he observed, “As a small country of 20 million people, North
                    Vietnam was not likely to require much aid”.</p>
                <p>Elliot Richardson, then Secretary of Defense, believed that economic aid for
                    North Vietnam would only be possible to the extent that it could be shown as
                    coming from savings in reduced U.S. military operations.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>Henry Kissinger, in a final meeting on March 14 was in a jocular mood. He said I
                    would now pay for “my sin of having been so pro-aid to India”. (Referring to my
                    earlier role in the Johnson Administration of having defended aid to India.)</p>
                <p>Kissinger spoke of “what we do and don't care about in these negotiations”. The
                    emphasis should be on a humanitarian obligation and the aid model should
                    de-emphasize the presence and number of U.S. technicians. Our political
                    objective was Vietnamese performance on the Accords. On multilateral and
                    bilateral aid language, he advised me to respond with vagueness and minimize
                    thoughts of any intrusive U.S. presence.</p>
                <p>On tactics and timing he said “leveling with them” was to be avoided—it never
                    works since they only take “what's offered and then reach for more.” He advised
                    me to be “blunt and firm and friendly and sit it out until they move”. Kissinger
                    said that Bob Mossler - who would join me in the Paris - had a different
                    approach as AID Director in South Vietnam; he would level with the South
                    Vietnamese, but that approach would not work with the North Vietnamese.</p>
                <p>Kissinger went on to say that despite difficulties, he believed we were in “a
                    hopeful position”. Initial sounding on the Hill indicated that aid may be
                    possible if two conditions were met, namely release of American prisoners and a
                    cease fire and withdrawal of North Vietnamese troops from Laos and Cambodia.</p>
                <p>As to “philosophy for work” Kissinger advised, “Get their requirements for
                    reconstruction and go over them in detail, project by project. This will take
                    time and may take you to Hanoi”. The level of U.S. aid proposed by an exchange
                    of letter between President Nixon and the Prime Minister of Vietnam is to be
                    closely held under all circumstances. The figure should not be revealed in
                    Commission meetings or otherwise, nor should I countenance any suggestions that
                    American aid is offered as reparations. If efforts are made to place such
                    information in the record, “you should immediately adjourn. These are matters
                    which should only be discussed privately between you and the Head of their
                    delegation.”</p>
                <p>Kissinger said that the North Vietnamese view of the world is that they can
                    play-off the three great powers—the Soviet Union, China and the U.S. “They
                    deprecate the United States, but they are xenophobic toward all three,” he
                    said.</p>
                <p>What was the Rationale for Massive Aid to North Vietnam?</p>
                <p>In the coming six months of negotiations with the North Vietnamese I would ask
                    myself why such large aid, for what objectives and how would we know
                    success?</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>This was not intended as a development program although some economic development
                    might result. Rather U.S. objectives were political. President Nixon had spoken
                    of the disengagement of American forces and release of American prisoners, but
                    that objective was achieved within weeks after the January 27th signing of the
                    Paris Peace Agreement. The American prisoners were home in late March and our
                    forces withdrew rapidly.</p>
                <p>Henry Kissinger in briefing the U.S. staff of the Joint Economic Commission and
                    at a press conference said that the U.S. objective is “to develop a constructive
                    working relationship with the DRV and in so doing offer them an incentive toward
                    a more peaceful evolution” and that we give the DRV the impression that we are
                    serious in restoring economic relations, including reconstruction, but “the U.S.
                    will pay nothing in reparations”. These are generalities which mask as much as
                    they reveal.</p>
                <p>What Henry Kissinger really sought was to stabilize the balance of forces between
                    the North and South Vietnam in such a way that the South would survive the
                    withdrawal of U.S. forces. Since the North had more than held its own, in the
                    political and military struggle, with a U.S. army fully engaged - then special
                    measures were required to ensure that U.S. withdrawal left a militarily viable
                    South Vietnam. Then the U.S. government could claim it withdrew with Honor. The
                    almost $5 billion U.S. aid commitment by Nixon/Kissinger to the DRV was one of
                    those “special measures”.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the most difficult part of this policy of U.S. withdrawal was convincing
                    the South Vietnamese command structure. For in an effort to win the war - short
                    of obliterating the North - the military and economic apparatus of the South had
                    been thoroughly Americanized by President Johnson and his defense secretary,
                    Robert MacNamara, who built the level of American forces in Vietnam to 500,000.
                    Bolstering the South for U.S. withdrawal required a whole array of special and
                    sustaining measures, that are well beyond the scope of this account.</p>
                <p>But the key to the Nixon/Kissinger foreign policy both, globally and in Vietnam,
                    was achieving a balance of power by whatever means, and it is in these terms
                    that the carrot of massive economic aid to the DRV must be understood.</p>
                <p>Opening Negotiations on Two Tracks</p>
                <p>The meetings of the Joint Economic Commission were held at the Avenue Kleber
                    Conference Center which had formerly been the historic Majestic Hotel. An
                    elegant architectural structure, I first knew the Majestic as the Supreme
                    Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Force after the liberation of Paris in
                    1944. Before that it had been the headquarters of the German Forces occupying
                    France.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>The first meeting of the DRV-US Joint Economic Commission (JEC) on March 15th
                    opened with some fanfare. There was a gathering of the press and the flashing of
                    cameras as the respective delegations drove up in official cars. Moving briskly
                    to the conference room, I sat at a long table opposite 20 members of the North
                    Vietnamese delegation, headed by the Minister of Finance, Dang Viet Chou, a
                    fatherly-appearing figure in his early sixties. He was supported by Nguyen Co
                    Thach, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs (later to become Foreign Minister),
                    and Le Khac, Deputy Head of the Planning Commission. It was an impressive
                    lineup, indicative of the importance the DRV placed on American reconstruction
                    assistance.</p>
                <p>Minister Chou had been an early member of the communist resistance in Vietnam but
                    not a member of the Party Central Committee. As we eyed each other across the
                    table, I thought of the succession of senior positions Chou had held in the
                    Ministry of Foreign Trade, Planning Commission, the State Price Commission.</p>
                <p>Comparatively, the U.S. delegation was lightly staffed, numbering six on our side
                    of the table. In addition to myself, there was Donald Syvrud of Treasury, Robert
                    Mossler from the AID Mission in Saigon and William Marsh for State.</p>
                <p>After a formal exchange of greetings, I made brief opening remarks in an
                    optimistic vein, that our objective was to help heal the wounds of war and that
                    in the right framework of peace the United States was prepared to be generous in
                    application of American technology and resources for reconstruction.</p>
                <p>Minister Chou followed with a lengthy and detailed presentation of the political
                    and moral basis for American aid to North Vietnam. He described “the widespread
                    destruction and untold suffering inflicted by the tonnage of bombs and shells
                    the U.S. dumped on our land and people...that is four times bigger than the
                    tonnage of bombs and shells dropped by the U.S. in World War II.” Almost no
                    farmer's field had been spared from bomb craters, he said. Chou outlined the
                    main features of the destruction and needs for restoration in five sectors:
                    industry, agriculture, transport and communications; reconstruction of houses
                    and public utilities in towns and villages; and the urgent economic needs for
                    food and materials to stabilize economic activity and people's daily lives.</p>
                <p>Minister Chou's opening statement went on to his government's view on the JEC's
                    work program and calendar. The task ahead was to confirm the total aid agreed
                    between the DRV and the U.S. and to divide it into five annual segments of
                    equipment, commodities and factories according to requirements identified by the
                    DRV. Of the total aid, 25 percent was to be provided by the U.S. in cash for
                    procurement of equipment and goods from third countries, with the remainder to
                    be delivered from U.S. sources. Further, the U.S. should assure that the value
                    of total aid not be diminished by fluctuations in dollar parity.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>As to the working calendar, Chou said that Henry Kissinger and Le Duc Tho had
                    decided in Hanoi that the Joint Economic Commission would reach agreement on the
                    specific equipment and goods by sector to be financed by USAID over the five
                    years, and for each year, and on the modalities for implementation of the
                    program. This agenda was to be completed in 60 days from March 1st, 1963 - which
                    Chou said was when the JEC was to have held its first meeting.</p>
                <p>After this weighty presentation, we adjourned and I hosted the Vietnamese
                    delegation for lunch. Conversation at lunch was stiff reflecting clear
                    resentment from the recent U.S. bombing of Hanoi. “Why did you bomb us when the
                    negotiations on the Peace Accords were well advanced,” Chou asked accusingly.
                    There was a view that the Christmas bombing of Hanoi had been more to convince
                    the South Vietnamese leaders to support the negotiated peace and to help counter
                    their fears that the peace agreement up to that point had favored the North.</p>
                <p>Minister Chou clearly had set out the DRV's view of the agenda for the economic
                    track of our negotiations. A second political track would seek to link the
                    prospect of aid to compliance by the DRV with the military provisions of the
                    Peace Accords.</p>
                <p>Meeting at Gif-Sur-Yvette</p>
                <p>The next day I met with minister Chou and Deputy Minister Thach in a private
                    house in Gif-Sur-Yvette, a suburb of Paris, which had been where Henry Kissinger
                    and Le Duc Tho had conducted much of the negotiations leading to the Peace
                    Agreement. The house was considered secure in that before each meeting, it would
                    be swept clean of bugs. One had a sense of being in a historic place where great
                    decisions had taken place, a sense which Thach verbalized.</p>
                <p>Minister Chou said he welcomed private meetings since the substance of our
                    discussions could be broader. During the course of my entire negotiations with
                    the North Vietnamese on aid, the Joint Economic Commission was to meet 15 times
                    and there would be 27 private meetings. (Additionally our staffs held 19
                    technical discussions.) The real nut-cutting of negotiations was done in private
                    sessions between Minister Chou and myself.</p>
                <p>I opened the discussion, as instructed by Henry Kissinger, by expressing our
                    grave concern over the continuing violations of the Peace Agreement by the DRV.
                    The articles of the Peace Agreement were indivisible and unless the DRV adhered
                    to all the provisions, we did not see how they could expect the U.S. to proceed
                    with a program of aid for peaceful reconstruction — which they claimed they
                    sought to implement with our help.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>In particular, the recent massive infiltration of military equipment and men into
                    South Vietnam was a clear violation of Article 7 which only permitted the
                    replacement of military equipment and personnel on a one for one basis. In other
                    private meetings I would press the issue of adhering to provisions of Article 20
                    for a cease fire and withdrawal of DRV troops from Laos and Cambodia.</p>
                <p>I said, on instruction, that it would be a great tragedy if we misunderstood each
                    other on questions of compliance. Continuing these violations and miscalculation
                    on their part could lead President Nixon to a response similar to the U.S.
                    response of December 1972. (When the U.S. bombed Hanoi.) On the other hand, if
                    they truly sought to establish peace and to reconstruct their country they would
                    find us helpful and the work of the Joint Commission would prove fruitful.</p>
                <p>Thach responded with feeling that the U.S. had made a big mistake in December
                    1972 and that the Vietnamese people were not easily subdued by force. He then
                    suggested we break for tea.</p>
                <p>Thach was a coldly disciplined negotiator and a virtual archivist of past
                    discussions between Le Duc Tho and Henry Kissinger. “That point had been brought
                    up earlier and rejected,” Thach would say, quoting chapter and verse of the past
                    record. I gradually gained an appreciation of what Kissinger was up against and
                    had achieved. Thach seemed more an automat than a human being. In response to my
                    saying that I enjoyed walking the boulevards and gardens of Paris, he replied
                    that was an “inefficient way to exercise”.</p>
                <p>Chou also was disciplined but seemed a more human person, one whom I could
                    imagine missed being away from his home and family. He seemed truly interested
                    in securing the peace and in economic development; he told me on one occasion
                    that “it was hell to be minister of finance during war and see the waste of
                    resources.”</p>
                <p>Note on the Nature of the Peace Accords</p>
                <p>There were miscalculations and “technical” violations of the Peace Accords on
                    both sides. Essentially the negotiated peace of the Paris Agreement was in the
                    nature of a truce which hopefully could be solidified and extended into a stable
                    peace. In Vietnam this involved a “cease fire in place”, the release of all
                    prisoners, and the forces of each side agreeing to a standstill in the armaments
                    and territory they held at that time. That meant that the forces of North
                    Vietnam retained a number of territorial enclaves in South Vietnam - which some
                    journalists called the leopard's spots from the way they appeared on a map.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>As mentioned above, the cease fire was to facilitate the withdrawal of American
                    armed forces. In the process both the South and North Vietnamese sought to
                    stabilize their respective defenses by stock piling and upgrading arms, the
                    North with tank movements said to carry “civilians” (which was the concern of
                    the above mentioned private meeting), and the South by a substantial build-up of
                    their air force with U.S. collusion.</p>
                <p>In Laos and Cambodia, the Peace Agreement called for a “cease fire” with the
                    withdrawal of North Vietnamese troops, but the process by which this was to be
                    accomplished had not been fully detailed and apparently was somewhat ambiguous.
                    The North Vietnamese claimed that their withdrawal of troops from Laos depended
                    on prior agreement with the Laotians on setting up a coalition government -
                    which they stood to control. This was not in keeping with the U.S.
                    understanding, and Kissinger found it an “outrageous” interpretation of what had
                    been agreed. Hence, his objective was to link the prospects of U.S. aid with an
                    unequivocal withdrawal of DRV troops from Laos and Cambodia.</p>
                <p>Round &amp; Round the Wheel of Fortune Goes, Where Will It Stop?</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Minister Chou and I sparred round and round over our respective
                    approaches to aid and quickly arrived at an impasse. He sought to nail the
                    content and level of an entire five year program of aid, with amounts
                    apportioned by years and sectors, before being willing to consider the first
                    year program. My instructions were just the opposite: develop a first year
                    program and avoid the specifics of five year assistance. Also, Minister Chou
                    repeatedly sought agreement that 25 percent of the total aid would be in cash
                    for import of goods from third countries. My objective was to minimize a cash
                    component.</p>
                <p>Minister Chou presented us with a seven page detailed listing of their aid
                    requirements for equipment, raw materials and projects along the lines mentioned
                    in his opening statement. He refused to discuss with us their requirements in
                    terms of priorities, technical feasibility and capacity for use. It was only for
                    the U.S. to declare what it would provide of the goods on their list and on what
                    schedule.</p>
                <p>Their stated requirements envisioned a vast modernization and expansion of the
                    economy, well beyond reconstruction. The value of their request in U.S. prices
                    was about $9 billion, well over the $4.75 billion of aid promised by
                    Nixon/Kissinger. That they overshot the mark to such an extent is due in large
                    part to the difference in pricing between communist command economies - with its
                    price distortions and subsidies - and a market economy like the U.S. Even so,
                    they clearly sought to make up for the losses of the last ten years of war. At
                    the same time, they reflected confidence in the DRV's ability to make effective
                    use of all the aid requested.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>While we had conditioned the DRV delegation not to speak the word “reparations”,
                    it was clear that their view of our aid relationship was basically just that.
                    They were of the opinion that economic assistance was their “due” as a result of
                    the bombing and other military action and that the U.S. had a “moral commitment”
                    to “heal the wounds of war”.</p>
                <p>An Agreement on Principles, Functions and Working Procedures</p>
                <p>In an effort to get beyond the difficult impasse confronting us I proposed a set
                    of broad principles as a basis for guiding our work. This turned out to be
                    helpful and extended our mutual education.</p>
                <p>While we had no problem agreeing that “The DRV and U.S. will work on the basis of
                    respect for each other's sovereignty, non-interference in each other's internal
                    affairs, and equality and mutual benefit”, they objected to the principle that a
                    measure of normalization of economic relations between the two countries would
                    be an essential part of the program of reconstruction “in order to transfer
                    resources and technology effectively”. The U.S. obligation to provide aid under
                    Article 21 of the Peace Accords did not extend to normalization of relations
                    which they saw as a separate issue.</p>
                <p>Minister Chou also objected to my statement that economic assistance would be
                    planned to meet the “specific needs, priorities and capacities of the DRV and
                    its people”. Determining priorities, DRV capacities and how they used the aid
                    they said was entirely an internal affair not susceptible of discussion by the
                    JEC. Nor would the DRV provide any information on the contribution of other
                    donors to their reconstruction program so that U.S. assistance could be placed
                    in “the context of total needs and availabilities”—which is a normal requirement
                    of USAID presentations to Congress.</p>
                <p>Any suggestion of a multilateral approach to aid also was rejected by Minister
                    Chou as an infringement of DRV sovereignty. On this they apparently were
                    conditioned by how the Soviets managed their aid and trade relations with
                    countries of Eastern Europe - a process form which the DRV consistently held
                    aloof.</p>
                <p>As we proceeded slowly to evolve a program of U.S. aid for North Vietnam, I found
                    myself in a double bind. The objective of the aid enterprise was to maximize
                    influence and incentives toward a more peaceful evolution of DRV policies. This
                    meant U.S. practices of technical feasibility and accountability. At the same
                    time, I knew that any aid for North Vietnam would have to be fully justified to
                    a Congress which, far from being flexible, was certain to be hostile to the
                    whole enterprise and demanding of rigorous assurances of peaceful uses and
                    accountability.</p>
                <p>My entire experience as an AID administrator had been to relate aid policy and
                    program decisions to the test of whether it was defensible to potential
                    Congressional and public inquiry; aid to North Vietnam would be a severe
                    test.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>I undertook a series of educational briefings for the DRV delegation on U.S.
                    Constitutional processes, our normal practices in the assessment and
                    accountability of aid, and that Congress - not the President - was the final
                    authority with respect to ultimately deciding on any economic assistance
                    program.</p>
                <p>The North Vietnamese were amazingly well informed on American public opinion and
                    the anti-war movement, but they had difficulty in accepting that President Nixon
                    couldn't simply order aid for reconstruction even as he ordered military
                    operations. (They were partly right; President Nixon had reserve funds which
                    could be used to begin implementation of the aid prior to authorization by
                    Congress, according to Henry Kissinger.)Since my cable reporting to the State
                    Department was being passed to Congressional leaders - according to William
                    Casey - I was conscious of the importance of building a record for future
                    Congressional support. But, I also was sending separate reports on the White
                    House “back channel”, and the focus here was on concessions to influence the
                    North Vietnamese policy. “Include the steel mill they want” was one instruction
                    in this vein. In effect I was engaged in double reporting in my almost daily
                    cable reports to Washington - along with concerted efforts to move the whole
                    process forward. Those work days extended to 10 or 11 o'clock in the evening
                    before leaving the office for supper.</p>
                <p>After several weeks of intense discussions Minister Chou and I agreed on the
                    “Principles” document entitled “Principles, Functions, Organization and Working
                    Procedures of the DRV-US Joint Economic Commission”. It was a mix of the
                    original terms of reference for the Commission, working procedures, general
                    exhortations and agreed language on general principles; it was essentially an
                    internal working document. In early April we would both sign the document on
                    behalf of our respective governments, although I refused their request to
                    photograph the signing.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, the DRV delegation was all smiles and Minister Chou now agreed to
                    joint Technical Meetings for review of the DRV aid requirements for
                    reconstruction - but only by economic sectors as they related to the five year
                    program, not by specific projects. These technical discussions were conducted by
                    Bob Mossler and Le Khac, the Deputy for the DRV Planning Commission. As they
                    began their work, I returned to Washington on March 28th for a few days.</p>
                <p>When I met with Henry Kissinger, he laughingly mimicked the intonations and
                    phrases of the North Vietnamese. We reviewed the state of play in the
                    negotiations, and the following day Kissinger briefed Congressional leaders on
                    progress in implementing the Peace Agreement. Generally, it was a favorable
                    report: American prisoners had been released by Hanoi; while fighting continued
                    in Vietnam, it was at a low level of intensity and appeared to be winding down.
                    Kissinger stressed the importance of American aid in reconstruction to
                    consolidate peace.</p>
                <p>Shifting the Negotiations into High Speed</p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>On returning to Paris, I received new instructions to speed readiness of a first
                    year aid program for presentation to the Congress. At the same time, I was to
                    make it unmistakably clear that there was absolutely no possibility of aid from
                    the Congress in absence of strict observance by the North Vietnamese of the
                    terms of the cease fire and withdrawal of troops.</p>
                <p>The strategy was to package the aid “carrot”, and then not move it until there
                    was political compliance with the conditions of the Peace Agreement.</p>
                <p>Speeding preparations for aid pleased the North Vietnamese since they spoke
                    frequently of the urgent need to repair the war damage to their economy.</p>
                <p>Identifying a five year program of reconstruction was the necessary first step.
                    From the DRV list of requirements we selected commodities and equipment which we
                    estimated at about $3 billion (out of the massive shopping list of $9 billion)
                    and in a preliminary way identified five annual trances. On seeing our
                    calculation, Minister Chou objected that we had omitted five important projects,
                    namely complete plants for steel, trucks and tractors, diesel motors, ship
                    building, and petro-chemicals. There also were light industry projects for yarn,
                    textiles and silk as well as air conditioners and port facilities.</p>
                <p>They placed emphasis on 41 industrial plants (out of an alleged 300 destroyed by
                    bombing), but they admitted that some of the plants they sought were new.
                    Industrial equipment represented 62 percent of their request; transport and
                    communications 12 percent; agriculture 6 percent, and shelter and maintenance of
                    living conditions, 20 percent.</p>
                <p>The task was to divide DRV requirements into what could be considered in the
                    first two years and those which would fall into the last three years of the aid
                    program. Minister Chou and I finally agreed that such a five year program would
                    be an “approximation”, after he fought like a tiger to avoid my insistence on
                    the term “preliminary”. Where precision was important we worked in both
                    languages and one was never sure of the nuances of translation. For me
                    “approximate” was good enough, but he would return again and again to aspects of
                    the five year program.</p>
                <p>A first year level of grants was agreed at $650 million with 16 percent in cash,
                    but only after arduous bargaining, for Chou initially sought much more in both
                    categories on the grounds of the urgency of their needs for early repair of war
                    damage. In the process of gaining agreement, I offered to assist the DRV to
                    raise funds with other donors to help meet their urgent requirements for spare
                    parts and equipment from non-U.S. sources.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>My objective was to focus the first year program on basic human needs: food,
                    clothing and shelter - although the actual content was on the tools and
                    equipment to secure basic needs, as well as related restoration of
                    communications and transport for their distribution. As to possible future
                    industrial projects, the program we agreed included $10 million for feasibility
                    and engineering studies.</p>
                <p>A persistent point by the DRV team concerned an alleged assurance by Henry
                    Kissinger during earlier negotiation in Hanoi that the U.S. grant aid would
                    maintain a set value in spite of devaluation. Consequently, when the U.S. went
                    off the gold standard in early 1973 and the dollar was devalued against major
                    world currencies, Chou sought a compensating upward adjustment in the promised
                    aid level. I gave Chou a list of countries which held a parity in currency
                    exchange with the U.S. dollar, and let it go at that.</p>
                <p>Regarding reimbursable commodity aid (promised at $1 billion to $1.5 billion), we
                    initially developed an illustrative PL 480 package of wheat flour, rice, corn
                    and vegetable oil which could be provided on humanitarian grounds. However,
                    there were insuperable problems.</p>
                <p>Chou sought productive tools and equipment rather than consumable commodities,
                    and assurance of firm annual commitments over five years, both of which were
                    impossible under U.S. PL 480 legislation.</p>
                <p>The real problem was that the previously large U.S. food grain reserves had been
                    transferred to the Soviet Union on highly concessionary terms. This was a
                    feature of the Nixon/Kissinger geopolitical balance known as detente, which
                    presumably had yielded some strategic advantages for the U.S. However, the loss
                    of U.S. food grain reserves played havoc with food markets, both domestically
                    and globally. With widespread drought of 1974 and resulting food grain
                    shortages, prices soared and there were severe hardships for many in the U.S.
                    and abroad. Under any circumstances, North Vietnam was a low order claimant and
                    I simply glossed over the issue with Minister Chou.</p>
                <p>Generally, however, we were progressing at a rapid pace with agreement on the
                    detailed contents of a five year program of reconstruction assistance by sector
                    and annual amounts, as well as a carefully defined first year program. Such was
                    our progress that Minister Chou presented me with a draft Protocol of the
                    program for our respective signatures.</p>
                <p>Then on April 19th, 1993 I was instructed to break off negotiations abruptly with
                    the North Vietnamese in Paris and return to Washington for extended
                    consultations.</p>
                <p>Getting Le Duc Tho's Attention</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>The economic track of negotiations to heal the wounds of war had gotten ahead of
                    the political track of compliance by the DRV with the terms of the Peace
                    Agreement, especially as concerned Laos.</p>
                <p>While I had continued to link the prospect of aid with compliance in the
                    withdrawal of troops, Minister Chou would routinely respond that President Nixon
                    had given assurances that U.S. aid for reconstruction was without political
                    conditions and that, in any case, these were matters which should be taken up in
                    another channel. Clearly I wasn't getting the message across.</p>
                <p>But Henry Kissinger wasn't getting through to Le Duc Tho on Laos and a continued
                    military presence by the DRV in Laos had tactical advantages affecting the
                    military stalemate between the North and the South which underlie the Vietnam
                    peace.</p>
                <p>On April 24, I attended a meeting at the White House of the senior NSC staff.
                    They said that suspending the aid negotiations had succeeded in getting Le Duc
                    Tho's attention; the tone of messages had changed immediately and were more
                    conciliatory. How badly did they want our aid, how far could they be pushed?
                    There was an opening to reformulate the terms of the troop withdrawal from Laos,
                    although views differed as to long-term prospects. A view was expressed that
                    given the situation in Laos, the U.S. lacked the means to restrict the influence
                    of the North Vietnamese. However, Kissinger was adamant: “The North must adhere
                    to the cease fire or accept the consequences”.</p>
                <p>Following further negotiations between Kissinger and Le Duc Tho, I was instructed
                    to return to Paris on June 14th and “make pretty speeches” for 15 days, but not
                    “conclude anything” until movement by the DRV was clear. We would know by July
                    3rd, Kissinger said. Apparently, Le Duc Tho had insisted on resumption of aid
                    discussions before considering any move on their side.</p>
                <p>On June 25th I was called form Paris for a meeting at the California White House
                    in San Clemente. Henry Kissinger wanted a precise scenario on options for
                    further negotiations on aid in Paris. The status was as follows:</p>
                <p>- We had “agreed” a first year aid program - stopping just short of joint
                    verification of the text. It could be sent to the Congress without further work.
                    For the DRV the next step was signature by the two governments.</p>
                <p>- On the five year “agreed conclusions”, we had not agreed key points on the
                    level of aid, although the DRV leaders had convinced themselves that they have a
                    firm “commitment” figure. Further discussion would risk weakening that
                    conviction and our political leverage.</p>
                <p>- What remained to be negotiated were modalities of implementation for an aid
                    program with North Vietnam.</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>A factor in the equation was a recent law passed by the Congress - the Case Act
                    of August 22, 1972 - that any international agreement, other than a treaty, to
                    which the United States is a party shall be notified to the Congress no later
                    than 60 days from its entry into force. My signing of “aid conclusions”, sought
                    by the DRV, would start the clock for notification to the Congress.</p>
                <p>On July 3rd I got the word to formally resume negotiations. We indicated this
                    intent by a press statement that said: “Following fifteen days of discussion,
                    the U.S.—DRV Joint Economic Commission has decided to continue its work in
                    Paris.” In retrospect, it is interesting that Minister Chou and I met on nine
                    separate occasions during those 15 days of standpat “pretty speeches”, and that
                    he also understood we were play acting.</p>
                <p>Focusing on Aid Implementation</p>
                <p>During three weeks in July we engaged in intensive discussion with the DRV
                    delegation in 18 separate meetings on arrangements for aid implementation.</p>
                <p>I sought a meeting of the JEC in Hanoi as essential to follow-up presentation of
                    an aid request to the Congress. A program which had been entirely worked out in
                    Paris, without any apparent review on site, in North Vietnam, would lack
                    validity. Minister Chou was cautious; “Would I raise questions of political
                    compliance with the Peace Accords if I went to Hanoi,” he asked? Apparently my
                    incessant linkage of aid and compliance had not been welcome. The response from
                    the DRV government was that a JEC meeting in Hanoi would only be possible after
                    I signed the “agreed conclusions”.</p>
                <p>We did agree on setting up small JEC offices in Washington and Hanoi to
                    facilitate implementation, and the text of a bilateral country agreement.</p>
                <p>At a series of expert-level meetings there was review of concluding documents and
                    modalities of implementation, led by Bob Mossler and DRV Planning Chief Le Khac.
                    My instruction to Mossler was to adopt language “which recognizes the contingent
                    nature of these conclusions, for we cannot undertake any promise to perform
                    which is not subject to approval by the Congress”. From our point of view “Words
                    which express future intentions or plans - finding, study, intention, prepared
                    to recommend - are preferred”.Le Khac presented extensive arguments for placing
                    sizable sums at the unrestricted disposal of the DRV. He maintained that the DRV
                    should enjoy full unilateral authority in banking arrangements, selection of
                    shipper, and contractual arrangements with vendors. He termed customary AID
                    procedures inapplicable because U.S. “contributions” to North Vietnam were
                    unlike usual aid programs. Mossler held that AID procedures were of mutual
                    advantage, as well as reasonable safeguards of important U.S. fiscal and
                    economic interests, and that we wished to take full advantage of U.S. banking
                    and shipping services.</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>The final outcome was to agree on modified AID practices for essentially
                    commercial procurement which, although more complex that
                    government-to-government procedures, seemed suited to DRV political
                    proclivities. Completely unresolved was any agreement on verification on the use
                    of aid.</p>
                <p>Suspension of Aid Negotiations</p>
                <p>In a private meeting with Minister Chou, on July 21st, I emphasized political
                    problems related to the Peace Agreement which were not being resolved. He
                    complained strenuously with injection of issues which were extraneous to the
                    work of the Commission.</p>
                <p>On July 23, I was instructed to suspend negotiations and to warn the DRV that “If
                    there is any publication of discussions in the JEC, we will finally and
                    irrevocably break off talks” on any American aid for reconstruction.</p>
                <p>My last discussion with Minister Dang Viet Chou was over the wording of our joint
                    press statement. We did not say that there had been progress: nor did we say, as
                    Minister Chou suggested, that our discussions had been “cordial and
                    constructive”.</p>
                <p>The agreed press statement simply noted that “Negotiation by the parties of the
                    Joint Economic Commission were “temporarily suspended in order that they could
                    report to their respective governments” and that “No agreements had been
                    reached”.</p>
                <p>The suspension proved permanent; the JEC never met again.</p>
                <p>Endgame on Aid for North Vietnam</p>
                <p>In December 1973 Henry Kissinger was to meet again with Le Doc Tho and the
                    question came up of my return to reopen the JEC talks. I strongly argued against
                    renewal of JEC meetings until such a time as the Administration was in a
                    position to inform Congress, formally or informally, about the substance of the
                    agreement.</p>
                <p>Otherwise Minister Chou and I would be forced into a charade of talks about
                    matters that had been essentially resolved. I could quibble over details and
                    possibly raise questions of Hanoi's aid from other countries, but these
                    approaches would not be productive.To be effective a further meeting of the JEC
                    would mean signing an agreement on a first-year program, contingent on
                    satisfactory DRV performance on all articles of the Paris Agreement. Senator
                    Mansfield in an on-the-record Congressional hearing had already pushed me very
                    hard to reveal what had been agreed. I held out but a further round of JEC
                    meetings would lead to much stiffer Congressional inquiry and tend to limit any
                    benefits of further discussion of aid with the North Vietnamese. The real
                    problem, I concluded, is that we were offering an imaginary carrot, and Congress
                    would quickly reveal this fact if they focused on the issue.</p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>In the Spring of 1974 there were press reports that Secretary of State Henry
                    Kissinger had tentatively agreed with North Vietnam's Chief Negotiator Le Doc
                    Tho on large-scale U.S. aid in exchange for a decision by Hanoi to withhold a
                    threatened major offensive against South Vietnam.</p>
                <p>A year later, in early April 1975, the forces of North Vietnam captured Saigon.
                    The pictures of Americans scrambling to get out of Saigon shocked the world. At
                    the time, I was in Paris chairing a meeting of representatives from OECD
                    governments. The general view expressed informally was that the American
                    prestige had been badly damaged and would not soon recover.</p>
                <p>I acknowledged that the Vietnam experience had left deep scars on the American
                    psychic and social fabric. The tragedy of the entire Vietnam experience was that
                    vital American interests had not been engaged. This being the case, I took the
                    view that the fundamentals of American strength and influence remained
                    intact.</p>
                <p>On May 21st 1977 the Government of Vietnam made public the documents affirming
                    the U.S. Government's pledges to contribute to healing the would of war and to
                    post war reconstruction in Vietnam as stipulated in Article 21 of the Paris
                    Agreement on Vietnam. In addition to the exchange of messages between President
                    Nixon and the Premier of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and other related
                    exchanges, there was a Note from Maurice Williams, Chief of the U.S. Delegation
                    to the DRV-U.S. Joint Economic Commission, dated 6 April 1973.</p>
                <p>The U.S. Government also made the documents available to the public and
                    acknowledged their validity.</p>
                <p>Some members of Congress expressed shock both at the secret agreement and at the
                    large amount of aid which had been promised on behalf of the United States,
                    which even to that time had been a well kept secret. Both President Nixon and
                    Henry Kissinger declared that the agreement was invalid since Vietnam had not
                    complied with the Paris Peace Agreement. The House voted against providing any
                    American aid for reconstruction of Vietnam, and demanded full accounting of
                    American service personnel missing in action.</p>
                <p>Was there ever any prospect that President Nixon and henry Kissinger intended to
                    submit a request to the Congress and defend an appropriation of funds for North
                    Vietnam? In principle, it seemed possible as part of the package of measures to
                    secure the peace. Perhaps, there was an intention to do so in the early stages
                    of implementing the Paris Peace Agreement - several weeks following the January
                    27, 1973 signing of the agreement to the end of March - when the American
                    prisoners of war were released.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>However, once the prisoners returned and South Vietnam's defenses appeared to be
                    holding, then the prospect of aid became illusionary. Veterans of the Vietnam
                    war, and particularly the former prisoners of war, constituted a powerful public
                    voice opposing the very idea of aid to North Vietnam, and they had ready support
                    in Congress. It also could be said that given the ambiguities of many of the
                    provisions in the Paris Agreement - and the years of distrust by the warring
                    parties - full compliance was a near impossibility.</p>
                <p>In its latter stages, discussions of American aid for North Vietnam became a form
                    of charade, an illusionary game in which Henry Kissinger excelled, but in the
                    end the game was lost.</p>
                <p>The Republic is Grateful</p>
                <p>During 1974 the Nixon White House consolidated its control of the bureaucracy by
                    removal of senior officials believed to be too independent or too liberal. John
                    Hannah, as Administrator of AID, was both. He was summarily dismissed (by phone
                    while on vacation in Michigan) in favor of Dan Parker. Loyal to Hannah, both
                    personally and as his deputy, I was deeply disturbed by the changes.</p>
                <p>It was suggested that I accept an ambassadorship in a foreign post, and among
                    those offered were: Indonesia, the U.S. Delegation to the OECD and Chairman of
                    the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC). I indicated a preference for
                    the latter and, following approval by the 18 member governments of the DAC, I
                    was posted to Paris in that position.— Maurice Williams</p>
