                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the fourth of February, 2003. This is an
                        interview with Robert E. McCarthy. This is being done on behalf of the
                        Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training, and I'm Charles Stuart
                        Kennedy. Do you call yourself “Bob?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, Bob McCarthy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bob, well, let's start at the beginning. When and where
                        you born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: I was born in Toronto, Canada, in 1942.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And, how did you happen to... were you a Canadian family
                        or...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Prior to WWII, my mother came to the U.S. She was a Canadian who lived
                    outside Toronto in a small town. She saw an advertisement and came down to New
                    York City to work for British Intelligence. For Sir William Stephenson... the
                    “Intrepid” book and “The Quiet Canadian.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, I was trying to say, he was the Spymaster.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes. His offices were at Rockefeller Center. My mother worked there,
                    and during that time met my father. .He was born and raised in New York City,
                    lived and died within a mile of where he was born in New York. They married. My
                    father was in the service for four years, so she went back up to Canada, where I
                    was born in 1942. She lived with her mother, and I was there for the first four
                    years of my life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, well let's go back. Could you tell me about your
                        father and the McCarthys? What history do you know? How did they come to the
                        United States and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, they came, my great-grandfather, great-grandmother... They had a
                    farm in New York State, north of New York City. There was a quarrel over the
                    inheritance... they moved to New York City... My father's family all lived in
                    upper New York City around the George Washington Bridge. He had five siblings.
                    They lived in two apartment buildings very close to each other, with several
                    families in each apartment building. A number of the men went into the police
                    department. My father was a Port Authority police officer, two of his
                    brothers-in-law were New York City police detectives. My mother's family is from
                    Canada; originally they came from Scotland and England.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was her maiden name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Her maiden name was Heggie. They lived in a small town outside of
                    Toronto, which is now a major suburban community, almost part of Toronto. She
                    also came from a big family - five siblings. .She is the only one who left.
                    Since the war, she has lived as a resident alien in the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you grow up in New York?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes. I grew up in a working-class neighborhood, Washington Heights, at
                    the upper part of Manhattan Island, close to where the Hudson River and Harlem
                    River Barge Canal meet. The neighborhood was predominantly Irish, Jewish (a lot
                    of �migr�s around the war) Greeks, Armenians, and then a sprinkling of other
                    nationalities.Q: Did you grow up in a police atmosphere, I mean a police family
                    was it pretty much, nor not?</p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Not really. I mean if you listen to my father's political views, you'd
                    never think he was a cop. He was very much on the other side of most of those
                    issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sort of liberal...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Very much so. So it was not a cop family. I know what you're talking
                    about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was what I was asking.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: There were cop families, and I know what you mean. It wasn't like that
                    at all. His approach to things was quirkier. He liked eccentrics. You'd be
                    walking down the street and people would be crossing the street to avoid this
                    person acting strangely, and my father would prefer to engage him in
                    conversation. I think had made some kind of impression on me, that there are a
                    lot of interesting folks in the world if you keep open to it all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that's great. Did you have brothers, sisters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: One sister, who lives in New York.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well where did you go to school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: St. Elizabeth's grammar school, which was the local parish school, for
                    eight years. Then I went to Fordham Preparatory School, which is a Jesuit high
                    school, on the campus of Fordham University in the Bronx. After that I went on
                    to Fordham University and later to Indiana University for a master's degree in
                    Russian language and literature, and then I spent some time in the Army. I
                    worked as an executive trainee in Stern's department store, taught
                    speed-reading...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's go back. Let's go back to grammar school. Was
                        your grammar school run by nuns?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: It was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they, when you stories about them, was it a pretty
                        strict school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: This was a teaching order, the Order of the Holy Child, and they were
                    actually good. They had 50 kids in a class and managed to maintain order, teach,
                    and keep you interested. There were a few crazy nuns, of course. There always
                    were, and everybody realized that. But they were not nuns who had these
                    fantastical ideas, outlawed patent leather shoes, and all that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the elementary school, any particular things that
                        particularly interested you... started you off on something...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: No, I think I was just a normal kid... played basketball, baseball, got
                    a football and went up to the field after school. We were really lucky in that
                    part of New York City, because we had a lot of parks. Washington Heights was
                    high up, and the breezes came through. There was always something going on -
                    sports, street games, and stickball.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the ethnic mix in your school, in your
                        neighborhood. Did you get involved in that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, there was a public school and a Catholic school in the
                    neighborhood. And if you took any one age group, say all the kids that were in
                    the seventh grade and added them all up, you'd probably have 250-300 kids within
                    an area of 10 blocks by 5 blocks, that's a LOT of kids your age in one place.
                    And as I say, a lot of Jewish families, a lot of Irish families, a lot of
                    Greeks, relative to the total number of Greeks in New York. On Greek New Year,
                    you'd see the candles flickering all over the neighborhood. Not very many
                    Blacks, some Puerto Ricans, some Italians, a large Armenian community... There's
                    a large Armenian church there. In my school, it was Catholic, which in our
                    neighborhood meant predominantly Irish. When you played with kids on the block,
                    it was a complete mixture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the kids gang up on each other?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: To some extent, but I've read accounts of people growing up in New
                    York, where things were much more tribal. Irish kids talked about never having
                    known Jewish kids, and they thought the whole world was Ireland. That kind of
                    isolation was not present in our neighborhood. There was some taunting, some
                    gang fights, but nothing extreme. The ethnic differences came out in other ways
                    usually. For example, I can remember going down to a Greek bakery with a Greek
                    friend of mine and being so turned on by the different pastries and delicacies.
                    And the Armenian kids would be running home to get kefta from the grandmothers.
                    I don't mean to say everything was ideal. Some of the Irish kids taunted the
                    Jewish kids, but it was a small minority that did that and it was episodic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you moved to high school, how did you find the
                        Jesuits and their teaching there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: I liked the Jesuits a lot. They saw themselves as distinct from the
                    nuns who had been our teachers up until then, and made no secret about it. It
                    was a revelation to have a priest stand up in front of the class and talk about
                    “Sister Mary Holy Candle Half Lit” or “Holy Mother Christ Lost in the Temple.”
                    They were disparaging, but well- meant remarks. The Jesuits saw themselves as
                    being on a higher plane intellectually and as demanding more. I thought they
                    were pretty good teachers and very interested in the students. They were strict
                    enough, but it wasn't like the Irish Christian Brothers. There were no rubber
                    hoses in the closets, there was no taking you into the storeroom and working you
                    over. The approach was more subtle. For example, The Prefect of Discipline at
                    Fordham Prep, Father Arthur Shay, could go into an auditorium of 500 students
                    who'd all be talking and buzzing, and he'd go up onto the stage and stand there.
                    Then he'd give this slight tilt of his shoulders and a slight arching of his
                    head, and the whole room would fall silent. Completely. And I think we got the
                    impression that learning was fun and it was just what you did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was all boys, I take it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: It was all boys.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At elementary school, all boys too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Half and half. Girls sat on one side of the classroom. Boys sat on the
                    other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the high school, what courses grabbed you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: I liked English and Latin. They were the two subjects I liked most.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there, one hears the Jesuit using, have their own
                        approach to logic and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Right.Q: Did they drill that in to you?</p>
                <p>McCARTHY: I don't think they drilled it, as a lesson to be conveyed in itself.
                    But in class, you were expected to defend your positions. They encouraged you to
                    state your views and then defend them. They wouldn't hesitate to give their
                    point of view and critique your reasoning. I think that came across strongly.
                    Probably any good teacher is like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any extracurricular activities?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, a lot of intramural sports. There were big fields up there at the
                    time, Fordham wasn't very built up, so after school it was very easy to grab a
                    basketball and go out and play on the basketball court, or grab a football on
                    the football field. And that's the way I used to do... I'd stay after school and
                    play.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about at home? Was there a much, did the outside world
                        intrude... I mean you say your father had a broad interest... Sort of at the
                        dinner table would you discuss things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes. Anything that came up. But it wasn't formal - not “Let's sit
                    around the table, and we're going to discuss these topics. This is for the
                    betterment of you children... I want each of you to take a point of view.” None
                    of that. The outside world also intruded via the library. The books that my
                    mother got out of the library were just lying around. I remember reading so many
                    different things that I didn't go out and get personally - you know, Vance
                    Packard, Mary McCarthy, lots of topical books were lying around. And I went to
                    the library myself a great deal. My father liked to talk and argue and discuss
                    and more or less set us straight on the proper view of the world.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about politics? Where did the family...you say your

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the world beyond New York City? Did that come in
                        at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Well, it did because we went to Canada every summer. The whole Canadian
                    side of the family ended up at this one lake, 100-120 miles north of Toronto. My
                    great uncle was shell shocked after World War I, and he ended up there for the
                    peace and quiet. He had been in banking but it didn't work out after the war.
                    So, he went into semi-retirement up there, sold real estate, did some other
                    things. Gradually, that became the area where people went in the summers. So,
                    every summer I was with my aunts and uncles and all their kids around this lake.
                    And “the world beyond New York City” intruded, in the sense that it was clear
                    very early that there other ways of looking at the world. Ways other than the
                    way Americans looked at the world. You know, you'd see a monument to the
                    Loyalists who fell in the War of 1812. And there would be something to the
                    effect that thanks to those brave men, if they hadn't done what they'd done, we
                    Canadians might be- perish the thought - Americans today. [laughter] You know
                    that type of thing. It was a different point of view.</p>

                        what defines Canadians is that they're not Americans.</hi>

                <p>McCARTHY: Absolutely.</p>

                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, sure. Very early on, view that the United States was too
                    disorderly, too violent, sort of too immature, in a nice way. And yes, I always
                    felt that they did have this sense of not being Americans.</p>

                <p>McCARTHY: And there was a lingering British influence. The issue of the new
                    Canadian flag split my family into two camps. As you recall, the question was
                    whether to have the Union Jack or the maple leaf on the flag. Different people
                    were on different sides of that. But as far as I was concerned, there was no
                    intensity of feeling. No accusation, “You're an American...” It was more joking.
                    My cousins would have friends over and say, “Bob, tell us where you're from.”
                    And I'd say, “New Yawk,” and they'd burst into peals of laughter, you know, that
                    type of thing. [laughter]</p>

                <p>McCARTHY: It's been homogenized because of the Foreign Service. I definitely had
                    a strong New York accent. It comes back when I'm with New York friends from my
                    youth.Q: Well, you were really on a straight course, from the nuns, to the
                    Fordham boys school and then you went to Fordham.</p>

                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: [laughter] Well, that's true actually. I don't think I did particularly
                    think about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you went to Fordham University too, the

                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, Fordham College on the Rose Hill campus in the Bronx, a part of
                    Fordham University.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you at all on the priestly track? Or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nobody tried to work on you for that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Well, it was pretty subtle. There was one semi-counseling session where
                    one of the scholastics, the status one has before one becomes a priest, asked
                    me, “Bob, have you thought of the priesthood?” And I said, “Well, I've pretty
                    much thought of everything.” “You've thought of everything, and you are still
                    thinking about the priesthood?” he responded. That was one of those “Objection.
                    Counsel is leading the witness” moments. But I had a wonderful out, because my
                    mother was Protestant. Any time anything about religion came up, like in grammar
                    school you were sort of pressured to be either a choirboy or an altar boy, and
                    they'd ask me in class which I preferred, and I'd say, “Well, I'll have to check
                    with my mother.” Those were the magic words. Suddenly everybody backed off. I
                    suppose they figured: Let it be. He's in a Catholic school, God knows what would
                    happen to him if we upset his mother. It gave me lots of running room.</p>
                <p>The same thing at Fordham Prep. The counselor would bring you in and say, “Now,
                    Robert, I understand that your mother is... um... Protestant...” like it was
                    almost too horrible to mention the word. That gave me a lot of slack.

                        have gotten so loose, but there was a time that if you were Catholic this
                        set you apart. And if you were many other things, I mean people were put in
                        little boxes. Did you feel that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Not really, and it was probably because New York was so big, and there
                    were so many Catholics there and there were so many Catholics in my
                    neighborhood, so many Catholics that I associated with that I didn't really
                    think of it as being a little box at all. I never heard a Pat-and-Mike joke,
                    which is a type of ethnic joke that makes fun of the Irish, until I was in the
                    Foreign Service. [laughter]</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: You could conclude, looking at the St. Elizabeth-Fordham Prep-Fordham
                    College lock step, that I was isolated. I didn't feel it. I felt that I was in
                    the best city in the world. There couldn't possibly be anything more
                    interesting. Why would anyone go anywhere else? And people had that feeling,
                    even if they had never been ten blocks south of where they lived or ten blocks
                    north. It was just something you drank in with the New York water. Ultimately
                    it's a bit provincial, I guess.Q: Speaking of which, did you get out and around
                    New York?</p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, a lot. It was wonderful. You did everything. You went to folk
                    dances. You'd go down and get fifty-cent tickets to watch the football Giants
                    play. You'd pay a buck or so to stand in back of the back of the theater and
                    watch the New York City Ballet. You'd get tickets to look at the opera and be
                    way up in the family circle for a very reasonable price. Outdoor concerts in
                    Lewinsohn Stadium, interrupted by police sirens. Different religions. I remember
                    one New Year's going out to a Coptic church in Brooklyn (now for us, Brooklyn
                    was really far away) for a religious ceremony. Everything was there, anything
                    weird or wonderful that you wanted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At Fordham, did you major right away, or did you figure
                        what you wanted to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: I majored in Russian studies, and in part I think that's because in
                    1958 right after Sputnik there was an intense interest in Russian and a feeling
                    that the U.S. needed to catch up. Fordham had a good Russian program, and the
                    department wanted to experiment with offering language classes to high-school
                    students. So, if students at Fordham Prep were willing to stay after school for
                    extra language classes, they could take a shot at learning Russian. The
                    university wanted to see how well high-school students could learn the language.
                    I volunteered, and the faculty made it a very interesting and congenial
                    experience. Lots of proverbs, not too stressful. I really liked the language and
                    how it sounded and the culture as well.</p>

                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: It's a beautiful language. So, at Fordham University I took Russian and
                    then majored in Russian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any time at Columbia University, which was

                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: When we had our yearly oral exams, there was often a Columbia
                    University professor there on the panel who would quiz us in Russian. Other than
                    that, I had no formal connections with Columbia.</p>

                <p>McCARTHY: I was very interested in it. I wasn't out working the polls or anything
                    that direct. But the election created a big stir. Looking back when you think of
                    Quemoy and Matsu...</p>

                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: I don't think so. I do remember putting down the Foreign Service as a
                    possible option in answer to the “What do you want to be when you grow up?”
                    question on some questionnaire. But I hadn't really thought about it seriously.
                    It was definitely not a specific trajectory that I had in mind.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, go ahead.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: I was at American University here in Washington, DC, in the stacks of
                    the library. I was a Ph.D. program in International Relations, and a classmate
                    asked me, “Are you going to take the Foreign Service exam tomorrow, Bob” and I
                    said, “Are they giving it tomorrow?” He said, “Yes.” And I said, “Well, maybe I
                    will.” Then he told me, “Well actually, you know, you have to sign up about
                    eight weeks in advance.”</p>
                <p>But I decided to call anyway. So I called up about the exam, and I don't know how
                    this happened, but I talked to this wonderful woman who was going to proctor
                    this exam. She explained to me that I was a little behind the curve, because,
                    you know, people think about this months ahead of time. But she said that they
                    did not a full house, so if I came down an hour early she would register me to
                    take the exam. It was in one of the government buildings downtown. So I went
                    early, she registered me, and I took the exam. What a wonderful act of kindness,
                    stepping outside normal bureaucratic limitations.</p>

                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: I got heavily into philosophy. Read lot outside class, went to
                    presentations and lectures, speeches at other colleges, took an evening course
                    at another college. More than the norm.</p>

                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Significant others came about sophomore year in college for me, a
                    little later than for some other folks. I was not exactly “going steady” but did
                    have a steady girlfriend for a couple of years there. We also went to mixers at
                    other schools. Someone would have a car and there would be a dance and punch.
                    And the other big social event, using the term loosely, was the beer racket. It
                    was very simple. You paid to get in, and that entitled you to as much beer as
                    you could drink, so everybody felt they had to get their money's worth. Some of
                    them were small, some were huge. Some ended with the riot police being called.
                    It was a strange social custom.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you graduated in 1964?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went to Indiana.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Indiana University, Russian language and literature.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well Indiana University was sort of the pre... I was just
                        interviewing another man who, Harry Gilmore, I don't know if you know
                        him...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: I know the name. He was in Belgrade too, wasn't he?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, he was in Belgrade too, and he went to Indiana
                        because he wanted to take Russian studies. Did anyone direct you
                        there?McCARTHY: No, I went to the library and researched it pretty
                        thoroughly. Indiana was definitely one of the best programs in the country,
                        and the course offerings looked best there.</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Columbia interest you at all? Or you wanted to get out
                        of New York?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, but I didn't like the courses as well, and I thought why not do
                    something a little different? And also, you know, at that time you could apply
                    for a national defense foreign language fellowship, which was very lucrative.
                    You had your tuition paid plus about $2200 to cover other expenses. It was a
                    princely sum. I received one of those fellowships at Indiana.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were they designed for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: These were for critical foreign languages under the National Defense
                    Foreign Languages Act. The goal was to support the study of languages where the
                    government believed we needed expertise. The act encouraged study of those
                    critical languages and the development of the strong teaching and research
                    centers, where students could study.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any commitment, I mean once you did it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: No, nothing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to Bloomington from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: I went there from fall of '64 to summer of '65.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find it there?McCARTHY: Wonderful. It just
                        blew apart all my stereotypes about civilization ending at the Hudson River,
                        and of this vast undifferentiated wasteland out there in the middle of the
                        United States. I had all those New York stereotypes. We lived in a graduate
                        residence center with students from all over the world, a great mix of
                        people. And there was a huge concentration of ethnic Russians in
                        Bloomington. In fact, Bloomington reportedly had the highest per capita
                        concentration of native Russian speakers in the country at that time.
                        Bloomington itself was small, after all, and there were all these special
                        Russian programs. There was a large Air Force program to teach the language.
                        The university had a special program for high school teachers who were
                        taking a year out to retool so they could teach Russian. There was a big
                        Russian history program and there was a big Russian language and literature
                        program. All of that made it a very rich experience for a student.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>And then I ended up with a lot of Korean graduate students, 3 or 4 Korean
                    graduate students. We'd eat together and talk endlessly. There were fabulous
                    performances at the excellent school of music, and professional touring groups
                    played at the university theater. This was an eye-opener for me. The New York
                    City Ballet performed, for example. Students attended, of course, but busloads
                    of people also came from the small towns in the area. I was very moved by that.
                    It was something that never occurred to me. I thought that these troupes would
                    go to the big cities, but a town likBloomington, Indiana never would have
                    crossed my mind. Another striking feature of the campus was its natural beauty,
                    especially those crisp, clear winter days with a blue sky and white snow on the
                    ground. It was a wonderful time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What section of the Russian studies were you working
                        on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Russian literature and language, with a preference for the language...
                    I didn't have really firm career plans, so I was not about to specialize in, say
                    the influence of early childhood experiences on Dostoevsky's prose style or
                    anything that esoteric.Q: So you were there about a year, I guess.</p>
                <p>McCARTHY: I finished my coursework there. In a year. I did not take the
                    comprehensive exams that they gave after that. Rather I came back to New York
                    and was supposed to go to the Soviet Union as a Russian-speaking guide on a USA
                    exhibit “Handtools USA.” However, the Soviets canceled it because of some
                    dispute arising from the Vietnam War. At any rate I wound up as an executive
                    trainee in a department store in New York and studied for my comprehensive
                    exams. After passing the exams in January, I think it was, I got my master's
                    degree. By that time it was '66 and I went into the service. I'd been in ROTC in
                    college and had that military obligation to fulfill. That seemed like a good
                    time to do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in the military, what, for...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As an officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, as a second lieutenant, and then I rose rapidly through the ranks
                    to first lieutenant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did they do with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: I was in military intelligence. First there was infantry officer
                    training at Fort Benning, Georgia and then intelligence officers school at Fort
                    Holabird in Baltimore. Almost all graduates of those programs were going to
                    Vietnam, many in their secondary MOS (military occupational specialty), as
                    infantry platoon leaders. This was not a very pleasant prospect. Our particular
                    group just got luck of the draw. The army had reduced strength so much in
                    Europe, they had to divert one class to fill vacancies in Europe.Q: Well, now,
                    were you tagged as a Russian specialist?</p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, yes. The assignment actually fit my capabilities [laughter].</p>

                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: I ended up at the 513th Military Intelligence Group, located outside of
                    Frankfurt, where I was involved in overt, as opposed to covert, collection of
                    intelligence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this part of the Army Security Agency?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: No, the ASA had listening posts everywhere. This was different.</p>

                <p>McCARTHY: I'm not sure how much ...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take a rather blithe view. I was in the Air Force

                <p>McCARTHY: January 31, 1968.</p>

                        or... while you were...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, the 1967 Six-Day War. Troops were put on alert. So that was a
                    crisis. There were always the drawdowns for Vietnam. Which was a preoccupation
                    of the army at the time. I remember one discussion I had with my colonel. We
                    were talking about Vietnam... I was very opposed to the war... and we had this
                    very frank discussion. We disagreed, and he closed by saying, “Mac, I just wish
                    you could see it for yourself. You'd think differently.” And that's the last
                    time that I ever mentioned the subject again, for the rest of my career. Please
                    don't do may a favor and let me see for myself, I thought. [laughter].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter] Did you get a feel for, there was talk of sort
                        of a hollow Army because we were taking so much out and sending to Vietnam
                        at the height of our engagement in Vietnam...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you observe our military capabilities from your
                        perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: I had a limited perspective. I wasn't with troops in the field. We'd
                    have a monthly alerts, and we'd get our battle gear and be prepared to do move.
                    But I had no sense of overall preparedness.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for the state of morale. Was the
                        enlisted man not being very happy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: There were a number of enlisted people who were not very happy. The
                    officers that I was with, a bunch of people my age who were either working on
                    the same base or close to where I was, socialized together. Most of us came
                    away, having respect for the military, for how they incorporated so many
                    different people from different backgrounds, trained them, and formed them into
                    functioning units. Somehow the Army made it work. On the other hand, we also
                    relished the sheer craziness of the system, and constantly traded the latest
                    anecdotes. So I guess my take was a bit of catch-22 theater of the absurd,
                    concern that I was going to get killed in Vietnam, and the feeling of doing
                    something worthwhile for my country. Finally there was this opportunity to be in
                    Germany, to travel and see all different sides of life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Getting out in Germany and all this, did that sort of whet
                        your appetite?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: Oh, yes. Frankfurt was a convenient jump-off point for travel, and
                    there were great advantages to living in the city. At that time there was an
                    area of Frankfurt called Sachsenhausen, where the specialty was the traditional
                    Frankfurt alcoholic apple wine. It was bubbly and a bit tart. The little,
                    informal restaurants had long tables with benches on each side. Old tables and
                    benches, scarred wood. You'd squeeze into a seat on one of the benches, with
                    other patrons on each side. You'd literally feel people pressing your elbows in.
                    And you'd order this apple wine and food and there would be an accordionist and
                    sometimes there would be a fiddler and people would just talk to each other and
                    link arms and sing German songs. It was the only place in Frankfurt, which was a
                    rather cold city, where everyone relaxed and chatted easily with strangers
                    across a table. I used to go there all the time. It was my own German language
                    school, and gradually you began to feel you were part of the Frankfurt
                    community. You lived there, rather than just being stationed there.</p>
                <p>I remember one instance, for example. There was a problem with my Volkswagen. I
                    took it in to a garage, and when the service guy turned around, it was a felloI
                    had been talking to the night before across the table in Sachsenhausen. “Oh, how
                    are you?” He took off his blue jacket, went outside, took me in the car and
                    said, “You know what you really want to do is just get it into second gear, jam
                    on the brake, give it gas, jam on the brake, give it gas, jam on the brake...
                    You had some dirt on the drum...” The car ran like a charm after that
                    personalized five-minute session. That is one very small experience, but it
                    illustrates how one begins to feel surprisingly connected to a foreign culture
                    and a foreign place, even though you realize that culture is different from your
                    own in many ways.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got out of the Army, this would have been again,
                        '68</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: '68 in January.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you going to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: I took what they called a “European out,” which means you were released
                    from the Army in Europe, and the Army agreed to pay transportation back to the
                    U.S. if you returned within a year. So I spent a year in Europe. While I was
                    still in the Army, I had applied to study French language and literature at the
                    Sorbonne and that's where I went. There was a marvelous place called the Cit�
                    Universitaire, which was very like an American campus, on the periphery of the
                    city. There were no classes just residence halls, and many countries owned
                    “houses.” There was an American house, a German house, etc. You had your own
                    room, and there was a little cafeteria, and you had access to all kinds of
                    events that the various national houses would put on. I studied with a group of
                    students preparing to be French teachers. That was for four or five months. That
                    was the year of what the French call “the events.”</p>

                <p>McCARTHY: Yes sir.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were in Paris.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: I was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me about it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: I'd never seen those enormous, organized street demonstrations before.
                    Seeing these 20-, 30-, 40-thousand strong demonstrations rolling along those
                    large boulevards, with marshals and linked arms and chants, was a new experience
                    for me. The whole city seemed to rock and vibrate. Just observing how crowds get
                    organized was interesting. I remember being in one demonstration for the
                    experience and then wanting to leave, and I discovered there was a coercive
                    element there... The marshals did not want you to leave. I left, but it was
                    definitely not a free-form demonstration, with people joining and leaving as it
                    moved through the city. And there was the CRS, a type of riot police.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were tough.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: They were tough. Lots of ex-paratroopers from Algeria supposedly. And
                    there was another unit composed of people who were bureaucrats most of the time.
                    The word was they were angry people working behind desks who would be mobilized
                    when extra police were needed. They were issued khaki clothing, shields, batons,
                    and served as supplementary riot police. They went crazy when they got out into
                    the street, as though a chance to mix it up was just what they had been waiting
                    for.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might want to explain what the issues were. This was a
                        very famous spring of '68...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: There were a lot of issues mixed together. It started off as an issue
                    of university autonomy, curriculum reform, and visitor rules. One of the rectors
                    struck a militant. There was a question of whether the authorities had the right
                    to come onto university grounds. But that issue quickly evolved into questioning
                    the whole structure of French society - equality under the law, class
                    differences, and workers struck for better wages. For a period of time waiters
                    on the Left Bank called you “comrade” when you went in to get a cup of coffee. I
                    drove to Normandy at the time with a buddy who was out of the Army, and there
                    were red flags flying over the factories along the way. The idea was to break
                    down class barriers and have a society based on equality. There were various
                    public fora where this question was discussed.</p>
                <p>For example, there was what was called an open forum in the Odeon Theater, a very
                    nice theater on the Left Bank. Thousands of young people were packed into this
                    theater for a public discussion. There would be somebody down on the stage, and
                    somebody far up in the balcony would yell out a comment or a question and he'd
                    preface it with something like, “Mr. President, or Mr. Chairman...” Then the guy
                    on the stage would say, “There are no chairmen here, there are no presidents...
                    we are all equal.” And then he'd go and put a little addendum to that, “But, in
                    order that we can hear each other and we don't all yell at once, I - not a
                    chairman, not a president - will call on people individually.” You could see new
                    ranks and status divisions emerging before your eyes and could see right away
                    that this fantastical idea wasn't going to work.</p>
                <p>But the movement went far beyond students. At one point the whole public
                    transportation system of Paris stopped. So you have people driving in from
                    outside the city and you'd hitchhike with them if you wanted to get anywhere.
                    Some of those were sentimentally in favor of the students, and some of them were
                    not. As a foreign student, I heard all sides. While waiters were calling you
                    comrade on the Left Bank, you'd have counter-demonstrations around the Arc de
                    Triomphe, with cars whizzing by with the French tricolour flapping out the
                    windows. As the situation deteriorated, the big question was what DeGaulle would
                    do. He gave an address to the nation, which was rather insipid, and then he was
                    absent from the city for a while, as people speculated where he was and whether
                    he was going to resign. He actually went to Baden Baden to talk to French
                    troops. And that same time I had driven to Luxembourg to meet other army
                    friends. On the way back, we stopped for gas, and the fellow who owned the gas
                    station in this little town invited us into his living room to watch DeGaulle
                    give his second speech, and it was very strong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was in uniform, too, wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: As I recall he was in uniform.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I think he put on this uniform.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, the details are really vague to me now, but our friend at the gas
                    station was very buoyed up by that strong speech.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were doing this, were you pointed towards
                        anything more than just a sort of absorb experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: No. I wasn't oriented to any particular goal. I wanted to stay in
                    Europe. It was like a huge feast, like a table full of tasty items. Paris was a
                    place to perch and a place to learn. I went to class, I did my assignments, I
                    learned French. But it was also just a great way to live in a different culture,
                    another society, meet the French, visit their homes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well after this year in Europe, what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Well, after the year in Europe...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, Bob, before you get to that, how did from your
                        perspective... did the demonstrations all sort of peter out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: At a certain point, I left France. There were student-faculty meetings
                    on reorganizing the university system, and I participated in some of those. One
                    of our teachers who had studied in the United States was particularly interested
                    in the views of foreign students. It was interesting enough, but I wanted to get
                    on with my other plans. I went down to Spain for four weeks and then over to
                    Morocco, and then back up to France, and then hitchhiked around the British
                    Isles, then down to Greece, and returned to Germany via Yugoslavia. That took
                    about six months. I had a tent and a Volkswagen with a bunch of books in the
                    back. There were camping sites all around Europe, and you were constantly
                    bumping into people from different cultures. I noticed that New York ethnic
                    neighborhoods were often reflections of the original in Europe - fragments
                    struck from the European block. You could see the relationships. So I didn't
                    stay for the end. They even had some of us in...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came back about '69?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>?McCARTHY: Yes, I came back... just before Christmas of '68.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: [laughter] I didn't know what to do. I experienced significant reverse
                    culture shock after that independent, multicultural experience. (End of
                    tape)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, you said you had this feeling of independence.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, but you know, friends - good friends - didn't really want to hear
                    Bob McCarthy's musings on life. I mean, they wanted to hear your 35 seconds on
                    Europe and what have you, but then were happy to move on to what was going on in
                    the present. I knew I had to get a job. I applied for a couple of teaching
                    positions and didn't get them. Then I tried employment agencies, and ultimately
                    wound up teaching speed reading for a while. At some point I decided I needed to
                    go back to school for teacher education credits so I'd have a certificate. So I
                    got a job driving a New York City cab for a year, and I went to night classes at
                    City College.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about driving a cab? How does that work? One knows
                        that you have to purchase your seal or whatever it is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: If you own the cab, you purchase the medallion. Not if you're a driver,
                    working for a company.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You just work for a company.McCARTHY: The company
                        purchases the seal, the medallion. You just show up to drive one of the
                        cabs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about finding your way around the city? Did you know
                        it that well already, or did you have to take courses?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, you had an exam. It was rather demanding. There were ten questions
                    on the exam, like, “Where is the Empire State Building?” “Where is Yankee
                    Stadium?” “Where is the Battery?” You had these ten questions and several weeks
                    to study for them. And then you went into the exam room and were asked those
                    same ten questions and were expected to know the answers. But there were people
                    saying, “What's number 4? Jeez, this is a hard test. What did you get for number
                    5?” [laughter] So it's no wonder people get lost in New York. You didn't really
                    have to know anything. I think it's a great deal better now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, because I know if you want to be a cabby in

                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: And I think it's better now in New York too. But then it was... it
                    certainly wasn't...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who's buried in Grant's tomb?McCARTHY: Yes, who's buried
                        in Grant's tomb? That's the level of the questions asked but no duck and no
                        hundred dollars. On the job you did learn a lot about getting around New
                        York because your passengers knew the route from A to B, and you'd remember.
                        And other cabbies would know things. I was an honest cabby. I took people
                        where they wanted to go and I felt good about it. But there were lots of
                        drivers who didn't... Cabbies did not like fares to Queens because they
                        wanted to work Midtown Manhattan because the tips were better. So a lady
                        would get in the cab and say, “I'd like to go to Queens.” And the cabby
                        would say, “I'm sorry ma'am, but did you see what the letter is on top of
                        the cab?” “No, I didn't.” “Well, take a look.” And the passenger would look
                        and it would be, say, M453. “M is foManhattan,” the cabby would say. “You
                        need a Q cab for Queens.” Unfortunately there weren't any Q cabs, but it
                        would be one way for a cabby not to go to Queens.</hi>

                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Halfway through my cab-driving experience, I decided I needed to get
                    out, so I applied to American University in International Relations, got a
                    fellowship there, and started in 1970.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And how long were you at American University?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Three years.</p>

                <p>McCARTHY: Well, in part it led to employment with the Development Education and
                    Training Research Institute (DETRI). It was a contracting arm of American
                    University and had a contract with the U.S. Agency for International
                    Development. For several years I worked there, interviewing USAID grantees
                    before they returned home after training in the United States. They completed a
                    questionnaire - how good the program was, how relevant, strong points, weak
                    points, integration into American culture, changes in perceptions, blah, blah,
                    blah, blah. After that questionnaire, we, the interviewers, conducted individual
                    interviews for thirty or forty minutes. It was a chance to elaborate on the
                    questionnaire, to get below the surface, and really understand what was
                    happening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the American U. courses there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Very good. In fact, I was a little surprised it was so good. You had a
                    good mix of students, for one thing. In the graduate school there were people
                    who were full-time students like me and others who were employed in the CIA,
                    Defense Department, State, or non-governmental organizations. So you constantly
                    had this real world input into the classroom, and that, I think, kept the
                    instruction on a rather high level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And many of the instructors were people working in the
                        real world, too, weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Most of them were full-time faculty. At that time universities had not
                    embraced adjunct faculty the way they have now. Even among the full-time faculty
                    there were professors with recent experience in government.</p>

                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Well I'd always thought about it, but obviously I wasn't thinking about
                    it hard enough to inform myself seriously.</p>

                        area... were you picking up things about the Foreign Service?McCARTHY: Yes,
                        I did pick up things about the Foreign Service, and there were people who
                        really wanted to make the Foreign Service their career. My career planning
                        was not that developed, though I did think I might take the entrance exam at
                        some point</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you take the oral?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall anything about the oral?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes. It was a good cop/bad cop/friendly guy in the middle scenario. The
                    examiners asked you to pick some area of U.S. history or foreign policy, and
                    they talked to you about it for half an hour or so. They asked questions and
                    follow-ups. As part of the process, they tried to nettle you, or rattle you,
                    with the hostile member of the trio being particularly aggressive. They wanted
                    to see, I think, how you conducted yourself. Clearly, you were not entirely your
                    natural self during the interview. I remember after the oral, the lead examiner
                    said two things that I thought were a bit peculiar. He said “Bob, you passed,
                    but I want you to know one thing...” Then he basically said that if I was coming
                    to the Foreign Service as a member of the intelligence community, the State
                    Department would find out. I thought that was a very strange thing to say. Then
                    he said he noticed I had no sense of humor and hoped it wouldn't be a problem
                    for me. Of course, throughout the oral, I was repressing any trace of humor so
                    that I'd appear appropriately serious about being a diplomat. [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter] McCARTHY: Anyway that was the nature of the
                        exam. It wasn't one of these in box exercises.</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, when did you come in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: I came in in 1973. I had taken the exam in 1971 or so. At that time,
                    being on the roster was like having a terrific insurance policy. You had three
                    years, I believe, within which you were eligible to enter the Foreign Service.
                    They called periodically to say there was a new class of officers beginning at
                    such and such a time, and if you were still doing your studies, you would say
                    you were not free but were still interested.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was a Ph.D. in the offing at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: A Ph.D. was in the offing, and I passed my Ph.D. exams and whatnot. I'd
                    intended to use the database at this DETRI organization where I was working to
                    do an analysis of foreign-student attitudes. However, we lost the AID contract,
                    and the database with it. Probably, if I'd really, really wanted to, I could
                    have figured out a way to do the dissertation.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '73 you came in. How was your A100 course? Do you have any
                        impressions of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: I thought it was okay. State was faced with the challenge of bringing
                    together all these people from so many different backgrounds, and giving them a
                    sense of belonging to this organization, and a basic introduction to what the
                    organization does and how it functions, and getting a little look at us in the
                    process. I thought it was fine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And when they came around, where did you want to go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: I wanted to stay in Washington because I still entertained ideas of
                    finishing a Ph.D., and I liked the idea of educational and cultural affairs. So
                    I went to the Bureau of Education and Cultural Affairs in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there the offing to go into the state department
                        Foreign Service or the information agency side of things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: I don't think I even realized at that time that there were Foreign
                    Service officers in USIA. I knew about USIA's touring exhibit program for the
                    USSR, but my knowledge stopped there. I had even been accepted as a
                    Russian-speaking guide on an exhibit but it was canceled. When a Department
                    representative came to speak to us about the Foreign Service aAmerican
                    University, we were told the two cones where chances were besthe most openings -
                    were admin and consular. I selected consular.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, where'd you go? You say you got an educational
                        exchange...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, I was in the office of Private Cooperation for a year and a half
                    or so, and then in the Office of East European programs. The office of Private
                    Cooperation was an experimental office, designed to stimulate private support of
                    exchange programs and encourage public-private partnerships.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that go anywhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: What I concluded was that you really need a specific project, with
                    which a given corporation or foundation, etc. wants to associate its name. This
                    idea of reaching out generally wasn't too productive during the time I was
                    there. But I was impressed with how much information was available on
                    foundations, how many small niche foundations there are, and the extent of
                    philanthropy in the U.S. It's a little difficult to cover all the information
                    and tap into the right source of support, but the potential is immense. The
                    non-governmental sector in the United States also impressed me. After I was in
                    the office for two months or so, I was seconded to escort the mayor of
                    Leningrad, and mayor of Kharkiv, and a Soviet exchange bureaucrat around the
                    United States. It was a coast-to-coast trip covering a dozen or so cities to
                    explore possibilities of U.S.-USSR sister-city relationships. Before that trip,
                    I hadn't realized the extent to which these international visitors' councils,
                    world affairs councils, and other organizations in American cities have the
                    capacity to organize significant events, including hosting a rather important
                    delegation from abroad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went with the mayor of Leningrad, how did you
                        find that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: It was intriguing. He was educated, smart, perceptive, extremely funny
                    in a sardonic way, and very different from one of the other members of the
                    delegation who was more skeptical about things American and much more dogmatic.
                    The mayor of Leningrad would sort of set him straight. I remember going out to a
                    pollution control system in a small California city. And by the way, the level
                    of development in rural America would simply bloSoviets away. As you know, if
                    you were out in the provinces of the Soviet Union, you probably had a muddy
                    road, very few basic provisions, limited access to information, etc. Any way at
                    his pollution control plant, the mayor of Kharkiv made some disparaging comment
                    to his fellow travelers. I just heard it; the comment was not directed to me.
                    The mayor of Leningrad rounded on him, telling him not to “tell fairy tales,”
                    and advising him to pay attention to what he was seeing. “It was also
                    fascinating to observe how the delegation tried to project a positive image, and
                    how unaware they were of some of the social customs. Sometimes the faux pas were
                    really big. At times a Soviet embassy officer spent some time with the
                    delegation and would have to intervene, in one case leaping in to interrupt an
                    anti-Semitic joke a delegation member was just about to tell to his
                    Jewish-American host. It was one fascinating vignette after another.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time, were you getting any training as
                        consular, did you know where you wanted to go?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: That became a big problem. After the Office of Private Cooperation, I
                    went into another CU office responsible for exchanges with the Soviet Union and
                    Eastern Europe. So, by the time I went overseas, I had spent absolutely no time
                    doing consular work during my first three years in the Department. An officer
                    was basically on probation and had five years to cross the threshold and get
                    tenure in the Foreign Service. So when my file came up for tenure consideration,
                    my one-year in consular work would be compared to four years by others, my two
                    years against their five years in several consular assignments. So, I was
                    tenured in the Foreign Service by the skin of my teeth, at the very end of my
                    five-year probationary period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you went to Belgrade, from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: I went to Belgrade from 1977 to 1979.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador when you got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Ambassador Eagleburger.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Larry and I took Serbian together.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Oh, God.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We both went out there in '62.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: This is when he was involved with Macedonia and the aftermath of the
                    earthquake?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. I went there, too. I was the officer who took a MASH
                        group in the Seventh Army there, and Larry took engineers afterwards.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes. Was it right after the quake?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, well I was new to the consular section. I was there
                        the next morning. A group came down... the British, and I think one or two
                        other consular officers of other embassies... we took a convoy and went down
                        there. What was the state of our relations when you got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: Relations were pretty good. As you remember, Yugoslavia was a big
                    member of the non-aligned movement. It was communist, but had its own third-way
                    house brand of communism. Yugoslavia wasn't in the Warsaw Pact. It was lying
                    astride the Adriatic, blocking any of the Warsaw Pact access to the
                    Mediterranean. One would have to go through the Dardanelles, past Turkey, a NATO
                    member. It was liberal, compared to other communist states at that time. There
                    was a lot more individual freedom; Yugoslavs could travel. As you remember,
                    Yugoslavs knew what life was like outside. They had relatives, whom they could
                    visit. Tourists could come to Yugoslavia and travel all around. Embassy
                    personnel didn't need diplomatic notes requesting permission to travel outside
                    the capital. So, relations were good. They were soured periodically, often by a
                    dual national case. You know, someone would come with dual citizenship and would
                    be drafted into the Yugoslav army while visiting relatives. But, in general, the
                    relations were good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of consular work were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: I started off on non-immigrant visas and federal benefits and then
                    added immigrant visa work. From time to time I was involved in cases involving
                    American citizens. I think the consular officer's position is probably the
                    hardest in an embassy.Q: Well, you tell a lot of people “no.”</p>
                <p>McCARTHY: You tell a lot of people “No.” In the space of a couple of minutes
                    you're making critical decisions about their lives. You have to apply the law,
                    of course, and the applicant has to convince you he'll return after his visit.
                    You can't become cynical and refuse everybody or be a bleeding heart and believe
                    everybody's story. You get lied to a lot, so it is easy to get jaded.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you picking up any feel for the Yugoslav ethnic
                        divisions and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes. There would be incidents at soccer games. People would tell ethnic
                    jokes at the expense of others. You'd see the way the Albanians would be treated
                    by many Serbs when they're working on the street cleaning crews. My wife and I
                    traveled around Yugoslavia almost every weekend, went to every part of
                    Yugoslavia, except the very southeastern corner of Macedonia. We saw differences
                    and some animosities, but it was far from being a seething cauldron bound to
                    erupt. People talked about the birth rate in Kosovo and the subsidies for
                    Kosovo, and you'd go up to Slovenia and the Slovenians would complain that they
                    were carrying the rest of Yugoslavia on their backs. Tito kept a lid on
                    everything of course, and you were sent to prison on Goli Otok for nationalism.
                    Still, a demagogue was needed to make those low-level feelings burst into
                    violence. There was a certain level of prosperity when we were there, so people
                    were not worrying about a shrinking pie at that time. So there was no great need
                    for scapegoats.</p>

                    She went to school in California, graduated from Berkeley, was a health
                    nutritionist, and then came to Washington to work for the Pan American Health
                    Organization. We're both folk dancers, very into ethnic music, and that's how we
                    met. In fact that was one of the reasons I wanted to go to Yugoslavia. Some
                    wives might not see Belgrade as very alluring for their first overseas
                    assignment. Marjie was really positive. For her it was the ideal place to
                    go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If you talk about ethnic things, just the tribal qualities
                        there are wonderful.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Absolutely. And folk festivals, and little off-the-beaten-path places
                    where you can find traditional crafts still applied to daily life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any particularly memorable consular cases that
                        you...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes. There was one automobile accident on the Autoput, the main highway
                    from Greece through Yugoslavia to Austria. A lot of gastarbeiters, the guest
                    workers in Europe, used to drive to and from Turkey that way. It was a long
                    drive, they would get sleepy, and the cops said they would find bricks on the
                    floor of a car by the accelerator. It was a form of cruise control; the brick
                    helped keep a steady pace. Anyway, there was an accident involving an American
                    and other people of several nationalities. I went to the morgue to corroborate
                    the American citizen's identity. You'd think that you could look at photos and
                    then identify the body. But by the time you factor in the embalming fluid,
                    changed hair styles, passing years, etc., I found I could not be sure. A
                    relative of the American came to Belgrade and made a positive identification.
                    The body was shipped to the parents in Germany, and it turned out it was the
                    wrong one. It was so anxiety producing for the poor family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, God, oh, yes.McCARTHY: The family and I talked on the
                        phone several times, and ultimately things were straightened out. Besides
                        the human tragedy involved, it was clear that simple things are not that
                        simple. They're not so cut and dried. Here's someone who knows the person,
                        looks at the bodies in the morgue and says “Yes, that's her.” And it's
                        not.</hi>

                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: And the prison cases were sad too. The “representative payee” cases I
                    always found very interesting. Americans of Yugoslav origin or maybe Yugoslavs
                    who had worked in the United States often retired in Yugoslavia and received
                    their social security payments. In some cases they were not competent to manage
                    their own affairs, so a representative payee would receive the check on behalf
                    of the beneficiary. One of us had to travel out and make sure that the person
                    was alive, that the person was being treated well, and that as far as you could
                    see, that money was going toward that person's well-being. These trips were
                    often to “behind God's back” (”Boga za ledja,” as the Serbs say). Someone in the
                    village caf� would direct you to a remote area, and you'd walk out into a huge
                    cornfield and yell out “Milane.” And sooner or later Milan would answer back.
                    He'd take you to the house. You would see the representative payee and talk with
                    everybody. It was a small window on remote village life that you otherwise
                    simply would not see.</p>

                <p>McCARTHY: [speaks Serbian] Domachi, domachi je.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember there was a town called Laboyno, and all these
                        people wanted to go, in those days, to the Canadian Expo in Montreal. These
                        are people who'd never been out of Macedonia and all of a sudden they wanted
                        to go see a World's Fair in Montreal. You got good plane tickets, but none
                        of them ever went to see the thing. What a mess.</hi>

                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, you definitely had that. And the hardships they would endure just
                    to get there for the interview impressed one how hardy the Yugoslavs were in
                    those days. Someone would be sitting in front of you, and you happen to know
                    there was a major blizzard in their region. They have a baby with them, and you
                    ask how they got to Belgrade. “Well,” they might start off, “We walked five
                    hours to,” you know, some town... where they got a bus and then got a train.
                    They would tell you all this, not expecting any particular recognition, but just
                    recounting it in a matter-of-fact way. In a number of those remote places, their
                    contact in the United States was often someone who had a restaurant, and a
                    number of “waiters” just happened to be going on visit. All the while you are
                    saying “no” to all these people, they were sitting there heavily armed. They
                    probably didn't have a metal detector when you were there, but we installed one
                    in the late 1970s. The first few days, before word got around, there would be
                    this pile of guns and knives and daggers in the consular section...</p>

                    these people and they're sitting over there armed to the teeth.</p>

                        embassy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Eagleburger was great. He was politically astute, analytical, and could
                    cut through all the excessive information. And he was funny, funny as hell. You
                    remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: Could be witty in a sardonic way, in a whimsical way. Very good with
                    people. Relaxed them right away. You'd go to a meeting with Ambassador
                    Eagleburger and somebody in the foreign minister and he was great. Later, when I
                    was in Montenegro he came for the opening of the American cultural center, and
                    the Montenegrins loved him. “Larry, Larry,” they kept calling him. The head of
                    the foreign relations department in Montenegro pointed with pride to a picture
                    on his wall. There was an earthquake down in Montenegro and we sent in Hercules
                    planes loaded with emergency supplies. The picture is of a plane being unloaded
                    at Titograd Airport. The head of the foreign relations department is standing
                    there with his hands in his pocket, watching, and Eagleburger has his sleeves
                    rolled up, and is offloading boxes. And of course, everyone kids him about this,
                    “You're standing there with your hands in your pockets and the American
                    ambassador is working.” The Montenegrins had a reputation for being very lazy.
                    Matter of fact, during the earthquake, they said, “The Montenegrins are really
                    rolling their sleeves up now.” “Oh, they 'e finally getting down to work?” “No,
                    they're lining up to get inoculations.” To make a long story short, Eagleburger
                    was a terrific ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. His wife, Marlene, started out as a consular
                        assistant in my consular section.McCARTHY: Also great. Talked to everybody
                        in the embassy. Great for morale. No nonsense, really practical.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. You said while you were there you opened up a
                        culture center?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, we had American centers in every one of the republics except
                    Montenegro. They wanted a center, and Ambassador Eagleburger thought that we
                    should be represented everywhere. This was our way of getting our message out to
                    the Yugoslavs and hearing back from them. We had to finance it out of embassy
                    resources. The embassy wanted someone from the existing staff to go down there,
                    and I volunteered. I took the assignment as part of a transfer from State to
                    USIA. By that time I realized that USIA work was more to my liking and was where
                    I would be most effective. So Marj and I went down there, and for the first year
                    I worked out of an apartment, on the second floor of a private house.</p>

                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: It was called Titograd then. It now has its old name of Podgoritsa
                    again.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The main street was Marshala Tita.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Always.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Marshala Tita, indeed. We belonged to a folk dance group in Belgrade,
                    and we used to sing songs about the marshal.</p>
                <p>Druze Tito, mi tiSe kumemo. Mi ti se kunemo.</p>
                <p>“Comrade Tito, we dedicate ourselves to you.” American diplomats in a Yugoslav
                    folk dance group singing songs in honor of a communist!</p>
                <p>So, anyway, yes, we lived in Titograd and at the same time we were constructing a
                    center. My job was to go out and meet everybody, establish contact with all the
                    major institutions, the key players in Montenegro, and oversee construction of
                    the center - air-conditioner circuits, furniture orders, talking with
                    construction crews and the city housing administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Montenegrins a different breed of cat?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, in some ways they were a different breed of cat. They had a very
                    traditional mountainous clan culture, where your name and family history were
                    very important. People knew what clan your were from, and every clan had a
                    reputation. Ideally, though not always in fact of course, the culture put a
                    premium on honor and your word as bond. You were supposed to be courageous and
                    speak your mind, and there was a tradition of scholarship. An interesting blend.
                    And Montenegrins are very tall people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hawks, beak nose.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, yes. There the custom of the corzo the evening stroll. You
                    remember all those cities would have central streets blocked off, and people
                    would walk up and down the streets, greeting each other during the corzo. There
                    was, not exactly a swagger, but a confidence that the Montenegrins demonstrated
                    in just the way they walked around that would strike visitors. After you lived
                    there for a while, you sort of got used to it. But someone would come to visit
                    from Belgrade and say, “It's like being in West Side Story or something.”</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>So the point, coming back to your question, is that the Montenegrins didn't, even
                    thougMontenegro was a small republic, have any inferiority complexes. They had a
                    lot of contact with the outside world. When they were a kingdom, you know, they
                    had a capital up in the mountains in Cetinje, and we had a representative there
                    until the end of WWI. We re-established that relationship with the American
                    Center, our first official American presence since that time. The Montenegrins
                    took this as perfectly natural. They weren't defensive, they weren't afraid,
                    They weren't trying to put you down. We were just... equals... “We are a great
                    people, you are a great people.” That was sort of implicit in everything that
                    happened.</p>
                <p>Montenegrins were also extremely sociable and hospitable. So a meeting in the
                    office... and in those were the days of “rakia” in the morning was very social.
                    In my book closet I had Wild Turkey bourbon, homemade rakia, Johnny Walker
                    scotch, and several other choices. It was considered really bad form if somebody
                    came to visit you, even if it was 11 in the morning or 10:30 in the morning, not
                    to offer coffee and a drink. You know, “But what will you have to drink?” The
                    Serbs had some of that sociability too, but it was even more pronounced in
                    Montenegro. You'd go into somebody's office on an appointment, and you'd be
                    talking to the director of, let's say, a museum. You'd be talking to him and
                    somebody else would come in. Rather than say, “I'll be with you in a minute,”
                    the museum director would wave him on in, and it would be sort of like the
                    Johnny Carson Show. You know, the new guest comes in and sits a little closer to
                    the host. The guy who comes in to fix the radiator comments on the cultural
                    exchange program, gives me suggestions. I would feel free to tell him how to fix
                    the radiator if I wanted. Other people arrive. Pretty soon you'll have six or
                    seven people there, from all different walks of life, and everybody's business
                    being conducted at the same time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did the culture center take?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: It took very well. There were some people who were against the whole
                    idea. That was considered one of the most “Soviet” of the Yugoslav republics.
                    There were some old guard there who didn't like it, but by and large people saw
                    the center as a window to the outside world, as recognizing Montenegro, as
                    bringing in lots of ways in which people could learn English and could be
                    exposed to cultural influences from outside, as educational. We would have film
                    evenings, we would have lectures. We would bring in Fulbrighters to talk to
                    teachers. We'd have different events in the Center, and we'd take exhibits on
                    the road. You know, you used to be able to throw those collapsible exhibits into
                    the back of the station wagon and drive up to some mountain town and set up that
                    exhibit, using special self-standing frames. We'd bring in lecturers on
                    everything from arms control to urban planning and solar energy, and the
                    Montenegrins would be very interested. You know, they're intellectually very
                    curious. They have a tradition of education and scholarship, and we had very
                    good discussions. And how could I even have not said this at the very beginning,
                    the wonderful, wonderful local staff! We had the luxury of hiring from scratch
                    and the top FSN there, Hilda Zakraijsek, was just superb. Very sensitive, well
                    educated, bilingual, a self-starter, lots of ideas, and she was committed to
                    improving conditions in Montenegro. Before I hired her, she already had a
                    reputation in the republic, had accompanied delegations from their bank to
                    international negotiations several times, and had been one of the top English
                    teachers in the republic. So that was very good, too, and I guess she brought in
                    a constituency. So I think the center was generally well received.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a University of Titograd?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: There was. Q: Did this amount to much, or...</p>
                <p>McCARTHY: It wasn't one of the best universities in the country, but it was
                    important for Titograd, yes. We had Fulbrighters there who had an impact. You
                    had some English language people who were very good. It was mainly, as I recall,
                    more a technically oriented university.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the fact that you had a hunk of the shoreline, you
                        know for summer traffic, did that make much of an impact?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: Oh, yes. The Montenegrins had an expression. If anything went wrong, if
                    there was a complaint - for example, in the summer the water doesn't get up to
                    the second floor, the heating has a problem, or whatever it happened to be -
                    they'd say, [speaks Montenegrin] “Zato more je blizu” “But, for all that, the
                    sea is close,” meaning, there's a compensation: 45 minutes over the mountain,
                    and you're at this glorious seacoast. So how could anyone really have grounds
                    for complaint, when you consider that?!! There was a tourism industry on the
                    coast, [laughter] but the service was a little alien to some of the Montenegrins
                    at that time. It's the flip side of the coin of this clan mentality and emphasis
                    on dignity, and equality, two people speaking as equals. The idea that tourists
                    could put up their hands and say, “I want you to come here” or beckon with the
                    finger would really rub them the wrong way in some of these establishments. So
                    it was a bit of a tough haul to inculcate that ethos or service to tourists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about immigration? Was there much of a connection with
                        Americans, you know, with immigration and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, a number of people had relatives overseas. There was quite a bit
                    of communication back and forth. Quite a bit of visiting. There was the ferry to
                    Italy too, from Bar to Bari. Some relatives abroad still managed to get out of
                    touch. I remember one description of an uncle coming back with this big chest of
                    hard-to-get tools (in his day) that were sold everywhere by the time that he got
                    back with these things. He had a flash frozen picture of deficit items in his
                    mind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there during the earthquake?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: No, I was in Belgrade during the earthquake. Another officer and I went
                    down there in a Land Rover to try to find information on Americans who were In
                    Montenegro the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a rather quick recovery from the
                        earthquake?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, fortunately it happened on the weekend, and as you see with all
                    these earthquakes, there are pancaked buildings and everybody wonders what
                    happened with the construction standards. You know, these floors just collapse
                    on one another. Their recovery was pretty quick, although you still saw some of
                    the ruins around some time afterwards. The roadways were disrupted,
                    communications were disrupted, but they patched it up.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there ship visits while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, but not to Montenegrin ports. There were ship visits farther up
                    the coast. The Navy, as I recall, was experimenting with having our ships
                    repaired during port calls, and having Yugoslavs working on the ships. As I
                    remember, we were satisfied with the work. They were clearly putting very good
                    people on that. An aircraft carrier came to the port of Split, and my wife and I
                    happened to be out on the island of Khvar, opposite Split. We were sitting at an
                    outdoor caf�, and had just ordered from the waiter. The waiter's friend came by
                    and said, “There's a ship visit... unbelievable... 5,000 American sailors, etc.”
                    He did make it sound pretty interesting. Anyway, our waiter left then and there
                    to take in the ship visit. [laughter] It was a big deal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, it was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: And the consular workup...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think we are probably getting as close to a good time to

                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Fine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: The date would be '81.</p>
                <p>

                        things were working out for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: I was going to Moscow. I was very enthusiastic about it. I was going to
                    be an assistant cultural affairs officer there. In those days, those assignments
                    were taken very seriously. My public affairs officer in Belgrade was very
                    supportive. He was an old Moscow hand...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Ray Benson.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, boy. Well Ray Benson, we had a long interview with
                        him. He was what is known as a “red diaper baby.”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: His family had gone back to the Soviet Union as a
                        kid.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Right. He also spent a long time in Zagreb.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. He was in Belgrade when I was there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes that was his first time, I guess. Then he came back... When I was
                    in Titograd, Ray was my PAO in Belgrade. Anyway, he was very supportive. He had
                    been PAO in Moscow, while I was on the Soviet desk in the Office of East
                    European Programs in CU, so I had known him a bit from that, and he knew that I
                    knew something about Soviet affairs. But there was an obstacle that you had to
                    overcome if you wanted to go to Moscow, and they really didn't know you. So I
                    drove up the coast and joined Ray and the current PAO there, Pic Litell, also an
                    old Soviet hand. It was a long lunch and quasi-interview, I think just to make
                    sure I didn't have three heads or something. That worked out fine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, so we'll pick this up in 1981 when you're off to
                        Moscow.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Okay, great.</p>
                <p>

                <p>***</p>
                <p>This is an interview with Bob McCarthy. Well, 1951, Moscow.</p>
                <p>McCARTHY: 1981.Q: 1981, my God, yes.</p>
                <p>McCARTHY: I do have a beard, it's true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter] Okay, 1981. Have we gone into how you got that
                        job?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, we did. I had just finished an interview with the current PAO, I
                    believe, and with my Yugoslavia PAO. We had known each other, so it was more or
                    less an audition interview. Because I hadn't been there before, it was
                    considered a tough assignment. At that time, checking off the Moscow box was one
                    of the way stations in the Foreign Service, as you know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. So you were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: I was there from 1981 to '83 in Moscow, and '83-'84 in Leningrad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the status would you say of the Soviet-American
                        relations in 1981?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Very tense. The Soviets had gone into Afghanistan in December of 1979.
                    This was the time NATO was preparing to put cruise missiles and Pershing
                    intermediate range nuclear missiles into Europe to counter the Soviet SS-20s.
                    And a couple of years later there was the KAL airliner shootdown over Kamchatka.
                    So it was a tense time. As far as our day-to-day activities, that is the
                    activities of USIA were concerned, the cultural exchange agreement, which
                    governed U.S.-USSR exchanges had lapsed because of the Soviet invasion of
                    Afghanistan. We did not want to renew those negotiations and accord the Soviets
                    the respect and additional status that that would have meant. That put a crimp
                    in a lot of what we did. Up until that time, we had sent large exhibits to the
                    Soviet Union. They had Russian-speaking guides and reached otherwise
                    inaccessible (except for short-wave broadcasts) areas of the Soviet Union.
                    Exhibits would open up for six weeks or so. They would show an aspect of
                    American life, and then the guides would answer questions about everything
                    American. It was a way to get our message out. We had major performing arts
                    groups coming through: Alvin Ailey, the Chicago Symphony, etc. They would play
                    to packed houses; All of these activities gave the lie to the Soviet caricature
                    of American society that was constantly portrayed in the Soviet media.</p>
                <p>In 1981 those activities were not possible, because they required Soviet
                    cooperation to book those groups into halls, etc. So what we tried to do was
                    continue to get our message out, but use other means. The ambassador at that
                    time, Ambassador Hartman, made Spaso House, the ambassador's residence,
                    available as an ersatz cultural center. And we would do events there, nonstop.
                    The ambassador just opened his residence completely. There was a special fund,
                    private donations maintained by the State Department that was used to defray
                    some of the costs. Large groups and small groups performed at Spaso. We would
                    have invitations sent out to the elite, the creative intelligentsia. Sometimes
                    people with political clout would come too, although they generally tried to
                    boycott those events at that particular time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you arrive there in '81?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: I arrived at the end of the summer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the lean, you might say from the office or the
                        American staff of the embassy of this new Ronald Reagan administration. It
                        must have been viewed with a certain amount of trepidation, because he had
                        been an outspoken anti-Communist, and very much to the right. What was the
                        feeling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Among the staff... well now you're asking me to go back more that 20
                    years now and try to remember those atmospherics. Those feelings didn't leap out
                    at me. I can say that.Q: Well, that's an answer.</p>
                <p>McCARTHY: But there's something else, too, I think. To a certain extent, we take
                    on the coloration of the countries we're in. And I remember somebody came to
                    talk to us about some State Department internal policy. They said when they went
                    to Turkey, everybody there was yelling and asking them questions, like “young
                    Turks.” And when they went to Moscow, people sat and absorbed it. The only thing
                    they didn't do was rhythmic applause. [laughter] That's going way too far as an
                    explanation for lack of trepidation, but there was just a little bit of that.
                    Remember also, when you were in the USSR, it was very clear what you were up
                    against. It was very clear what the nature of that society was. Nobody had any
                    doubts. A phrase like “evil empire,” I don't think, would have registered
                    particularly strongly with the staff of Embassy Moscow, the way it would in
                    Western Europe or elsewhere. It was true, though, one might have picked other
                    words. I don't recall it as a big issue; let me put it that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. You mentioned the, what was the term used, “creative
                        intelligentsia?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it there's a distinction. You know, in France you
                        talk about the intelligentsia. What did you mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: By “creative intelligentsia” I mean people who are creating works of
                    art in various ways that affect people. So, at that time for example, theater
                    was the most outspoken art form. It was less subject to censorship, less so than
                    the movies or television, which were mass vehicles. So, the playwrights who were
                    writing in the theater would come to events at Spaso House, let's say. And when
                    you went to the theater in those days, there were lines that you knew would be
                    spoken in a particular play and you waited for them. It was understood by
                    everybody that even though this play might concern a dispute between relatives,
                    the particular lines also had political meaning. Sometimes, when a particular
                    line was spoken, you could hear a pin drop in the house. Silence. And then a
                    buzz as people whispered to each other after the line.</p>
                <p>Or poetry reading would be another example of thathe creative artist affecting
                    public perceptions. There would be readings where young people would read the
                    works of Akhmatova, Pasternak, Tsvetaeva... poets who were not mainstream... but
                    represented alternatives to Socialist realism. There would be candles on the
                    wooden tables in front of the readers. There would be young people in the
                    audience. Many people's mouths would be moving as though they were praying,
                    because they knew the poetry by heart. The poetry - and the reading - was a form
                    of spiritual sustenance. So, the creative intelligentsia in the Soviet Union at
                    that time were able to represent people when they could not be represented in
                    other ways. They could not be represented through the political system. It was
                    an alternative way of expressing deeply felt beliefs, of maintaining contact
                    with important Russian traditions.</p>

                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, you had some of that. You still had demonstrations that were
                    spontaneous demonstrations that would be broken up immediately by
                    plainclothesmen. The demonstrators would try to distribute material. You had
                    magnitizdat, which is the tape recorder version of samizdat. And songs of people
                    like Vysotsky would circulate, things like that. And there were publishers
                    abroad, who published works that could not be published in the USSR, and one way
                    or another people managed to become familiar with them. Some of that material
                    would be read on the radios. The radios were extremely important. By “radios,” I
                    mean Voice of America, and Radio Liberty, which could reach large and remote
                    audiences.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have any program of getting publications into the
                        system from Moscow?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: We had American Illustrated, or “Amerika” in Russian, which was a
                    glossy magazine in the style of the old Life Magazine. It used to be in
                    over-large format the way Life was, and then it shrank down to a normal format.
                    It covered different aspects of American life, complete with color photos, and
                    the magazines were highly sought after. Like everything else, sales were
                    regulated by intergovernmental agreement. There was a ceiling on the number of
                    copies, number of exemplars per issue that you could have for sale. They would
                    be sent around the Soviet Union and be sold at kiosks. In Moscow, you could go
                    out to the kiosk when they were to be delivered, and there would be lines of
                    people waiting for their copy of Amerika. You always had returns “unsellable”
                    because there allegedly wasn't sufficient demand. But this was simply to make a
                    political point. I think we estimated that every copy of Amerika went through
                    ten readers or so. There were people who tried to save the entire collection.
                    That was one way we put ideas into the system. There was some modest... we would
                    give away books of course when we traveled... there was the Fulbright chair, de
                    facto anyway, of American history at Moscow State University. But that's really
                    more indirect. We didn't really have many ways to reach out to large numbers of
                    people directly with print publications, though there were a few other
                    specialized publications that reached small influential audiences. The radios
                    were more effective that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a different life outside of Moscow as you
                        traveled around? Exclude Leningrad at this point, but elsewhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Oh, yes, it was much more remote, much more cut off, much more
                    underdeveloped. That was one of the things that would strike Soviet visitors to
                    the United States when they came on the International Visitor Program and would
                    go out to Iowa or someplace off the beaten track. The fact that you could be
                    living out in a small town and have access, pretty much, to the same types of
                    food, the same types of clothing, the same types of appliances, the same types
                    of reading material... was a revelation. Obviously, if you were in a large city
                    with a huge library, you had more access, in the U. S. or anywhere else. But in
                    the Soviet Union roads turned to mud in the spring, you wouldn't be able to get
                    good consumer goods, you would not have access to information, etc. People came
                    into Moscow for that. Yes, there was a big difference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On these receptions at the Spaso House and all, was this a
                        place where you could talk? Did you talk?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: That was one of the great things about those events. You would find out
                    what was going on. My job there was Assistant Cultural Affairs Officer for
                    Performing Arts, and in the old days I would have been working with large
                    American groups coming in. But, as it was, I was arranging events at Spaso
                    House, and also reporting on the arts scene as partial barometer of what was
                    happening, what was being expressed. You would learn all about that. It was a
                    two-way thing. You would hear what was going on and your guests would hear from
                    you and see some element of American culture. There was a range of events. There
                    were jazz combos, for example Dave Bruebeck or the New Orleans Jazz Ensemble.
                    Jazz was considered a preeminent American art form then in Russia, and there was
                    a large jazz movement. But we had other groups as welthe New England
                    Conservatory Youth Orchestra, the Yale Russian Chorus. In addition to that, we
                    had movie showings. There was an agreement with Jack Valenti and the Motion
                    Picture Association of America that we would get first-run movies. We had 35mm
                    projectors set up in the back of the ballroom, and the agreement was that when
                    those movies came in they were chained to your wrist from the moment they got
                    there until the moment they left. No chance of a black market copy being
                    produced. But we would show those movies and you would pair off with Russian
                    guests and translate the movie as it was goincould be embarrassing dialog to
                    interpret sometimes. Those were wonderful events, really.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of feedback were you getting from the people.
                        Was this just sort of 'here it is,' we're laying it out on the table, and
                        just hoping something will happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Well, the feedback from the people was not so much “there is what we
                    are laying out for you, let's hope something happens,” although a lot of people
                    certainly did want something to happen. This was the time of what they called
                    “zastoy,” sort of a lethargy, a stall, under Brezhnev, where the leadership was
                    stagnant. There wasn't much change going on and there was a dead hand of
                    bureaucracy over everything. So burbling underneath all this, in addition to the
                    international scene, was 'what is going to happen post-Brezhnev?' People did
                    want change. They wanted some sort of reform. A lot of people who went to these
                    events and who had engaged us were simply enlarging their area of personal
                    growth. They made a decision, “Look, I can just stay back and never contact
                    foreigners or anything and sort of keep my name clear or I can decide I'm going
                    to live in a fuller more engaged way and I'm going to go to these
                    receptions.”</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>When they came to these receptions, it wasn't just that they walked up to the
                    door and entered the residence. There was a little square outside Spaso House, a
                    little park. Well before a reception or embassy event, there would be people out
                    there reading newspapers (even if it was pitch black - in other words,
                    plainclothesmen would be out there) as well as militiamen. And the officers of
                    the embassy would be out there, sort of like lifeguards on chairs. They'd see
                    somebody out there beyond the surf in a little bit of trouble, and they'd go out
                    there and sort of take that person, rescue that person so to speak... well,
                    “rescue” is too big a word... but bring that person in. “There seems to be a
                    problem with this invitation” the militiaman would say, so you'd have to go out
                    and say, “Yes, this person is on the list” and take them in. And invitations
                    would be deep-sixed if you sent them out to somebody at a particular institution
                    where they worked; they might not get there. So there were very elaborate
                    instructions for delivering invitations to particular people. You might meet a
                    contact of yours on the street corner giving six invitations for certain
                    individuals. You're always walking around with a pocket full of kopeck coins so
                    you could use the pay phones to call people. In short, people who did this made
                    a decision that they were going to expand their life and take whatever
                    consequences there might be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you observing in Soviet cultural life? Was it
                        vital, growing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, it was a very vital life. Music was of extremely high quality.
                    When they held the Tchaikovsky competition in Moscow, for example, and American
                    performers performed, they always commented on the quality of the audience.
                    Acoustics too, but mainly the quality of the audience, that feeling of
                    understanding and support from the audience. I don't pretend to understand that,
                    but performers who had good grounds for comparison would say that. Theater was
                    very lively and very interesting. Playwrights and directors were always pushing
                    the boundaries out a little bit farther. Ballet was good, not very innovative,
                    but very, very good. There were some poetry readings around, still, as I said. I
                    thought the arts scene, the cultural scene, was very alive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you notice, or was anybody remarking, because you were
                        only there for a particular time. One thinks back to pre-Hitler's Germany
                        where a really small, something like six percent, percentage of the
                        population was Jewish. It was a salt in the German stew, you might say. The
                        influence in music, in the arts, in movies, and literature was tremendous.
                        In the Soviet Union you were having this leeching away, in a way, of the
                        Jewish population into Israel and all this. Was this having an effect or was
                        anybody ever remarking about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: I didn't notice any... there was that for sure... but I didn't notice
                    any real leeching away of the creative juices. I didn't notice any wholesale
                    departure at the top of these different professions. That wasn't something that
                    I recall being remarked on.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: I don't recall that it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there when they had the Marine problem and all
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: That was a little later. I had gone, by then, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find living in the Soviet Union? Were you put
                        upon, tried to be recruited, harassed or anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: You are always aware of that, and there was certainly a conscious
                    effort to intimidate and it started at the very beginning. For me, it didn't
                    involve anything physical, but let me give you an example. We had arrived in
                    Moscow. We were living in an apartment away from the embassy; the foreigners
                    tended to be clustered in apartment complexes with militiamen stationed in
                    little booths outside. We were in a great, old merchant area of Moscow
                    (Zamoskvarechiye”) where you could walk out and be right in the heart of real
                    Moscow. Something happened with the television set in the apartment. I turned
                    the back of the television around and was fooling with it, figuring maybe just
                    by luck I would hit upon something that would make the television work. And the
                    phone rang. I pick up the phone and there's nobody on the phone. I go back and
                    start tinkering with the television. The phone rings. Nobody on the phone. As
                    soon as I touched the television again, the phone would ring. So I guess the
                    people on the phone thought I was a little slow on the uptake, was not getting
                    the message.</p>
                <p>So the next time when the phone rang, I picked it up, and nobody was there, and I
                    hung up again. But the phone continued to ring. The phone is hung up now, right?
                    In its cradle, and just going, ring, ring. So they're telling me - this is the
                    message for the less astute among us - that we know what you are doing, we are
                    here. So I buried the phone under pillows and everything and it just kept
                    ringing all night. Or, you'd be out someplace and the moment you came into the
                    house, the phone would ring and there would be nobody on it. My assumption was
                    that it was to sort of let you know that they're there. That type of thing. And
                    you're always aware of possibly being approached. I never had anything that was
                    definitely black and white. It's more you're always wondering why this person is
                    telling you this particular information, why is he taking you to this theater
                    production when he really doesn't know about the theater. So you are wondering,
                    “Well, why, I wonder why” and you just sort of tuck that away in the back of
                    your mind. And this is going on constantly, part of your internal processing. It
                    gets into your veins so deeply that I recall being back I the U.S. and riding
                    with friends in New Jersey, on a highway in New Jersey, and somebody asked me a
                    question about my personal life. Something normal that friends would ask about.

                <p>McCARTHY: And I remember my stomach tightening up and thinking, “What an
                    indiscrete question to be asking in a car (which could easily be bugged)!”
                    [laughter] Now that's crazy, and I'd only been there two years, so you can
                    imagine the self-censorship mechanisms that people develop who grow up in that

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you traveled, did you always travel in pairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, you always traveled in pairs. During that time there was even a
                    rash of food poisonings of the defense attach�s, so they had to take samples of
                    food back, just to make sure. So, yes, that was a problem. You couldn't travel
                    alone.Q: I take it that Soviets would not talk about, you know, after
                    Brezhnev... Obviously that whole regime was straffish, as you would say. They
                    were all aging and you had the feeling that their minds weren't working too
                    well. In fact, one wonders all about the Afghanistan invasion - it didn't make
                    an awful lot of sense. But, did you get into any political discussions with
                    anyone?</p>
                <p>McCARTHY: With a few people, but generally people didn't bring that up. That was
                    something they didn't get into. It wasn't as though they thought they were going
                    to have a role in deciding whom it was, or determining anything, it would pretty
                    much be somebody who was on the politburo and they wouldn't decide it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in a way you were spared. Being in the cultural
                        field, you didn't have to read Borba or Pravda on a daily basis.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: No, I didn't. Some of my colleagues did. And there was also a dissident
                    account in the embassy. Officers had that responsibility - just what you asked
                    about. You know, going out and talking to dissidents to find out their views and
                    why they thought what they did. That was their political beat. The average
                    person would not talk to you about that, thought some friends would.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering, we put an awful lot of focus on
                        dissidents, and I guess it sort of came with the territory, but how did you
                        feel about this? Was this just sort of keeping the flame alive or it was the
                        only game in town? Was this of any real importance?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: Dissidents is a big word. We are talking about major figures like
                    Sakharov all the way down to somebody who is more junior. But a lot of people
                    who were already in that category had made their decision on what was important
                    to them in life and what risks they were going to run, and what consequences
                    they were going to live with and they wanted to get information out. They wanted
                    people on the outside to understand what was going on. Information would get
                    into the external press, be reported on the radios, inform opinion. That was in
                    their interest, too, so there was a mutuality there, I think, in a lot of those
                    instances.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about newspapers, what reviews of plays in all this?
                        Was this a political area at all, I mean reviews?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, well the reviews don't come out right away. It's not like the play
                    opens and then the next day you go and see what the review is. There would be a
                    delay and then something might be written up in “Literaturnaya Gazeta,” the
                    Literary Gazette. And depending who wrote it, it could be rather informative,
                    but the real information on a lot of things, so many things, was word of mouth.
                    You'd hear that there was a theater being closed down by the police. So you'd go
                    over to the theater, and they'd invite you in, and you'd talk to them about it.
                    You wouldn't read about it in the paper. Or you'd hear about a politically
                    sensitive play and go to the dress rehearsal.</p>
                <p>Let me give you an example of how information traveled unofficially. Gary Burton
                    on vibraphone and Chick Corea on piano were to give a concert in the Composer's
                    Union Hall in Moscow. This was a big deal already but they were letting us do
                    this. It was a modest hall, there were no announcements in the papers, or
                    anything, nothing public. But people from as far away as Vladivostok, on the
                    Pacific, seven time zones away, heard about this and came. Jazz buffs,
                    aficionados... because there is a network of information in any particular group
                    you want to name that gets that information around. So at an unadvertised
                    concert, there was a square full of people outside the hall, wanting to get in.
                    The seats inside were already full up.</p>
                <p>That same concert illustrates another point about how information gets around.
                    Willis Conover had hosted a jazz program on VOA Radio for 30 years or so, a
                    forbidden radio. He was in town at the same time as Gary Burton and Chick Corea,
                    but nobody really knew about that. They knew about Corea and Burton through word
                    of mouth. Imagine the scene. The hall is packed, they're expecting this
                    performance by Gary Burton and Chick Corea. The lights go down, it's very dim.
                    You see a standup microphone on the small state. Now a figure walks out and
                    stands by the microphone, and he says, “Good evening, ladies...” and that's as
                    far as he got...the place went crazy! People standing on chairs, cheering,
                    clapping. It was Willis Conover ...his voice so familiar for so many years,
                    right there in Moscow. All the audience needed was a couple of words. And they
                    were so familiar with the voice and loved it so much because of a radio (VOA)
                    that had no official standing at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in observing these, I guess they're
                        called educational lectures or something...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Oh, God. [laughter] Yes. Particularly in St. Petersburg, the year after
                    Moscow. They were called the Znanie Society lectures, the Knowledge Society
                    lectures. And you would attend and it was so painful. You spent three hours and
                    took notes on what the individual said and what the questions were and the
                    general tenor of the discussion. And you'd do a cable on it. This was one way of
                    reporting back what the Communist Party's popular outreach was on different
                    issues. And you'd be in there on a Sunday afternoon and you could count on
                    probably five or six hours of daylight that day, and you're spending three of
                    them sitting there in the Znanie Society Lecture. That came up every five weeks
                    or so in St. Petersburg on a rotational basis among Russian speakers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left Moscow, you went to, well we're talking
                        about Leningrad in those days...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the difference from your feeling between the two
                        cities?McCARTHY: On the one hand, St. Petersburg, Leningrad was more open,
                        slightly more cosmopolitan... not more cosmopolitan, I'll take that back...
                        more open to the West in a sense. But the authorities there wanted to show
                        that they were more Catholic than the Pope. So they would harass the
                        scholars and exchangees, and one of your responsibilities was counseling
                        them, having them over, intervening on their behalf. I remember a consular
                        officer meeting with a dissident lawyer, and when he came out of the
                        meeting, the consular officer was assaulted, I mean physically assaulted.
                        Again the administration was making a point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>It was a smaller operation as well. The real creative juices were flowing in
                    Moscow in terms of theater productions and things like that. But you could do
                    things. Our approach in St. Petersburg was similar to what we did in Moscow. We
                    had the consul general's residence as a culture center of sorts. So, for
                    example, we had a graphics art exhibit, curated by the State University of New
                    York, in Albany. We brought it into Leningrad, professionally curated, labeled
                    the works and hung them in the residence. This was Ray Benson's brainchild, by
                    the way. We had special showings, and at any event in the residence - say Pearl
                    Bailey - guests could also see the art. We had access to institutions there.
                    Dick Callner, the curator of the SUNY exhibit, came and had a discussion/slide
                    show for professional staff at the Hermitage on current trends in American art.
                    As long as it didn't attract a whole lot of attention, you could do things. We
                    had programs at the conservatory. We had what we used to call Cultural
                    Ambassadors, Nancy Weems, for example, was resident there for some weeks and
                    gave master classes. We brought in a judge to talk to law students. We could
                    arrange all those things through the right contacts.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>I would say it might be a little harder there than Moscow, and you didn't have
                    quite the same support. It was a smaller staff, you know, one American officer,
                    an American secretary, and several local employees to do the public diplomacy
                    work, whereas in Moscow you would had a public affairs officer, a cultural
                    affairs officer, an executive officer, assistant information officers, and
                    assistant cultural affairs officers. A big operation. And the Leningrad consular
                    district was responsible for the Baltic states, of course. And there the
                    difference was profound. When I traveled out to Lithuania, I visited a
                    teacher-training institute and they with me normally, served coffee, and just
                    chatted. By contrast, when I went to a similar institute in Leningrad, they were
                    deathly afraid, as though I was going to reach across the table and steal their
                    souls somehow. By this time, when I was in Leningrad, this whole intermediate
                    nuclear range issue in Europe...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The SS-20...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Exactly. The SS-20 and the Pershing/cruise missile response. Absent an
                    agreement, NATO was going to install those missiles. So the Soviets were
                    intentionally feeding the rumor mill that this was putting us on the brink of
                    war, this was exceptionally dangerous, the Americans were crazy, Reagan was a
                    war monger, etc., etc. So this complicated things.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was your consul general in Leningrad?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: First of all, it was Bill Shin. And then Charlie McGee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have much contact with students and faculties in
                        either place?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, we had. And there was a tradition of that. Let me just back up a
                    second. The exchange of students and young faculty members, Ph.D. students,
                    began around 1959 or so with the er-university Committee on Travel Grants based
                    at Indiana University. Soon the responsibility passed to another organization,
                    the International Research and Exchanges Board, IREX, a non-profit organization.
                    They administered this program that was funded through the Bureau of Education
                    and Cultural Affairs. There was an overarching U.S.-U.S.S.R. bilateral agreement
                    that covered these exchanges, and every two years you'd sit down and negotiate a
                    more specific two-year protocol. I participated in several of these, and it's
                    very detailed and a bit tedious - how many visitors will we have, and how many
                    performing arts groups, and what art the provisions for having somebody
                    lecture?, etc., etc. All during that time we had contact with students and
                    faculty, partly by virtue of the exchange program. When the bilateral exchanges
                    agreement lapsed after Afghanistan, you would think, “Well, probably these
                    educational/cultural exchanges will end, too.” But they didn't. Everybody just
                    looked the other way, and IREX continued to manage these exchanges of scholars
                    and students, and in the Soviet Union we continued to be involved. Those
                    scholars and students were in St. Petersburg/Leningrad, and they were in Moscow.
                    Particularly in Leningrad, we had quite a bit of contact with them. We were
                    trying to help them with their access to archives. We tried to cheer them up,
                    invite them over, and give them advice. One of them may still be wearing my old
                    U.S. army overcoat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the time... this was a time of sort of almost the last
                        gasp of the Soviet Union. Correct me if I'm wrong, but as I see it, the last
                        gasp of the Soviet Union trying to make a major push toward the West with
                        these intermediate-range rockets and all, trying to split essentially Europe
                        off from the United States. In the Soviet Union, was there concern that this
                        thing might get out of hand, or was this just another part of the old game
                        that had been played for years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: You mean concern on the part of the...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yourselves, and also was this affecting, were you reading
                        this into the Soviet populace?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: They certainly were more worried. The people who you associated with
                    before were worried about conflict. Yes. So it did have an impact. And then
                    every American visitor got a dose of this to bring back... People were genuinely
                    nervous. This was a time of last gasps. You know, Brezhnev died, and the city
                    closed down. There were lines of people going through the street. An army
                    division was mobilized. And then you had Andropov for a while, and he died, and
                    then you had Chernenko. I left before he died, but he was already, as you said
                    in the “last gasp” phase. Last gasp is an appropriate term, since he had
                    emphysema and he could hardly breathe when he speaking in public.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it was Ronald Reagan who made the remark saying,
                        “Why don't you have better contact with the Soviets?” “Well, they keep dying
                        on us.” [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: [laughter] The time of funerals.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When Brezhnev went, was there concern? He'd been around a

                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: It wasn't like the accounts you read of Stalin's death - despair,
                    panic. When Brezhnev died, there were long lines of people to go into that trade
                    union hall and observe the body lying in state. It was a major production. I was
                    there for quite some time, since there was press coverage and we were working
                    with the American press. There was also extensive television
                    coverage...speeches....the actual burial.. But I don't recall any real
                    concern.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you spent, what, three years in the Soviet
                        Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Right.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And so, '84, whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: In '84 I came back to the States. I went into the Office of European
                    Programs as Deputy Policy Officer. That' was in USIA. That only lasted about
                    five months and I then I became executive assistant to the Counselor of USIA.
                    The Counselor was the senior foreign service officer position within the agency.
                    He was a counselor to the director and dealt with problems that had not been
                    resolved elsewhere, were inchoate, or had an interagency focus. At an early
                    stage of development ideas often came to the Counselor for resolution,
                    structuring, shaping, etc. It was a very interesting two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you did that essentially from '84 to '86?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, I did. From '84 to '86.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the counselor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: The counselor was a great officer. Stan Burnett was his name. He was
                    just terrific. He could conceptualize, he could communicate with people, he
                    could delegate, he had trust and vision. He was a real boon to USIA and did a
                    lot of things to forestall missteps farther down the road.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this is during the Charlie Wick period, which from
                        what I gather was both positive and negative. I think he was erratic, but
                        what was your impression?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Exactly. Yes, that was exactly it. When I was in the Office of European
                    Programs, we were building up the European component of WordNet. Now this was a
                    visionary thing. Charlie Wick put in a global television network based in
                    American embassies. Way ahead of his time. Against much resistance, and there
                    was a lot of broken china. It was forced through. You know, 'You have to take
                    these two hours' you had to come up with something to use this time. But,
                    ultimately, it was beneficial. For example, as you recall, after we linked the
                    nightclub bombing in Berlin to Libya, we had an air strike on Libya. We decided
                    we needed immediate access to Western European media to inform publics and help
                    shape public opinion right away. We lined up WordNet and Secretary Schultz was
                    on WordNet the next morning, early, with all the major media outlets in Europe,
                    setting the tone. So, even though it was tough getting WordNet going, and a lot
                    of people's noses were out of joint, it worked.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, Mr. Wick had an insatiable desire for information, which
                    ultimately could not really be satisfied. There was a system of missives that
                    went out all through the agency with deadlines, and you had to respond to these
                    little missives. They were known as Z-grams (from Mr. Wick's middle initial I
                    believe), and they were on green sheets of paper. It was an art form to be able
                    to conclude a Z-gram. You could never end it saying something like, “We'll keep
                    you posted if there are further developments” or, “We will be watching this
                    carefully.” Phrases like that prompted follow-ups. A month later, you'd get,
                    “What's the status now?” So, you'd have to say, “This concludes all action on
                    this matter.” He had a legitimate question: How do I figure out what is going on
                    here I'm talking to people, and something stimulates me, and I have an idea and
                    I want to get it out to the bureaucracy, and how do I do it? How do I really
                    keep informed about what's going on? In the era of email, he probably would have
                    been satisfied. I hadn't thought about this before, but perhaps he was a bit
                    ahead of his time in that respect too.</p>
                <p>And budgets, did I mention budgets? I mean, that was a big deal under Wick. We
                    got a lot of money.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's interesting how Wick... I give him great credit for
                        getting money.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Apparently difficult to work for.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes.Q: How did Burnett deal with him?</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: One of Stan's great virtues is he didn't gossip about things like that.
                    So, Wick could trust him. He could be a trusted interlocutor. Stan was not going
                    to then run back to his office and delight everybody with the tales. He just
                    handled it, whatever “it” was. He got along well with Wick. He was really a heat
                    shield, or lightning rod. Choose your metaphor. He understood Wick well and set
                    out to accommodate the director's wishes while absorbing the heat that often
                    went with some of the Director's requests. Unlike some people, Stan did not
                    radiate the heat on to those below him in the hierarchy. He isolated heat and
                    content, and we dealt with the content. Stan dealt with the senior leadership of
                    the agency, getting what Wick wanted in a way that was reasonable and had
                    minimal ancillary damage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things I found, speaking as a non-USIA officer,
                        was that except for methods such as WordNet and all that, USIA in the
                        Washington assignments would seems to be often quite unsatisfying because
                        there isn't much to do with policy, with Yugoslavia or something like that.
                        Did you find that? I think USIA has tremendous responsibilities once they
                        get overseas. But in Washington, public diplomacy, as it's now called,
                        doesn't play much role.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have that feeling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: I think public diplomacy is more recognized now perhaps than in recent
                    time. You can frame the issue the way you did, i.e. you could say that USIA did
                    not have much to do with policy and therefore the work in Washington was not as
                    satisfying. But you can frame it another way. You could say that the corporate
                    culture of USIA is different from State's. It is not a spider web radiating out
                    from Washington, where demarches are directed, items on which to report are
                    directed. USIA had a more decentralized way of doing things. Washington knew
                    what the objectives are in each country (we always had a yearly County Plan).
                    However, Washington relied on its public diplomacy teams at post to analyze the
                    institutions involved, to see where the points of influence and possible dialog
                    are, to shape resources to get what's needed, and then to request specific forms
                    of support from Washington. Washington can disagree, of course, but there was a
                    presumption in favor of the people on the ground.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>Conditions varied greatly form country to country, and the best track to success
                    was drawing on the expertise and knowledge of staff closest to the situation
                    overseas. USIA had a flatter organizational structure, and there was more a give
                    and take with Washington. In other words, the lack of control from Washington
                    was a virtue rather than a handicap, precisely because it resulted in the best
                    understanding, dialog, and advocacy where it counted - abroad. At the same time,
                    I think some people who had political ambitions might have been be frustrated in
                    USIA. I found the management challenge in Washington - I was an area director
                    later - amply rewarding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in many ways, USIA officers, both in the field and
                        back in Washington, being a small organization, have far more management
                        opportunities than, say, a desk officer who might share with three other
                        officers- (end of tape)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>When you concluded this time, whither in '86?</p>
                <p>McCARTHY: This was a great, great year. I got what we call an academic year. I
                    spent it in Washington, and I took courses in a variety of institutions -
                    Georgetown in Russian history with Professor Stites, a course with Dimity Simes
                    at SAIS on current Soviet policy, a course in Communist political philosophy
                    with Professor Linden at George Washington University, events at the Kenyan
                    Institute.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wilson Center...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Wilson Center. It was wonderful. The next semester I spent mostly at
                    George Washington University doing East European study, where Professor Sharon
                    Wolchek was a great help. By then I knew I was going to Hungary, so it was one
                    of those perfect situations where everything made sense. The academic material
                    relates to your ongoing assignment so you're motivated and you're thinking about
                    practicalities as you go through it. The year after that I had Hungarian
                    language training for 44 weeks and then went out to Budapest as Public Affairs
                    Officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were taking your academic year and you had these
                        real experts on the Soviet Union, were you getting any inkling, or more than
                        an inkling, of the fact that the bloody place was falling apart?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Well, at the beginning of that time, it's hard to remember now, but one
                    of the big questions was, “Is Gorbachev for real? Is he really a reformer?”
                    People were split on that and then of course as time went on it became clear
                    that these were dramatic, epochal changes taking place. So, yes, not so much
                    falling apart, but that big changes were afoot. For sure.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were in the Soviet Union before, were you
                        picking up anything about the ethnic minority, not ethnic but the
                        nationality, the nationalities were major divisions within the Soviet Union
                        and keeping them in place might be more than the Soviets could do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes. On occasion you would. It was particularly clear in places like
                    Latvia and Lithuania, Estonia (though technically not Soviet) And you could hear
                    it between the lines as people talked to you. Very, very clear.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things that is interesting... this wouldn't
                        have been your field... but how were political, in particular economic
                        people, looking at the Soviet Union in such great detail, and yet as I come
                        back to my phrase, the place was falling apart. And people would come back,
                        just visitors coming back from Des Moines, or something, would come back and
                        say, the place just doesn't work. Were we seeing this, did one get to accept
                        this as being just kind of the way it is, but this is all it's going to be
                        together and it's really just a powerful place, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: I think part of it was that you could not draw a direct line from the
                    state of bathrooms in a hotel or the food service in a restaurant, or the
                    availability of consumer goods to the status of the highest priority investments
                    of the Soviet Union. Take, for example, anti-ballistic missiles, conventional
                    arms, external intelligence, domestic intelligence. They were at a high level.
                    Although one noticed shortcomings everywhere, there didn't seem to be strategic
                    shortcomings. The control that existed and the fear that control could inspire
                    made it seem unlikely the Soviet structure would collapse any time soon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you end up in the Hungarian program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: I wanted to go to that part of the world again, and Hungary seemed like
                    an interesting place. I didn't realize how interesting it would be. This was the
                    opportunity of a lifetime, and I will never experience anything like that again.
                    The people who were there at that critical time still remark upon it as being an
                    incredible experience. In spring 1988 Janos Kadar has just been replaced as
                    Party General Secretary. In the space of my four years in Hungary we went from a
                    reformist communist government to the collapse of Communism, peaceful elections,
                    a democratic government, and grappling with all those basic issues that affect a
                    country making a transition from authoritarianism to democracy and full market
                    economics. It was immensely satisfying to be there during that time and to have
                    the resources to help the process along. It was like time-lapse photography. You
                    know, usually you plan something, a long time goes by, you see a little bit come
                    up here, a little bit there. In Hungary it was as though it was all telescoped,
                    like those Disney films where they speed it all up and you see the flower come
                    out and bloom and blossoms and the bumblebees come... It was like that.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Hungarian as a language?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: A very complex language. A very fascinating language. If you like the
                    New York Times crossword, for example, it would appeal to you. It's
                    agglutinative, and when you glom on something, then other changes take place.
                    It's like a little domino theory within a word. The language is similar to the
                    Rubik's Cube, which was developed by a Hungarian, the same thing. I liked it. I
                    liked it a lot. Still, it's on an intellectual level with me, unlike Serbian and
                    Russian, which are more emotional for me. But it's a great language.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job when you went out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Public Affairs Officer (PAO).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you sort of describe the structure of the embassy
                        when you went out, and who was doing what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Right. When I went out there in 1988, there was an ambassador,
                    Ambassador Mark Palmer; a Deputy Chief of Mission, Don Kirsch; then you had a
                    political section that had two people; an economics section that had two people;
                    science attach�; a defense attach� with maybe three or four slots; a modest
                    admin section. Our USIA public diplomacy section was a PAO, a deputy and maybe
                    six or seven Foreign Service National employees. And we were only in Budapest.
                    We weren't anywhere else. We were all inside the embassy building on Szabadsag
                    ter, a nice mansion of a building. In other words, not ready for what was going
                    to happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived, what was the Hungarian government like,
                        and what was the status of our relations with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Our relations were good. There were no major irritants. The USG had
                    returned the crown of St. Stephen some years earlier. Again, this was the
                    Gorbachev era. We didn't know how far reform was going to go, but Janos Kadar
                    had just been replaced, and he was associated with inviting the Soviet troops to
                    crush the 1956 uprising. There was a Communist reformer within the government,
                    Imre Pozsgoy, who was considered sort of the great hope. The ambassador had a
                    lot of contact with him, as well as with other elements of the government. It
                    was a good relationship.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Having gone through the Prague spring and even before that
                        the putting down in Budapest of the Hungarian revolution, there had been
                        these springing up things. A hundred flowers bloom and they get their heads
                        chopped off.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there concern on our side that this might be in the
                        offing, and by Hungarian contacts, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, that's an important question. After the 1956 uprising and
                    suppression, there was a period where not much happened. But then around the
                    late 1960s, 1968 or so, the New Economic Mechanism was launched. Economic reform
                    was permitted in Hungary, permitted by the Soviets, I mean, as long as none of
                    the holy of holies was challenged - the role of the Party, Warsaw Pact. People
                    who had been involve in '56 below the leadership level were able to conduct
                    research. They were in institutes. They weren't stoking furnaces someplace, as
                    they did in Czechoslovakia. I don't mean to minimize retribution after '56.
                    People were imprisoned, Imre Nagy was executed, etc. But still many Hungarians
                    could continue with their research, as long as they didn't teach, and that was a
                    difference with Czechoslovakia, I thinAnd there was this, I believe,
                    self-restraint, this recognition that you can do things as long as you don't
                    cause a lot of publicity. Hungary is not really on anybody's front page. We will
                    just go along, making our economic system a little more like a functioning
                    commercial system. And, very important for your question, Ambassador Palmer took
                    it upon himself to be in touch constantly with the opposition. So you had young,
                    highly educated Hungarians who wanted a new way of doing things, and he would
                    have them over to the residence, he would even be out in the streets sometimes
                    when they were marching. Partly that was, it seems to me, to show support for
                    what we believed in and partly so that you wouldn't have these flowers, as you
                    put it, chopped off when they're just starting to put their heads up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the role of the public affairs officer, and what
                        sort of things would you do, when you arrive, because obviously we're going
                        to talk about the changing environment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: When I arrived, the first thing I tried to do was figure out what was
                    happening. .What are the resources we have? What can the staff do? And what are
                    the points that we can concentrate on? There's going to be reform, I can see
                    that already. I wanted to avoid a scattershot approach and really make it count.
                    What is the likely calendar of events so that our resources can come online when
                    they really make sense in the Hungarian context and be welcomed and used. Where
                    is the intersection of American and Hungarian interests where we can get the
                    most bang for the buck? I would say that my predecessor had done a wonderful job
                    putting USIS in position to play an important role.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Csaba Chikes was his name. Establishing great contacts with the media.
                    The main television was across the street. Csaba knew everybody in the weekly
                    news program, the daily news program. He took me around. Same thing with
                    Hungarian radio. We spent time together before he left. That was terrific. I
                    could lunch off that for a long period of time. So, initially, getting people,
                    American visitors, on Hungarian television and on Hungarian radio and with
                    interviews in the press to express support for reform was important. You know,
                    opportunities for the Ambassador to do that were very important. Running the
                    exchange programs was important. Bringing people in to talk to Hungarians. But
                    those first few months were a feeling-out period.</p>
                <p>And then I think the first thing we took on was in the legal area. There was a
                    new Justice Minister, Minister of Justice, who was very reform-oriented. And he
                    wanted to make changes. Among the changes he wanted to make was having a new
                    constitution, and this was before the real changes occurred later. The contest
                    was changes within a communist state. So, the Ambassador had him over and we
                    worked with him and suggested a program of activities. We would take his
                    drafting team, drafting the constitution, and send them to the United States.
                    They would consult with experts, take a look at how a state's constitution
                    functioned, look at the division of powers, look at what the courts did on
                    constitutional challenges.</p>
                <p>Through all this, it was very delicate because the Hungarians are highly educated
                    people and you had to avoid seeming to patronize. You had to avoid seeming to
                    saying, “We will teach you how to do it,” because they weren't going to stand
                    for that. So you would legitimately frame it as a chance to take a look at the
                    American experience as you look at the other experiences because you are going
                    to draw on and reject parts of what other people do. This was a chance to take a
                    look at what we do in the U.S. We then proposed, or we talked about, a
                    constitutional conference, sort of stimulated that idea. They did have the
                    conference. We brought in an appellate judge and constitutional scholars to
                    participate in that conference. At the same time, we worked with Hungarian book
                    publishers to publish the Federalist Papers in Hungarian, to publish the
                    American Constitution in Hungarian, works of political philosophy. These were
                    then sold in bookstores and we also distributed them.</p>
                <p>Looking down the road a little bit, we put in place internships and fellowships
                    for young, promising Hungarian legal scholars and practitioners who would go to
                    the States and study, get a master's degree, Master of Laws, and come back. So
                    we were working with Justice Ministry on what they were doing, working to
                    prepare the next generation, providing the American experience to them,
                    publishing materials that would be of use to all these folks and help shape the
                    political culture, and supporting this constitutional conference.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>Later on, we followed up on some specific things. There was a professor of law
                    there who was not in our program, Professor Fletcher from Columbia University,
                    who spoke Hungarian, and he was doing judicial training for people. So, we went
                    down and attended some of those sessions and added on International Visitor
                    programs for some of the best participants in those programs. We did moot courts
                    where people would come in and do mock trials, and with USIA support, we had
                    American experts participate in that.</p>
                <p>And then way down, this would be a couple of years later, we had a person in the
                    Ministry with a phone and fax and all that, and that person would field queries.
                    If the Ministry of Justice wanted to take a look at some aspect of American
                    legal processes, judicial processes, that person would field the inquiry and
                    then send it to Columbia University where there were law students and professors
                    engaged to help with answering that queries.</p>
                <p>So that was one of the first things we did- law. We picked three or four
                    different areas where we thought we could make a difference, which were in line
                    with what we're supposed to be doing anyway. We're supposed to be telling
                    America's story to the world. So here you had the most interested constituency
                    you could imagine on this particular aspect of what the United States is all
                    about. Very attentive, and with great influence in their country. In additional
                    to helping them solve astonishing complex problems, we also had a wonderful
                    audience for talking about the United States; and, by the way, people in the
                    United States were afforded the opportunity to hear about what was going on in
                    Hungary from the people who were shaping the legal system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me about the legal system. You know, you have the
                        common law, and you have the Code Napoleon. And, they are not terribly
                        compatible.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think Hungary would fall under the code, rather
                        than the...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: And this is one of the things that we were constantly talking to the
                    Hungarians about: you might want to take some of the things that we offer and
                    not other things. But when you are talking about a judge functioning in
                    chambers, how the judge organizes the judicial calendar, how the judge disposes
                    of cases, and what the jury system, jury trials are all about... all that is
                    compatible. So, you're right. Not everything is applicable. And there are other
                    areas like that, too, where... and the Hungarians constantly made that point to
                    us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think the overall point is that we were, you might say,
                        proactive. We jumped into this thing right away, rather than doing the
                        traditional diplomatic thing and sitting back and saying, “We note that
                        they're making changes...”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In other words, there's a reporting function, and the
                        other one is to roll up your sleeves and get in there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Right. And I have to say that Ambassador Palmer sort of set the tone
                    for that embassy as proactive. Very much so. And Charlie Thomas, when he came in
                    later, continued that. They were both very supportive of the public diplomacy
                    activities, as was the DCM/Charge Don Kirsh.</p>
                <p>Another example. We knew that with changing regulations, there would be more
                    small business development, that is, as these large, state-supported enterprises
                    change, people would be starting their own firms, people would be looking for
                    ways to make money when they couldn't make money the normal ways. So, working
                    with the economic section, we focused on a small Hungarian outfit established to
                    support small business. We helped them, sent the director to the States on the
                    International Visitors Program. Then we heard about this wonderful woman,
                    Katherine Marshall, who had left, speaks Hungarian, and was high up in the Small
                    Business Administration of the United States. So we worked for about three
                    months or so to try to get her to Hungary. We succeeded and USIA, bless its
                    soul, bent a lot of their procedures so that she could come for a long stay, and
                    that was extended for months. She worked with Agnes Tibor in this small business
                    development organization to develop materials in Hungarian, run seminars,
                    identify key people to go to the United States on programs, so that by the time
                    this subject got up high on the Hungarian government agenda, we really had a lot
                    in place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about other countries? Were they involved in this?
                        Germans, French?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes. There was the British Know-How Fund. In fact, Katherine Marshall
                    went around with the Prince of Wales for two days, advising him on small
                    business development, which elevated her prestige and the prestige of our
                    small-business operation immeasurably, and also provided good advice to the
                    British. They were there. The European Union had the PHARE Project (Poland,
                    Hungary Assistance and Reconstruction of the Economy, I think) to provide
                    technical assistance. If you are looking at this in the abstract, you'd say,
                    “The way to approach this is let's all sit around a table, all the donors, we'll
                    decide what we want to do; we'll make what we want to do complementary; we'll
                    achieve critical mass by combining resources; and we'll go forward with a plan.”
                    But in fact, the funding cycles are so different, and the EU has so many
                    constituencies to satisfy... It has its own procedures and timetables. So,
                    actually it's better to proceed and then make things make sense on the ground by
                    meeting with people and trying to make things mesh... But yes, there were other
                    countries involved. I don't think anyone was off the mark as quickly as we were.
                    Now, I have to say, we weren't there with immense resources either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the non-governmental organizations? You know,
                        the legal ones, there are all sorts of...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that work out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: We tried to identify good, non-governmental organizations that we could
                    work with in Hungary. And we did. There was one called, DAC, Democracy after
                    Communism, for example, that we worked with on legal matters, just sort of
                    coordinated on issues. The SEED organization (Support for East European
                    Democracy) was a non-governmental organization. And there were the
                    non-governmental organizations that were involved from the United States. For
                    example, the National Democratic Institute, the International Republican
                    Institute. Once we got into having elections, they were extremely good, coming
                    in, working with the opposition parties. There were hotels, resorts, that were
                    not used, they were off-season, on Lake Balaton. They'd bring everybody down -
                    politicians, campaign managers - and they'd have a seminar for a week or two
                    weeks. They did great, great things. They'd have the same expert coming back in
                    who was very knowledgeable. And we would not try to compete with that. We would
                    see that was happening and we would think that was great, and we would look
                    ahead to where we could make a difference - After Parliament is elected, then
                    what?</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>And so, in advance of the elections, we worked with Parliament on a parliamentary
                    reference service, like a congressional research service, something of that
                    nature. We got a good program going, partly because a flight was missed, a
                    flight was diverted. The chancellor of the State University of New York and a
                    small delegation were flying to Poland and their flight got diverted. So we met
                    for dinner since they were in town anyway. They were talking about this
                    legislative support program they had in Chile, run out of SUNY Albany. And it
                    sounded great. So we explained what was going on in Hungary and that there were
                    going to be these parliamentary elections and we'd need something like that.</p>
                <p>And the long and the short of it is that USIA funded that individual - who'd done
                    that Chile project - to come to Hungary and work with the parties, and work with
                    the library that was attached to the parliament and get ready for this
                    congressional research service. This, then, was followed up by an AID grant to
                    SUNY. AID sent an American expert in to be resident for a year, and when our
                    Congress, with Congressman Frost at the head, decided to have a big project to
                    help east central European parliaments with information systems, we had
                    something to build on and excellent contacts. So non-governmental bodies were
                    important. There were other NGOs from outside, like the German Marshall Fund
                    that were very active and very good. There must be others; none strike me right
                    now. Our desire was always to include them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can see where you would have a major problem in whatever
                        kind of help we gave of our not appearing condescending or something like
                        that...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Right.Q: So much of what we've done has been in places where you really
                    didn't have the intellectual reservoir that you could draw on in a place like
                    Hungary.</p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, it permeated everything. And it's all in your attitude. In the
                    Justice Ministry, there was a period there, where, a deputy justice minister
                    initially was very cold to the idea of working with us because of that. But I
                    think when they see your good will and you recognize their attainments, and they
                    see that what you really are doing is compensating for the types of contacts
                    that would have happened except for Communism, which limited these types of

                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, some of them would come back. I mentioned Katherine Marshall, and
                    of course there was George Soros. Some of the political scientists would come
                    back. And they had their own contacts, generally. So, it was more they would do
                    their thing and we would talk to them about what was going on.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the exchange program, which I guess we had for
                        some years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that the Hungarians who had gone to the
                        United States, been in the exchange program and come back, were they a group
                        you could get together with. Did they prove to be a good source or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes. You have excellent people in every field, pretty much, in Hungary.
                    So you could choose very good people to go on the International Visitor program,
                    academic exchanges, etc. The people who went on the Fulbright program were often
                    heading up departments or in senior positions in the universities. And then we
                    had Americans coming this way, of course. About this time, we had the Support
                    for East European Democracy Act, the SEED Act, special legislation to support
                    economic and political reform. So we were able to increase the number of
                    Fulbrighters dramatically. Hungary had, at one point, and I still remember this
                    number, 57 Fulbrighters, which was second in Europe only to Germany. We were
                    lucky because Hungary was out in front. In '89 there was general revolution and
                    a lot of these issues that Hungary was then facing became more common. But we
                    had a head start in terms of calling on resources and having the leisure, in a
                    sense, to think about what we wanted to do, map it out, explain our plan to
                    Washington, and get those resources.</p>
                <p>But the Fulbright program was very important. We dealt with the Fulbrighters all
                    the time. We had brown bag lunches. USIS had moved, by the way. From this
                    embassy we moved into a self-standing operation with the Foreign Commercial
                    Service and into one wonderful building. We had a multi-purpose room there where
                    we had a standing invitation, I think it was once a month, to a brown bag lunch
                    for Fulbrighters, 12 to 2 on Wednesday, whatever it was. And we'd try to go, and
                    if there was something we wanted to convey, we'd convey it, and if there was
                    something they wanted to talk about, they'd talk about. What we tried to do was
                    get Fulbrighters involved beyond teaching in the classroom. If someone was
                    teaching in Budapest, we'd try to get them out to do a one-week seminar in a
                    provincial university. If somebody was an expert in public administration, we
                    wanted to get them down to a city that was talking about improving the way they
                    administered the city. If somebody came on a short grant and looked good, we
                    tried to convince them to apply for a full-year Fulbright, so they'd come back
                    and be resident over the long term. So that was an extremely important element.
                    The first Minister of Foreign Affairs was a Fulbrighter, for example. We were
                    always trying to work with other institutions, so they could be partners with
                    our exchange scholars. So that gets to your NGO question, but it also gets to
                    the Fulbright program, because we wanted to have a bilateral Fulbright
                    Commission. Ultimately, by the my fourth year, we had a binational Fulbright
                    Commission to run the Fulbright Program, which meant that it didn't have to be
                    run out of the U.S. Information Service.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, as we watched this... This is prior to the events of
                        November-December of '89 but earlier than that... Hungary was way out ahead,
                        wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Way out ahead. They had this reform government that went through that
                    first year. Then they decided on parliamentary elections. Now, Poland was ahead
                    of Hungary in the sense that they'd had their election, but... I shouldn't say
                    but. The Poles were out ahead so far in so many ways for this postwar period,
                    but their election guaranteed a certain number of seats to the Communists in
                    some formula. I forget the exact details, but it was a necessary accommodation
                    to reality at the time. But the Hungarian election was completely free, that is
                    you had a slate of candidates and you voted. I remember going out to the polling
                    places, which was another memorable, memorable day... (oh to say nothing of
                    the... let me just come back to the Germans living in Hungary. That was a big
                    deal.) But you went around to these election sites, these little villages. I
                    drove to six or seven little villages. The poll-watchers were there, the
                    electoral committee was there, the urn was there, and the enclosed cabins. The
                    people were as pleased as punch, just to be able to do this. And you'd talk to
                    people after they had voted and they'd say how wonderful it was. And some old
                    people would say they were voting for FIDESZ, which was the youth party,
                    “because after all, we haven't been able to do too much, maybe the young people
                    will be able to do something.”</p>
                <p>But in addition to, talking about being way out ahead in those ways, Hungary
                    offered chances for East-West communication too. Lake Balaton was traditionally
                    a place where families could reunite from two sides of the Iron Curtain. West
                    Germans could drive into Hungary very easily with their campers and go to a
                    campsite in Lake Balaton. East Germans could drive down to a campsite, and lo
                    and behold they happened to be parked in the same campsite, and they would talk
                    to each other. And that's the way they would meet or keep in touch. This would
                    be I guess '89 that the Germans came down through Czechoslovakia, and...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These are the East Germans.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: These are East Germans, wanting to emigrate via Austria from Hungary.
                    But the border was closed. On the Hungarian side. When you went across those
                    borders on those days, there was barbed wire, there were watchtowers, pits for
                    examining the underside of vehicles. It was not an easy border. Hungary was
                    permeable, but it had real borders where the roads crossed. And then the
                    Hungarians decided they would take down the barbed wire fence. I still have a
                    piece of barbed wire framed from that barbed wire fence. And it was announced on
                    the weekly news program, Gjula Horn, the Foreign Minister, announced it on the
                    weekly news program. And those Germans, who had been camping on church grounds
                    in Budapest and at other locations, left and went into Austria. That was a major
                    thing, and that helped precipitate a lot of the problems that East Germany had.
                    You could say that was another way that Hungary was ahead.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>Hungary was also ahead, in a sense, just be virtue of how permeable its borders
                    were to information and how much contact Hungarians had with the outside world.
                    They had all these '56ers around. They would come back and visit. There was a
                    lot of visitation. When you went to Vienna, there would be streets in Vienna
                    where the signs would be in Hungarian. All the shopkeepers spoke Hungarian,
                    because Hungarians used to drive out there for three hours, get stuff, and drive
                    back. You drove across the border to Austria, and you wouldn't go a few hundred
                    yards when you'd see these big containers, like the containers you'd put in the
                    back of trucks and on ships, except they'd be in a field on the side of the road
                    and there would be washing machines, and dryers, and freezers spilling our of
                    the containers on the side of the road. Every other Hungarian car coming back to
                    Hungary would have some big appliance strapped on the roof. Plus, Hungary is
                    located right in the middle of Austria, Italy, Yugoslavia. Radio broadcasts and
                    television broadcasts easily reached them. So they were very aware of what was
                    going on in the outside world, which is another aspect of being prepared,
                    advanced.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in a way, in your contact with the academic
                        community, did you find a contrast with the Soviets? Were these much more
                        sophisticated people in a way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: I had more contact with them, so it's hard to make the comparison. I
                    had more direct contact. It was easier. They were very sophisticated people.
                    They were part of Western culture. There are the remains of a Roman settlement
                    on the Danube just outside Budapest. They participated in the Enlightenment and
                    the Reformation. In their studies, even though a course might be called Marxist
                    Leninism or dialectical materialism or something like that, in some universities
                    they would have read the Enlightenment philosophers. They would have read a lot
                    of the things that people in the West would have read in those courses. The
                    Hungarians used to say, “We're the only people who go into the revolving door
                    behind you, but come out ahead of you.” [laughter] Soviet academics were also
                    sophisticated, and there is a great tradition of scholarship. The difference is
                    more in the historical paths followed by the two countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When things started getting really tense, particularly in
                        Czechoslovakia, where East Germans were getting into the West German
                        embassy...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And East Germany was getting restive. I guess this is the
                        Fall of '89, this was a pretty tense time, wasn't it? Because it could have
                        gone the other way. How was this being played out in Hungary?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: Hungary was very, very supportive. They had reports from people who had
                    gone out to those countries. But the big thing was Gorbachev. The big thing was
                    the Soviet attitude toward all of this. And when it became clear that... earlier
                    Kadar had said, the traditional line is, “If you're not with us, you're against
                    us.” And Kadar reversed it, “If you are not against us, you are with us.” That's
                    basically what the Soviets said. The Soviets said they were not going to
                    intervene to save communist regimes in eastern Europe. They let developments
                    take place. And once that happened, that was the big reservation on everybody's
                    mind. And soon after that there was an agreement to pull Soviet troops out of
                    Hungary. To leave those bases.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time, really prior to the fall of the Berlin
                        Wall, were the Soviets doing anything? From your perspective, were they just
                        caught up in events and watching things, or were they trying to put things
                        back together again, in Hungary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: In Hungary... my perch may not have afforded me the real bird's eye
                    view on this, but I recall nothing that the Soviets were doing to try to stop
                    this. The Soviets had immense problems with reform at home, of course. And
                    sufficient problems with the United States on arms control agreements, which
                    were a big deal. There was SDI, pressure on military buildup, so the resource
                    question in the Soviet Union was a big one. The Soviets were trying to keep up
                    the arms race with the United States, do reforms at home, and Gorbachev was
                    trying to consolidate his position and think about whether what he wanted to do
                    was consistent with an unwilling appendage... an empire on its borders. As I
                    recall, this led to a hands-off attitude. There were all kinds of questions,
                    about how to deal with the Soviet Union, e.g. about the Soviet Memorial and the
                    Liberation Memorial, and what day should be celebrated as national day, and what
                    about Revolution Day, and all kinds of practicalities while the Hungarians were
                    going down this road. But I don't recall anything any major Soviet resistance. I
                    remember the Soviets would be selling... Soviet troops would be selling
                    gasoline, they'd be selling equipment...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there at all the feeling that the Hungarians were
                        surreptitiously arming if they have to go though another '56, or something
                        like that?McCARTHY: No. It wasn't at the level at all. Remember, it was
                        reform Communism at first, with no real challenge to anything sacrosanct,
                        and then Gorbachev approved of elections. Earlier, in 1988, there had been
                        demonstrations in the streets - some of them in opposition to a dam between
                        Hungary anCzechoslovakia, at Bosnagymaros on the Danube - and the police had
                        intervened with truncheons. Times were tense then. By fall 1988, though,
                        those demonstrations all went peacefully. The Hungarians commemorated 1956
                        with peaceful marches as well.</hi>

                        used to be a time when they'd commemorate 1956 with, “this is when the
                        glorious forces of the Soviet Union helped us repress these dirty rebels.”
                        Was this a different commemoration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes. It's hard to remember now, but the big issue was how you referred
                    to the events of 1956. The communist party had always referred to it as a
                    “counter- revolution.” Then in early 1989 Imre Pozsgay, the principal reform
                    communist, referred to it as a “national uprising.” This set off a fire -storm
                    of debate, covered by the media. Popular sentiment was in favor of calling it an
                    uprising, and this revisionism eventually led to the rehabilitation of Imre
                    Nagy, another major event.</p>

                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, exactly. Magyars, they were horsemen. Absolutely. That's exactly
                    the place. That's where they had the ceremonial reburying of Imre Nagy. There
                    was a coffin and coffins for others as well, as I recall, but it was mainly
                    about Imre Nagy. The coffin was tilted up, and you could see it from all over
                    the square. And the Hungarian tricolors, the Hungarian flags, were flapping
                    everywhere. They had the Soviet hammer and sickle cut out, or gouged out, so
                    you'd have a ragged, circular hole in the middle of these flags. That was the
                    way flags had flown in 1956, and you had a line of people coming up to the
                    square, circling the square and going by the casket and dropping in a flower. It
                    was a coming to terms with the past. The ceremony was permitted but it was not
                    governmental at all. It was on a major square, a square where there are many
                    commemorative events. And this was a public reflection of what 1956 meant to
                    Hungarians.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>There was another great day, beautiful fall day, October 23rd, when the Republic
                    was proclaimed. That was an anniversary of the 1956 uprising - so another
                    historical reference and commemoration... A big flag hanging out the window of
                    Parliament, and the whole square full of people, thousands and thousands,
                    100,000 people out there. I remember a police car coming through the crowd and I
                    was thinking, “Oh, no, this is bad.” But people just parted and the police drove
                    through.</p>
                <p>By the way, at the time, all these things were considered astonishing, like
                    acknowledging the revolution, letting the Germans out, a public ceremony for
                    Imre Nagy, who had been considered a traitor... he was executed, a new
                    constitution, public elections. It was a door that was swinging open, bit by bit
                    by bit by bit, and you tried to chock in some doorstops, or give it a little
                    extra nudge every time, but nobody, or at least I did not think, that it would
                    swing that far open with such far reaching results.</p>

                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: They were, but they were discredited. The party at the very top had
                    made the decision to reform. Everybody on the outside was supporting this and
                    nudging it forward in different ways. This tendency was getting support from
                    many quarters. The Hungarians had a big annual film festival, Budapest film
                    festival. A number of the films had archival footage of what had happened in
                    some of the small Hungarian towns in 1956. The past was being uncovered for all
                    to see. Summer of 1990, July, President Bush visited. This was a huge gesture of
                    support. (And by the way arranging the press support for hundreds of
                    accompanying journalists was a major challenge for us). He'd been in Poland, and
                    he came to Hungary. There were advertisements in the major papers, and I confess
                    to having advised against the advertisements (You know, we don't want to sell
                    the President the way we sell washing machines), and I was completely wrong. It
                    shows how your ideas can be stale. The advance team wanted to put these
                    advertisements in and they were right. It was a casual picture of the President
                    with information on when he was going to arrive to speak at Parliament. When he
                    came in, the streets were full of people with flags, in a drenching rain yet.
                    And it wasn't a forced turnout, it wasn't one of these totalitarian state things
                    where you, you know, this is your street corner, make sure you be there, here is
                    your flag, wave, okay, go back to work. People really wanted to be there. So,
                    the forces that didn't want change were minimal and marginalized.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the media there when you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: The media were very open and they had some very good people in the
                    media. We'd established very good contacts with the media through my
                    predecessor, as I said. They had two weekly current-events shows and a daily
                    newscast that were very, very good. The people had traveled to the West; the
                    anchor who did the panorama show spoke English, spoke Arabic, was very well
                    educated. The news people were very well educated. They'd been all around. Their
                    coverage was pretty fair. Three major newspapers had correspondents in the U.S.
                    They later came back to Hungary, and I knew them pretty well. It was good.
                    Funding could be a problem. If the Hungarians wanted to do an important story
                    from the U.S., for example, we worked out an arrangement with USIA where the
                    Hungarian journalists could use a studio. We would provide studio access and an
                    uplink for their program to bring it down in Hungary. USIA facilitated that. In
                    Budapest, whenever there was a prominent American in town, whether it was
                    Zbigniew Brzezinski, or Ambassador Eagleburger, by then I guess Deputy Secretary
                    Eagleburger, or Ambassador Schifter on human rights, we had little problem
                    getting them good television coverage. Our interests and the Hungarians
                    interests were the same in that respect. I was quite impressed. The media were
                    not controlled... This doesn't mean everything was problem-free, of course.
                    There was an incident and I don't remember what they left out... It was a big,
                    big deal at the time, but for my life I can't remember what the essence of it
                    was. But the Ambassador did an interview, and it was published in the paper, but
                    there was a key omission that made the Ambassador seem to be against some
                    element of reform. We called back, and they reran the interview with the right
                    words.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Hungarians beginning to play sort of like the
                        Western press in... this is before the fall of the Berlin Wall, I'm dividing
                        things off... In Moscow. Big things were happening of course. The Gorbachev
                        whirlwind was in the mix. Was there frequent reportage, Hungarian-wise, on
                        what was happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, there was. There was a letter written by... boy, it's a bit dim in
                    my mind now... by a Russian schoolteacher protesting the reforms and it got a
                    lot of play in the Russian press; the anti-reformers were backing it. That whole
                    incident got extensive coverage in Hungary, to cite one example.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the Hungarians were well aware of events in Moscow,
                        weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, very aware of events Moscow, and very aware that events in Moscow
                    were crucial to their future. They didn't look to Moscow for anything other than
                    permission, really. One of the great benefits of going from Communism to
                    non-Communism in Hungary versus going from Communism to non-Communism in the
                    Soviet Union is that in Hungary communism was imposed from the outside by the
                    Soviets. You know, 'They did this to us. They laid this thing on us. If it
                    weren't for that burden on our shoulders, we would be Austria.”' Hungarians
                    tended to look down on Russia, even, I would say grossly underestimate the
                    attainments of Russian culture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about language? By the time you were there, were the
                        students learning Russian more than English? How were things going
                        then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: It's interesting. Typical Hungarian sort of thing. Hungary had a lot of
                    Russian teachers. They had a commitment to teach a lot of Russian. The way it
                    tended to play out was that rural school districts had Russian teachers, but if
                    you were in an area with a lot of well-placed parents, upper-middle class
                    parents, you tended to have English teachers. And the English-teaching community
                    was extremely open to us. One of the big problems they had was, “What do we do
                    with all these Russian teachers, once students could choose what language to
                    study. Nobody WANTS to learn Russian. People are taking Russian because it's the
                    only language we give in some of these outlying districts,” where there was no
                    choice. So Hungary initiated a conversion program to prepare Russian teachers
                    how to be English teachers. And, the English teachers at the same time, wanted
                    to upgrade their skills and bring in new materials, etc. Our Regional English
                    Language Officer (the RELO), a member of the USIS staff, was extremely dynamic,
                    Greg Orr, and we would do things like: we would have a three-week seminar for
                    key secondary school teachers down on Lake Balaton every year; key people from
                    the university attended. We'd bring in experts from the United States and we'd
                    put on an intensive three-week program, including American culture and things
                    and information about the U.S. This was a time when we had “Family Album USA,”
                    which was a sort of a soap opera about an American family, the Stewart family,
                    family-oriented entertainment, with language teaching, on Hungarian television.
                    So, you'd follow this family through its day and the children and the wife and
                    the shopping and the conflicts within the family. At the end, there would be a
                    recap of some of the expressions. She said, “Get lost.” What does this mean?
                    Here is what it means. They'd go through idioms. It was very good. I mean, I
                    used to watch it even. It was sort of fun.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>So, yes, they did teach Russian; no, it was not wanted; they had to figure out
                    how to deal with it politically. They were very open to us; this was great
                    entree into the educational system. And, when the Peace Corps came in ...
                    another “we're not patronizing” challenge, which took a long time. You know, the
                    Hungarians would say 'We are not a backwater that needs to have volunteers come
                    in and teach us how to have clean water.” So, the Peace Corps was there to teach
                    English, to offer English-speakers, to help the school system. Our RELO went all
                    around Hungary - We offered him up for six weeks - with the Peace Corps
                    representative, while they figured out where these volunteers were going to go.
                    Then those Peace Corps volunteers... what wonderful resources for us. They would
                    use our materials and get materials into the classrooms. We also had English
                    LanguagFellows, USIA-sponsored educators with advanced degrees in English as a
                    Second Language. The English Language Fellows were in the pedagogical institutes
                    where the teachers were being prepared, whereas the great majority of Peace
                    Corps volunteers were teaching in local classrooms. So there was a sort of a
                    layered system. We would try to help with the Russian - to-English
                    transformation program. Some of the Peace Corps volunteers were in that. I don't
                    know that that really worked out exceptionally well... The Hungarians also had
                    special high schools where... they always had schools where the courses were
                    taught in English. They initiated what they called, “the zero year high school.”
                    They had a competitive test, and if you got in, you spent the first year on
                    intensive English language study and then you took all your subjects in English.
                    Under the Fulbright teacher exchange program we broughEnglish teachers to go
                    into those ultra-elite high schools and work on those programs.</p>
                <p>And there were other special foreign-language schools in some of Hungarian
                    cities. In some cases we arranged partnerships with American schools, and in
                    other cases arranged to have American teachers placed in those schools. So in a
                    variety of ways, they were very open to English, the American version of
                    English, although there was some lingering prejudice against American English
                    versus British English. The British council was there; in some countries it can
                    be a competitive relationship; there, it was very harmonious, largely because of
                    our Regional English Language Officer his excellent FSN assistant, who stressed
                    cooperation.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about German? This is middle Europe and the theory
                        has been Germany would sort of take... what was happening there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: That's right. People of a certain age would often speak German. You
                    could speak German with them. They were involved in business activities, and
                    particularly close to the border there was a lot of joint business activity. As
                    time went by, Germans became quite involved economically there. There were some
                    people who wanted to learn German, but, you know, for a country like Hungary
                    with a language that nobody else was going to speak, your key to the outside
                    world was really English. That's really where your future was, and that was why
                    they recognized it. Plus there was all the pop culture appeal.</p>

                <p>McCARTHY: Public affairs officer in Hungary from 1988 to 1992.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Fall of '89, as it came from summer of '89, did
                        you look upon this and say, 'Oh, we're coming to a momentous time', or how
                        did you feel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: I thought about this after our last conversation... My memory is of
                    being impressed by what was happening in Czechoslovakia and Germany, knowing how
                    important it was, but of being preoccupied with Hungary and sensing that Hungary
                    was preoccupied with Hungary. I think there are a couple of reasons for that.
                    One of the main reasons is that in Czechoslovakia and in the DDR at that time,
                    there were bottom-up movements that forced political change at the top
                    reluctantly. Big demonstrations that were repressed, got out of control,
                    enlarged, and ultimately led to the overthrow of the regimes. Nothing gradual
                    about it.</p>
                <p>Whereas in Hungary, there was a relatively reformist Communist party at the top,
                    and it was pushed from below by popular elements. And that party had done a lot.
                    Those large demonstrations that we talked about last time, against the dam, the
                    Bosnagymaros Dam, they permitted that. Even in September/October 1988, there was
                    a huge demonstration that was not suppressed and the government suspended work
                    on the project, even though it was joint Czechoslovakia-Hungary project designed
                    to supply power to Austria.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>Another example was permitting Hungary to recover its past. We talked about the
                    Imre Nagy rehabilitation, but also, prior to 1989, on March 15th which was the
                    memorial of the 1848 repression of the Hungarian revolt by Russian troops, there
                    had been unofficial demonstrations. A stand-in for '56, really, and they were
                    repressed. In 1989, in March, however, that march was permitted and officially
                    sanctioned. You had 30,000 people participating in the official commemoration -
                    almost like the Stations of the Cross, going around Hungary, stopping at
                    landmarks. The opposition still did their own 100,000-person commemoration
                    because they didn't want to be co-opted. Don't hold me to the figures. The point
                    is that the attitude of the regime toward expressions of popular sentiments was
                    different in Hungary. So that I think is one of the reasons that those events in
                    Czechoslovakia and Germany, although important, didn't seem to be pushing
                    Hungary along. Hungary had its own dynamic.</p>
                <p>In fall 1989 we had the October Leipzig demonstrations and in November the
                    demonstrations in Czechoslovakia. In Hungary we were coming to the end of
                    roundtable negotiations that had lasted six months or so between the opposition,
                    and the Communist party, and quasi-front organizations. They were concluding
                    with a lot of changes recommended for the constitution, and a lot of changes
                    regarding legality and governance and a host of other important changes. In
                    September, as we discussed last time, Hungary cut the wire on the Austrian
                    border. That was another example of Hungary sort of going its way, although it
                    meant breaking a long-standing agreement with East Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.McCARTHY: East Germany had built a wall to keep
                        people in, but the deal was don't let people out someplace else. But Hungary
                        decided that its political imperatives required it to do that. So, coming up
                        to that fall period, there were events in Hungary that were completely
                        absorbing. On October 23rd, as we mentioned last time, the Hungarian
                        Republic, not the democratic republic, the Hungarian Republic was
                        established, 100,000 people out in front of Parliament. That's the time when
                        the Leipzig demonstrations were very big.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they do anything to the flag?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, changed the flag.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Get rid of that...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, completely different. And there were endless discussions. Another
                    example of something that absorbed the country. There were endless discussions
                    about what should be in the flag. The crown of Saint Stephen with the tilted
                    cross? Some representation of Transylvania, the green part, etc.? And, anther
                    preoccupation of Hungary, through that whole period, was the status of
                    Hungarians living in Romania as a minority... one and three-quarter million or
                    so... big demonstrations about that, too. The news that was coming out of
                    Romania was magnified in Hungary all the time, Ceausescu was then trying to
                    eradicate villages and establish large, industrial, agricultural cooperatives,
                    and the feeling was that he was trying to eradicate Hungarian village life. So,
                    any time there was an atrocity, or a priest was prevented from practicing, or a
                    Hungarian language publication was suppressed, that was big news in Hungary.
                    There was a large movement that kept that in the forefront, the Hungarian
                    Democratic Forum, and they took part in the election later. Hungary was so
                    intent on sort of...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This must have given Hungarians talking to you an awful
                        lot of pride... I mean, saying, “Look, we're doing away with this thing, and
                        we're doing away in our way.” For example, were you hearing any jokes about
                        Hungarians versus Czechs, versus Germans, Romanians, and that? Because,
                        often, that's the way these things are expressed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Right. No jokes spring to mind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: But, yes, people were extremely proud, and their point of reference
                    wasn't Czechoslovakia or Poland. Their point of reference was Austria, their
                    former partner in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. What they felt was, “If we hadn't
                    been forced to wear this straight jacket, we would be where Austria is. That's
                    our rightful place.” Going back to what USIA was doing at that time, if I can
                    put in a plug here, as its constitution was coming to fruition around October of
                    1989, we had already been working with the justice ministry since the Fall of
                    1988 on this. The drafters of the constitution had gone to the United States on
                    the International Visitors Program. We had suggested some sort of conference and
                    the Hungarians ran with that and made it an international constitutional
                    conference involving a dozen different countries, including the United States
                    and many of the Western European countries, presenting papers on the
                    constitution. Frankly, I think the Hungarian interest was more in building up
                    international solidarity for what they were doing, and drawing attention to what
                    they were doing to stimulate it, than it was in learning. But, all through this
                    process, there was enormous pride. One of the things from the standpoint of a
                    U.S. government official, particularly in USIA, that you have to bear in mind
                    all the time, was to avoid even a hint that you were patronizing or teaching.
                    Everything was presented in terms of a joint effort, as it was, because people
                    in the United States were extremely interested in learning about developments in
                    Hungary. Hungary was on the crest of the wave there, until October or so, and
                    events were changing so quickly that even specialists couldn't keep track. So in
                    the context of all those joint things that we did together, there was enormous
                    pride.Q: How did you find your home office responded, because you must have had
                    lots of requests for things. Because here is something opening up that we've
                    been planning for throughout the... for the last forty years or so, but when the
                    time came, were you able to get stuff out...</p>
                <p>McCARTHY: The home office was great. They redirected money internally. And then
                    we had the Support for East European Democracy Act, 1990 I think, and we had
                    funds for that. For example, in 1991 or so, we had 57 Fulbrighters. Hungary is a
                    country of ten million people, so that's an enormous input of resources for us,
                    and, as I mentioned, those Fulbrighters, although they were teaching, were also
                    encouraged to get involved in practical work as well, in their areas of
                    expertise.</p>
                <p>When we got to the elections, USIA came in very big again. They established two
                    special chairs, one in economics/small business development, and one in
                    political science and history. We had several Fulbrighters involved in important
                    undertakings, like developing a civics curriculum for Hungary (a Hungarian
                    Fulbright professor and an American Fulbright professor worked on that jointly.
                    In fact the American expert Professor Joe Julian of Syracuse University,
                    subsequently devoted a number of years to promoting civics education in that
                    part of the world).</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>Another area where USIA provided exceptional support was in our effort to improve
                    local governance. As the political system changed in Hungary, more power
                    devolved to the regions and the cities outside Budapest. An American professor
                    with extensive hands-on experience, Terry Buss, spearheaded our local government
                    program. The model was roughly this: (a) visit a city, listen carefully, present
                    an overview of what might be done, respond to specific concerns, and figure out
                    the next important item on that city's agenda (b) provide relevant material to
                    the city, develop a seminar/workshop in response to the most pressing agenda
                    item for that city, and return to engage local leadership on that issue,
                    including specialized expertise as needed. In essence this became an extended
                    dialogue over several years. The basic framework was set at the beginning of the
                    project, but one phase built on the preceding one, depending upon local needs.
                    This outreach involved academic institutions, local government, and business
                    representatives. It was highly collaborative and participatory. Keeping a
                    project like that on track required a great deal of attention and flexibility
                    from USIA, and our Washington colleagues really came through for us.</p>
                <p>So, in a word, USIA was very good. Our system was to have an annual country plan
                    for each country, and every year I found I had to rewrite the country plan.
                    Normally, when you redo the country plan, it's an edit... it doesn't change that
                    much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you move into late Fall, and things are really popping
                        in Czechoslovakia first with the refugees, the people going to seek asylum
                        at the Western German embassy, and then things started happening. In a way,
                        that pressure wasn't there in Hungary, was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: That pressure was not there because free travel was already permitted
                    for Hungarians, traveled back and forth. On one of those big days - think it was
                    maybe the March 15th demonstration in 1989 - was also one of the biggest days
                    for shopping in Vienna that anybody can remember. Half of Hungary celebrated,
                    and half of Hungary went out to Mariahilferstrasse in Vienna, where all the
                    storekeepers spoke Hungarian, and loaded up on goods.</p>
                <p>But you had things that were going on that generated a lot of pressure. In
                    October of that year, one of the big, big things was that the original plan
                    coming out of the roundtable discussions was to have a presidential election
                    immediately and a parliamentary election later. Two of the political parties
                    rejected that. The assumption was that Imre Pozsgay, who was the lead, liberal
                    Communist, would win the presidential election. In a way that victory would have
                    legitimized the role of communism. But the SzDSz, the League of Free Democrats,
                    decided that they would push to have the election for president postponed. They
                    had a referendum campaign, and it was known as the “Four Egens” the “four
                    yes's.” The big “yes” was on postponing the presidential vote, and the people
                    decided Yes, to postpone the vote. Once that happened, the parties had enough
                    time to organize and to mount a real campaign, and we were able to provide
                    election support.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>So, that was another thing that was happening in that fall period. It wasn't that
                    Hungary was just sort of coasting along on this gradual uphill l trajectory, as
                    everything else was exploding. There were moments that, in Hungarian terms, were
                    extremely critical where developments could have gone either way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say that you were giving out election support. This is
                        kind of subversive, isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Well, yes, in some ways. It was primarily the National Endowment for
                    Democracy: the National Democratic Institute (NDI), and the International
                    Republican Institute. Each sent in people, and they also involved Europeans from
                    party institutes. They did seminars. This was not USIA funded. They did seminars
                    for people working on the campaign, but they did not back any one particular
                    party.</p>
                <p>What USIA did, as I recall, was send some of the party campaign managers to the
                    United States on the International Visitors Program. Our preference was to do
                    what other people were not doing. One of the big challenges in a place like
                    Hungary, where suddenly it becomes hot and everybody wants to help, was, number
                    one, pick an area that you are really good at and have a unique advantage and
                    focus on that. Don't duplicate what everybody else was going to do. And, number
                    two, get out of Budapest, because the people that fly in short-term are going to
                    be limited to the capital pretty much. We worked with some groups in the
                    capital, of course, but we focused on important regional centers outside
                    Budapest, as I mentioned earlier, we worked on the parliamentary research
                    capability more than on the election, while others worked in country on the
                    election itself. We sent some of the staff from the Library of Parliament to the
                    United States to look at what the Library of Congress did.</p>
                <p>As its role expanded, Parliament was to use the former communist Central
                    Committee building for itself. That was development that made Hungarians proud I
                    remember walking through that huge, well not huge but large by Budapest
                    standards, block building, within walking distance of Parliament. That's where
                    we used to go for meetings with Central Committee staff. It was all very formal,
                    designed to be intimidating. Then, less than two years later you walk through
                    this building and it's absolutely deserted and you could actually hear your
                    footsteps echoing through the halls as you walked, with, I think, people from
                    Congress. You go to the old office that Kadar used to have in the olden days.
                    You see this special elevator he had, just off his office that went down to the
                    basement. On those occasions, people were very proud. These things just
                    symbolized change so dramatically. Or, the first session of the newly elected
                    Parliament, when it was seated.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>That was another instance of, to return to your earlier point, people, bursting
                    with pride with what they did. But in terms of was it subversive to offer
                    election assistance, I think we were squarely behind reform and we wanted to do
                    anything possible to make that election campaign work. The Hungarian government
                    was behind the election too after all. There was nothing we did that favored one
                    political party over the other. This was advice given to all the managers of all
                    the parties, in a technical sense. The communists, never showed any desire to
                    participate, so that question never came up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you all watching the Communist cadre, I mean the
                        hardcore... hardcore might be the wrong term... the old apparatchiks digging
                        in and seeing that their days are numbered, and what they were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, not only we, but the Hungarian communists party - they called
                    themselves the Hungarian Socialist Worker's Party - watched that happen. The
                    party actually reconstituted itself, renamed itself as the Hungarian Socialist
                    Party. A small splinter group of those “hardcore” you mention broke off and
                    formed their own Communist party. They participated in the elections and
                    whatnot, but they did very poorly. The thing that you worried about with the
                    party was, one, were they really going to reform and were they going to permit
                    all the popular motion from below, were they going to accommodate it or at some
                    point was it going to seem too threatening and were they going to try to stop it
                    at some point; and two, what were the levers available to them if they wanted
                    to. Under communism there was a worker's militia, “the Munkasorseg.” They were
                    formed after '56 and were subordinate to the communist party, potentially a
                    clear threat. Another lever of control was communist cells at the workplace.
                    That was a way to control things, like getting out the vote and who you'd vote
                    for, and to relate awards at work to political support. The cells and the
                    militia were dispensed with, as part of the “four yes's” referendum, and that
                    really reduced options for the hard core. The bulk of the party, which had
                    declared itself the Hungarian Socialist Party, were initially confident about
                    the election. So, the struggle against reform was not in the foreground the way
                    it was in Russia. You didn't know how far resistance to reform would go, but
                    there were so many factors working against resistance, that at a certain point,
                    it didn't seem that threatening. Unlike in Russia, a lot of reform was identical
                    to nationalism.</p>

                <p>McCARTHY: It did. It had a solid core of those people. That's another milestone
                    in recapturing the past, dealing with the past, and presenting the past. The
                    secret police headquarters at Andrashi ut No. 60 I think, was opened up. First
                    of all, a memorial plaque was put on it, saying what it was, and commemorating
                    people lost. Then he building was later opened up to the public (after I had
                    left), acknowledging the role of the secret police. Just what happened to
                    individuals who'd been working for the secret police I don't know. There wasn't
                    the same frustration that you had in Czechoslovakia, where they'd publish lists.
                    There was the search for the “red brick in the wall” - members of purportedly
                    democratic institutions who were still “red.” But there was surprisingly little
                    retribution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this play out, then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: It played out that the party reconstituted itself, it participated in
                    the elections, the other parties participated in the elections...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Elections were when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Elections were in the spring of 1990. And these were the first
                    absolutely free elections in East-Central Europe. The Poles had an election that
                    was almost free, and non-communists won any seat they were eligible to capture,
                    so it was clear the handwriting was on the wall. But in these elections it was
                    actually 100 percent. The Hungarian Democratic Forum won. The Alliance of Free
                    Democrats and FIDESZ did well, and the Hungarian Democratic forum formed a
                    government. The success of these parties demonstrated the importance of earlier
                    permissiveness under communism: you could have groups outside of party control
                    and you could have social organizations, citizens could collect signatures on
                    street corners protesting Hungarian environmental policies. These same groups
                    later became political parties and ran in the election. The Hungarian Democratic
                    Forum, for example, had started as one of those groups. You were asking before,
                    earlier, about samizdat, and things like that. The Alliance of Free Democrats
                    was composed largely of urban resisters of Communism, who had written for
                    samizdat publications earlier. Later these works were available openly.</p>
                <p>The free availability of what had been samizdat was tracked as an indicator of
                    freedom, of democracy. Publications that had previously been samizdat were sold
                    in sidewalk stalls. Transcripts of radio broadcasts from 1956 were sold on the
                    street corners. The study of the 1956 revolution that was conducted was printed
                    and sold on the street corners. Translated works that weren't available
                    previously were sold. Maps of a large Hungary, including Transylvania and parts
                    of Slovakia, were sold on the street.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about pictures of people like Nagy and those
                        absolutes, were they appearing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: No hero worship, but figures, particularly Nagy on that June 16, I
                    think it was, commemoration. His re-interment really, well, he was interred
                    after the ceremony. Pictures of Nagy were everywhere that day. I still have one,
                    a small flag with a picture Nagy. They came in all sizes and shapes. But there
                    wasn't a cult of personality around anybody.</p>

                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, but once the wire was officially cut, then it was really clear.
                    But earlier, you already had groups coming into Hungary, camping, and then
                    moving toward the border and going across the border. The Germans would try
                    initially, as you said, you know, they're in the embassies... every person of
                    German extraction was automatically given German citizenship then. So they'd try
                    to get a document and go across. But then after a while they were just going
                    across.</p>

                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: You'd think there would be, although I don't remember that. The Germans
                    went on through to Germany, so I don't think they were considered a burden to
                    the Austrian state. You know, they wanted to go to where they were going to be
                    given citizenship - the Bundesrepublik - so that was where they went.Q: So that
                    was the waypoint.</p>

                <p>McCARTHY: Standoff.</p>

                <p>McCARTHY: As I recall, any standoff did not last long, if there was one. But
                    frankly I don't remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the intellectual class? I assume there was one.
                        Were they a particular point of focus of your work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, not just individual intellectuals but the university community,
                    book publishers, who reached intellectuals. We had a very active book
                    publication program. Rather than try to print up books, ship them in, and
                    distribute them, we tried to find win-win propositions with Hungarian
                    publishers. And there were some very, very good Hungarian publishers. The
                    arrangement would be something like this. “We will get the copyright for you. We
                    will pay you a modest sum, say $4,000 or something, to offset the cost of
                    translation, etc. You can then print this book in up to 100,000 copies, whatever
                    it happened to be... that would be very large, it wouldn't be that big... but up
                    to some amount of copies. We will take back 400, which we would then use as
                    presentation items or in seminars, etc., and the rest of the copies you sell and
                    distribute to libraries.”</p>
                <p>And that would be aimed really indirectly at the educated class.Q: What kind of
                    books were these?</p>
                <p>McCARTHY: These would be everything from books on economics, Samuelson for
                    example, to important works on American history related to what was going on,
                    like the Federalist Papers, the Constitution; de Tocqueville's Democracy n
                    America, to practical guides that related to the new challenges that people in
                    that country were going to have to meet, like starting a new business, preparing
                    a business plan, novels; science, Carl Sagan. What we wanted to do was present a
                    rich overview of the United States and also try to include works that were
                    particularly relevant to Hungary at that time. We were making up for lost time,
                    in a sense. Of course, there had to be a market.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Soviets... were they just sort of standing back and
                        shaking their heads? Or were...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Well, Gorbachev had let everybody know that the Soviet Union wasn't
                    going to intervene to save any of these regimes. The Soviet Union agreed to
                    withdraw all its troops from Hungary by summer 1991, which they did. They did
                    not like some of the disparagement of legitimate Soviet achievements, like the
                    war memorial to the liberation of Hungary. So there were some neuralgic points,
                    and when the Soviets left their bases, there was a lot of controversy over the
                    environmental impact - what they had taken with them, things that were in the
                    soil, and whatnot. I walked through some of those barracks, and nothing was
                    left. But none of that played any role in trying to slow down processes in
                    Hungary, as I recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were then until when?</hi>
                </p>

                        elected president. He had been imprisoned earlier, and then he reinvented
                        himself as a translator and an author. A wise, gentle, astute person who was
                        acceptable to all sides. He was elected and re-elected. Joseph Antall was
                        Prime Minister.</hi>

                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: It really was. And it depended largely on that referendum campaign to
                    postpone the election date. By that time, you'd seen communism on the skids in
                    politburos and parties in Germany and Czechoslovakia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel that the people in power were really
                        running scared, or were they, maybe it was a Hungarian trait that they would
                        go along with it... make the best of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: I don't recall any retrograde sort of resistance, any suggestion that
                    any legal measures were going to be taken to reverse this. You had large,
                    popular support, the reform party had participated in the elections, the world
                    around was watching, Hungary wanted to come into the EU, did not want the
                    Russian embrace. Everybody basically felt that the old arrangements didn't work,
                    so what was the alternative, really. There wasn't any stomach, I think, for
                    trying to establish anything by force. They'd just seen what happened to regimes
                    that tried to hang on and they'd seen Ceausescu killed on Christmas day in
                    Romania...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On TV.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, and Gorbachev was hands-off, so even if you were a
                    dyed-in-the-wool Communist who didn't like what was going on, you wouldn't see
                    any options for yourself.Q: How about with Romania? After Ceausescu left,
                    Hungary gets reformed, but you've still got a million Hungarians living in
                    Romania, what...?</p>
                <p>McCARTHY: And whatnot. Exactly. That continued to be a problem, and there
                    continued to be incidents, but Hungary didn't open up its borders and let a flow
                    of Hungarian-Romanians in either, because there was an economic aspect to that.
                    It's blurring in my mind but there were definitely incidents that inflamed
                    public opinion in Hungary. There were bilateral meetings. (End of tape)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying there were a lot of bilateral
                        meetings...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: Well, at least I can think of one big one. There were many issues to
                    discuss, regarding Hungarian minority rights and how Hungary could be supportive
                    without intervening in Romanian affairs. There was also concern when the Prime
                    Minister proclaimed himself prime minister of fifteen million Hungarians, when
                    everybody knew that only ten million resided in Hungary. The Hungarian
                    Democratic Forum, which had a major platform plank on the Hungarian minority in
                    Romania, was careful to say that didn't mean intervention. There were maps
                    published, available on the streets of Budapest, that showed a larger Hungary
                    that included the Transylvanian part of Romania as lying in Hungary. There was
                    the government-to-government relationship on this, and there was the popular
                    feeling about this since people had relatives and they were very close. All
                    these were matters for bilateral discussion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, is there anything else that we should cover that you
                        were doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes. This was the ideal opportunity for a USIA office to work. This is
                    what you really pray for. You work for decades to try to introduce strands of
                    information, freedom, communication, set up dialogs between institutions of the
                    two countries, expose Americans to Hungary, and Hungarians to America, have some
                    impact on the curriculum. And suddenly everything is reforming and the big
                    challenge is to pick your targets and focus on them so you can continue to
                    address them in different ways with different resources over time and not
                    exhaust yourself along a thousand trails. That was one of the big advantages to
                    having a bottom up/top down revolution, because you didn't have it reversed all
                    the time. The Hungarians did it, obviously. Bit it was wonderful to help
                    out.</p>
                <p>In addition to what we've already discussed, I guess the only other thing that I
                    would mention as being particularly important was setting up a network of six
                    student advising centers in partnership with the Soros Foundation. Hungarian
                    students were smart, well educated, and wanted to study in the United States but
                    they needed to know what the opportunities were. A number of them got
                    scholarships, using those educational advising centers.</p>

                    And everybody who was with us, everybody who worked in USIA, said, “That was a

                    are going from a country of one time zone and ten million people, ethnically
                    homogeneous, who have the luxury of putting all the blame on the Soviet Union,
                    to a country that goes across eleven time zones, has 150 million people, lots of
                    different ethnic groups, and in which reform is by no means guaranteed. There
                    was an attempted coup the year before I got there, the attempted coup against
                    Gorbachev, that was still fresh in people's minds, and all the arrangements were
                    being worked out. The Soviet Union had collapsed just seven, eight months before
                    I got there. So things were very much in flux, and you had reform from the top,
                    but not really control over the situation. You had a lot of movement from the
                    bottom, but not with the same track record that you had in Hungary and not with
                    the same support. The big challenge was, how do you make an impact with your
                    small staff in this immense country? At that time we were still suffering the
                    effects of no Foreign Service national employees. The Foreign Service national
                    employees for USIA were essential. They were real [a real asset].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Absolutely. For everywhere.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes. But there is a difference, when, because of classified working
                    space, the FSN works in one place, and you are up behind a classified area.
                    That's a little different from really working cheek by jowl and you pop into
                    each other's offices all the time, you share work, you talk about things. There
                    aren't many things off limits really that I can't talk to my FSNs about, you
                    know. So, just to get back to my point, there were no FSNs. We had a contract
                    with Pacific Architects and Engineers (PA&amp;E), and their staff members were
                    called PA&amp;Eers. We had, I think, three of those in Moscow, and I must say
                    they were superb, but there were only three. That was the year the Freedom of
                    Support Act passed. So we had, about six months after I got there, something
                    like $100 million worth of exchanges money coming our way. So, the challenge for
                    me as a manager was to conceptualize what it was we had to do, realizing that
                    you couldn't retail things the same way as you could in Hungary. You had to look
                    for big multipliers. Who could multiply things for you? Who could you work with
                    who could then have an impact on others?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador when you went out there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: The ambassador, when I first got there, was Ambassador Straus, who was
                    burning up the lines to Congress about things like aid to Russia and everything,
                    as you know, very, very well connected.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I just finished up another session with him
                        yesterday.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Oh, did you? That must be the most engaging...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, it is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Oh. [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter] Wonderful, wonderful man.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Oh, God. He would have these meetings with American correspondents,
                    these sessions over in Spaso House. They'd be sitting in concentric rings, and
                    he'd be a master. He'd keep them entertained and informed for 45 minutes to an
                    hour of informal questions and discussions. It was great.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You got to manage this. How did you approach your job?
                        What do feel you were managing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: A very large exchange program and extensive information outreach. And
                    in connection with both I was managing relationships with a variety of
                    intermediary organizations. This gets back to how USIA works, and again the
                    tremendous support from Washington. The big USIA programs - International
                    Visitors, Fulbright, special Freedom Support Act initiatives - are all carried
                    out in partnership with non-governmental organizations. For example, for the
                    Fulbright exchange, it's the Council on International Exchange of Scholars that
                    does most of the implementation work on the exchange of scholars. The Institute
                    of International Education that does most of the implementation on the exchange
                    of Fulbright students. We worked through those organizations to implement
                    exchanges on our behalf. Those NGOs were multipliers, bringing great expertise
                    and commitment.</p>
                <p>In Russia, prior to the fall of Communism, under the old Soviet Union, as I
                    mentioned, we used to have a bilateral agreement on educational and cultural
                    exchanges. There was a protocol that would go over two years, which would
                    specify exactly what would happen. USIA had been working with some of those NGOs
                    for years during the communist period. Now the numbers were vastly larger and
                    the focus was on reform. But the USIA-NGO relationships were there and the
                    expertise and hands-on experience were there on both sides. Other NGOs came on
                    board as opportunities expanded.</p>
                <p>So, what my colleagues and I did work with organizations that were managing
                    exchanges in Russia, to increase their capacity by increasing their grants and
                    by letting them take on additional staff to do work in Russia. And we were very
                    fortunate, because the American alumni of the various exchange programs loved
                    living in Russia. Anybody who studied Russia and Russian history in the Soviet
                    era had this love-hate relationship with that country. There's just no way
                    around it. They're drawn back to it like moths to the flame. And so someone who
                    had spent a year there on an academic exchange leapt at the chance to go out
                    there and work in an office of IREX (the International Research and Exchanges
                    Board) or of ACTR, (the American Council of Teachers of Russian), or the ACC
                    (the American Collegiate Consortium), and run exchange programs. Advertise them,
                    get the applications, have national panels. So, our job was to keep in touch
                    with those on the educational exchange side, keep in touch with those
                    organizations, direct them, set the policy guidelines, and intervene as
                    necessary. Some of their offices were outside of Moscow and that was all to the
                    good. On the press side, it was a very, very big press operation. All the
                    networks had bureaus in Moscow, as did the wire services and the major
                    newspapers. You could have a camera crew on anything, not that they'd come just
                    because you wanted them to, but they were there to cover real news. So, the
                    ambassador's schedule, schedules of visiting delegations (we had congressional
                    delegations all the time) presented opportunities. We had a Presidential visit
                    the first January I was there, and another one later. We had the
                    Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission, which meant at least one vice presidential visit
                    every year. Lots of Cabinet secretaries all the time. In short, there were
                    non-stop opportunities to engage the press, using the various VIP visits.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>The ambassadors also generated press coverage. Ambassador Collins succeeded
                    Ambassador Straus... He was the DCM and became the Charge after Ambassador
                    Straus left. He was terrific also. He was a former exchange student there, in
                    the late '50s, in fact I think he had roomed with the foreign minister. He was
                    very attuned to Russian culture, Russian language, Russian history, was able to
                    articulate our position very sensitively.</p>
                <p>And then Ambassador Pickering came, another tremendous ambassador. So the
                    leadership at the top was always excellent, which really helped, and the staffs
                    there were very good throughout in all the sections. So, when managing the
                    public diplomacy portfolio, you tried to work with your colleagues too - more
                    multipliers. You tried to get out of the embassy and leave an institutional
                    presence. One way we did that, and this was because of the Freedom of Support
                    Act, was to establish information centers in some of the regional cities. These,
                    again, were partnerships and were presented as partnerships. What we proposed
                    was, “We will give you a small reference library, we will provide texts of
                    recent journal articles on CD-ROM. We will provide Internet connectivity and
                    student advising materials. You have to provide space, staff and staff salaries,
                    and utilities. We will train the staff. And this will be a partnership. We tried
                    this idea out in several places, picking regional centers, like Yekaterinburg,
                    Nizhniy Novgorod, and Rostov. We succeeded in establishing these centers over
                    the course of several years. It was complicated to do, and they illustrated our
                    approach: “You can't get there yourself, so you have to work with others who can
                    get there for you or with you.” Erik Johnson, an Information Resources Officer
                    who came to Russia later, expanded the number of centers greatly. They became
                    known as “American Corners” and ultimately served as a model for a new worldwide
                    program.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find the entrenched bureaucracy more of a problem
                        there than you did in Hungary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes. Well, yes and no. I think it was a little harder “sell” to talk
                    about openly-advertised merit-based competition where you identify the best and
                    the brightest based on applications submitted from you know not whom and you
                    knew not whence, and only when you see them do you realize that there are these
                    diamonds out there. The going-in Russian position, because this was a system
                    they knew, was that they should select candidates themselves. They wanted to
                    avoid embarrassments. They said that we needed to get the best people, and the
                    only way to do that was to use their knowledge and contactThat would be the best
                    “take” on their position. The worst “take” on it would be, “This is an old boy
                    network, this is a good thing. People want to go to the United States; I want to
                    be associated with it. This will be patronage for me, and I would prefer to
                    remain in control of it, thank you.” So that was a long haul, really, getting
                    past that initial position.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>But people whose hearts were in the right place saw that these competitions
                    yielded fabulous candidates in a way that would have been possible in no other
                    way, and the impact on the individuals and the individuals' locations and
                    families was dramatic. You have a high school kid, in third year, out someplace
                    behind God's back in Siberia. (Future Leader Exchange Program), backed by
                    Senator Bradley, funded by the Freedom of Support Act.. The student would go to
                    the United States, go to an American high school, live with an American family,
                    and go back. And, people would say, “How did you do that? You don't know
                    anybody. Your family isn't connected. You're like us.” And that message, sent
                    through those exchange programs was as important, I think, as anything we put
                    out in written form, outlining American values and beliefs. The proof of the
                    pudding was in the eating. We didn't just talk the talk. We walked the walk.
                    Exchanges reached out into all 89 subjects of the federation, as they call them,
                    all 89 constituent parts of Russia.</p>
                <p>In sum, bureaucracy was frustrating in some ways, but the chaotic state of so
                    many thingincluding bureaucracy, opened up opportunities too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the collapsing nature of the Soviet Union affect
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, I think it did. I think it influenced our approach. The big bucks
                    were in the exchanges, and the philosophy was “You really don't know which one
                    of these horses is going to be out in front at any given time, and you really
                    don't know which is going to win the race. But you know that if this country is
                    ever going to succeed, and if they are going to become some version of a market
                    economy and some version of a democracy, they're going to need people who have a
                    democratic point of view and are educated in key fields like business
                    management, economics, public administration law, journalism, etc.” Our theory
                    was, “Select the right field, have an open competition, really get the word out,
                    have an unbiased selection mechanism, select the best people to go into those
                    fields, and ensure they have a worthwhile experience in the United States. They
                    come back into important institutions, they hold democratic views, they rise up
                    in those institutions; gradually, those institutions change. Those institutions
                    are ultimately what the society needs, and the society changes with them. Again,
                    it's only a part, a small part of what had to happen in Russia, or the other
                    countries in transition, but it was an important part. W thought that our
                    comparative advantage lay in that area rather than trying to retail a lot of
                    individualized rifle shot programs, although, we did some of that, too. As I
                    mentioned with regard to Hungary, exchange programs also let us engage the
                    leadership of the future on issues of central importance to the United States
                    and to Russia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the intelligence services? This thing had been
                        honed to control Russian activities since the czars' time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Forever. So, here's an old dog learning new tricks. You
                        were messing around right where they didn't want any. Basically, the
                        philosophy had been to keep foreigners from messing around.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Except that the avowed policy of the Russian government was reform.
                    Regional leaders, legislators would look upon this as a good thing when people
                    came from their districts, had this exchange opportunity, and came back. I think
                    the FSB, or whatever the intelligence service happened to be called at any given
                    time, had bigger fish to fry than this. Remember, you had people coming in who
                    were treasury advisors going into the Finance Ministry; they were building
                    housing for military officers who came back from east central Europe. We were
                    working jointly on a space program; we had Nunn-Lugar money to dispose of
                    nuclear weapons. These programs had greater security implications. I think that
                    would be more where the intelligence service would direct its attention.
                    However, we encountered intelligence service interest occasionally, when the
                    Office of Research did opinion polling outside of Moscow, for example. You'd get
                    blowback on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got there, it was all Russian, it was no longer
                        Soviet.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Russian media? How did you find dealing with
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: The Russian media were mixed. There was just a tremendous variety in
                    the Russian media. From the crusading, to the “let's try to get it right,” to
                    the “this is my little niche” to “I'm going to become completely irresponsible
                    and just say whatever I want, in order to sell papers.” Our approach to the
                    situation was this.. We supported an organization called the Russian-American
                    Press Institute. It wasn't called that in the beginning, though. It was located
                    in the Institute for the Study of the USA and Canada. My predecessor, John
                    Katzka, had given them about $5,000 bucks or so to set up a library. Then we
                    gave them a small grant to build on that.. Then we got funding to bring in a
                    professional-in-residence, as we called it, someone who is a professional media
                    person, journalist, to work there in that American Press Institute and organize
                    activities. Among the activities were cataloguing cases where journalists were
                    interfered with, arrested, or anything like that; following press legislation -
                    so sort of a watchdog function would be part of it. And they did seminars for
                    the press. For example, we went to Nizhniy Novgorod, a very reform-minded city
                    in the early days, for a 2-day seminar. The editor of the Moscow News went up. A
                    correspondent for the New York Times, Serge Schmemann, a great correspondent,
                    Russian-speaking, went up. I went up, the professional-in-residence, Lisa
                    Schellinberger from the Russian-American Press Institute went up. We addressed a
                    number of issues relating to freedom of the press and financial independence.
                    Then later, the Press Institute established affiliates in other cities and
                    organized these same types of activities in other parts of Russia.</p>
                <p>Something I forgot to mention in Hungary, which also applies to Russia, is the
                    IMF, not the International Monetary Fund, but the International Media Fund,
                    which was funded out of the Freedom of Support Act and SEED. In Budapest, they
                    established a journalism center and donated a journalism library. That was very
                    important. In Russia, the IMF would bring in highly qualified experts to conduct
                    seminars. Rather than our having to do it from our end in USIS, again because
                    our hands were so few, the Russian-American Press Institute would make the
                    arrangements. We would work with the Institute on the concept. The IMF would get
                    this great group of people. They'd come in, join up with some Russian experts,
                    and do the seminar for Russian invitees. They did some of that also in Hungary,
                    and they were great, very responsive. Marvin Stone was the director of that
                    operation.</p>
                <p>On one occasion, in Hungary... if I can just skip back to show how responsive the
                    IMF was. ... We'd had the first VOA, Voice of America, affiliate in East Central
                    Europe. At one point this radio station wanted to break the agreement with us,
                    claiming there was no way it could be profitable. Gene Mader, the VP or Deputy
                    Director of the IMF, flew to Budapest on a couple days' notice. He brought a
                    superstar on management of radios. With him. We sat down with them, worked out a
                    programming schedule on what would make sense economically, etc., etc., and it
                    all worked out. But that's the type of responsiveness we could count on. Again
                    multipliers. That's one of the ways we dealt with the press.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>We also gave small grants to media, to buy a modem, upgrade a computer,
                    paInternet service charges. There were internships for journalists in American
                    media outlets (Jim Denton at Freedom Forum did an excellent job on that), and a
                    lot of International Visitor programs. For example we'd take editors of several
                    papers and they'd go to the United States as IVs. Not only would they have
                    conversations with their professional counterparts, see how the press was run in
                    the United States, but they'd establish links among themselves, even though they
                    were in different regions of Russia and links with Americans. Again, sort of a
                    small part of...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about, particularly Western Europe, how did you
                        cooperate and work with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: There was a separate office in the Embassy to do that. and AID was in
                    there, of course, after a while in a big way. There was a need to do just that.
                    To keep track of what was going on Ambassador Pickering established an
                    assistance unit in the embassy with four people in it. There was a computer
                    program to collect and aggregate by category and region, and other dimensions,
                    all the assistance being given by the G7 countries. On a day-to-day level,
                    frankly, we cooperated in an ad hoc way, with others. For example, if the
                    regional Regional English Language Officer was going to do a three-seminar for
                    teachers of English in the Volga region, he would work with the British Council
                    to do that, rather than compete with the British Council. They shared the load.
                    But the idea of going out and trying to coordinate activities in advance, when
                    there are different funding lines, and when resources come online at different
                    times... different imperatives from host governments was more than we could even
                    consider. So we didn't really do it, frankly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, what about... thinking in particular the French and
                        the Germans... The Germans had always had sort of a entree there despite the
                        unpleasantness of two world wars, but Germany is part of that area in a way.
                        What were they doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: They had Volga there, they had Volga Germans there too. Gosh, what were
                    the Germans doing?... I know they were all doing things, but for the life of me
                    when you ask me that question now and I try to remember back...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how about the French?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: [laughter] Same thing. I can barely remember what we did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm just thinking that both the Germans and the French...
                        in a way, so much of this, I imagine, was done in either Russian or in
                        English, and that would put them somewhat outside this...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: They had the TACIS program (Technical Assistance to the Commonwealth of
                    Independent States, I believe), which the EU did in addition to what the
                    individual member states did. They were doing things in business development and
                    they were doing things in public administration. They certainly had exchange
                    programs. They certainly brought people to Europe on visits, and we cooperated
                    later on NATO, but by then I wasn't there. You would discover the impact of
                    other countries programs in your travels. We set up reading rooms, and sometimes
                    you'd go around and you'd find out that there was a German room, for example in
                    the Linguistics University in Nizhniy Novgorod, and they'd show it to you. At
                    the Library oForeign Literature, in Moscow, run by a very dynamic, firm believer
                    in democracy, Yekaterina Genieva, my predecessor had worked with the library to
                    set up an American reading room. Later that was expanded to be an American
                    Center... a really nice place with American books, several reference librarians,
                    electronic access, meeting rooms. Then, using that pattern, Mrs. Genieva also
                    developed a French center, a German center, a Japanese center, and an Italian
                    center. So those things were going on, and we did influence one another.
                    Resources were available to do things like that. The French tended to do more
                    cultural activities than we did. Their cultural budget was larger than ours. But
                    to give you a comprehensive overview of what the strategy of other countries
                    was, I really don't have a clue at this point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the attitude within Russia at this time? Were you
                        finding a whole younger class or older groups of people who were all of a
                        sudden able to blossom forth? Were you impressed by this, or notice...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: I was very impressed by this. When you entered a room full of alumni of
                    this FLEX high-school exchange program, who had spent a year in the United
                    States - and you know, I'd do that when I'd travel around... It was like
                    plugging into this gigantic battery. You just got this inflow of juice and
                    energy from them, and it was clear that these kids were terrific and that
                    something good was going to happen to them. In the area of entrepreneurship, we
                    had a program called “Business for Russia,” later called “Community
                    Connections.” The idea was you'd identify small business people. Here the
                    philosophy again was “Let's stay clear of the big policy decisions.” We know
                    that entrepreneurship is permitted; we know that in the United States small
                    business provides most of the jobs. We know it's going to be important in
                    Russia, too. God knows there are niches in the service industry all over Russia.
                    That was one of the big problems. So we know there are going to be small
                    businesses. Let's try to have a program where you identify good people in small
                    business. They go to the United States; they work in a business analogous to
                    their own, they live in an American community with an American family. Then
                    after 5 or 6 weeks, they go back to Russia and they take what they want, discard
                    what they want. They may see bad lessons, they may see good lessons. They'll
                    learn something about it and they'll be practical. We started this off on an
                    experimental basis, adjusted it, etc., and basically it came down to not
                    advertising nationally all at once because it was too complicated. And we wanted
                    to establish ties between a city in Russia and a city in the United States, so
                    that over a 3-year period, you might have several delegations going back and
                    forth. Ultimately, Americans would then travel to follow up. These visits by
                    Americans were unanticipated, but they happened. So we'd take, say, ten oblasts,
                    ten regions at a time. We'd advertise; we'd get applications. We'd screen them
                    and then we'd have interview panels that would talk to them. Select them...And
                    they'd go to the United States. These entrepreneurs were not young but, to
                    return to your question, they also blossomed forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These would be mixed panels, Americans and Russians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes. Mixed panels, Americans and Russians. And this was a surprise. We
                    were told, and I sort of thought this might be true too, all of us were
                    surprised. The conventional wisdom was, “Yes, when you're in Moscow, St.
                    Petersburg, the European part of Russia, maybe the Pacific coast, you will find
                    small business people who also speak English - because you had to speak English
                    for this program in order to imbibe by osmosis what was around you - but one you
                    get out past the Urals, you're not going to find people...” But it turned out
                    that there were people everywhere, and they had the most innovative ideas.
                    Somebody marketing scalpels by mail... they'd target people. They'd send them
                    one example of their product by mail, for free. And they'd say, “If you like
                    this, get back to us.” Marketing steel doors, because crime was a big, big
                    problem. All kinds of people came out of the woodwork, so there was ample work
                    for the binational panels.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>So, yes, I was very heartened and surprised, by how widespread interest and
                    ability were in Russia. The program for young professionals, called The Muskie
                    Program, identified young people in law, young lawyers, people starting out in
                    business after having a degree, journalists for graduate study at American
                    universities. They were super and the American universities gave us great
                    reports on them. So people were able to “blossom forth” in different ways. If
                    you think about alumni of USIA exchange programs in Russia, it's like a pyramid,
                    and it's all geared toward finding those people that we just mentioned, the
                    people who are going to come out of the woodwork and be the new generation in
                    Russia. At the bottom of the pyramid you'd have the high school kids, then you'd
                    have high school teachers, then you'd have college students, then you'd have
                    graduate students, then you'd have young professionals, then you'd have
                    professors, and then at the apex of the pyramid if you like you'd have senior
                    scholars and regional leaders and directors in different sectors of Russian
                    society. The layers of the pyramid were interlocking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you having the problem that I was told existed in
                        some places, it certainly did in Africa and all, that colleges and
                        universities in the United States were sort of professional grant type
                        things that took... whatever you want. This how they supported their grad
                        students, not necessarily to the welfare of the country to which they were
                        sent... these were often sent to African countries and mostly aid things.
                        But I was wondering whether this crept in, of people coming, and they knew
                        how to write grant proposals, but essentially the contribution was to do
                        surveys or something that would serve the universities and not the people to
                        whom they were serving.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Right. There were a couple of problems that these countries faced when
                    they were democratizing rapidly. They'd get all kinds of people coming in, not
                    just universities... think tanks, private organizations... they would portray
                    themselves as having resources, and just wanting to consult on how to use those
                    resources best. In fact, what they were doing was getting material for grant
                    applications which they were going to launch from a zero base of experience, and
                    try to get money and go where the action was. The organizations in Hungary or
                    Russia would spend a lot of time with these people because they'd think they
                    were funded, but they were really just there on spec.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>As far as the other points you mentioned - just coming and not wanting to do too
                    much - we didn't have... Our programs weren't really set up so much that way. We
                    had speakers who would come in, but they would be identified by USIA. We would
                    have groups from NGOs that would come in and be linked with local NGOs, but they
                    tended to be okay because the grant proposals would be run by the post first. So
                    you would screen a pile of proposals. You'd see an organization listed and you'd
                    think, “Boy, I'm surprised if anybody's contacted them.” And you'd ask, and
                    you'd find, “Oh, yes, somebody said... somebody signed the letter, but we don't
                    know what it's all about.” Or the message from the American partner might be:
                    “Don't you worry your head about this. Just sign here and we'll take care of the
                    rest.” There were quite a few pro forma agreements, so you really wanted to see
                    some sign of prior contact between these two organizations that were going to
                    have a partnership before you really gave it your blessing. I think, relatively
                    speaking, we didn't suffer too much from that, mainly because most of it was
                    competitive and individually based, and most grant money for institutional work
                    went to the American partners, which were used to auditing requirements.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And were you sort of keyed to watch for this, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes. Several things in the Hungarian experience I took with me to
                    Russia and that was one of them, for sure.</p>

                <p>McCARTHY: You are absolutely right. You had a vacuum where once there was
                    centralized power. Nothing is there, and you have democratic forces rushing in.
                    You have crime rushing in too. Extortion, shakedowns, carving up cities into
                    regions, payoffs, kickbacks. We would have experienced way more of that in our
                    programs if we had been giving grants directly to Russian institutions. But
                    mainly, we either had most of our money within these individualized grants or
                    working with these partnership organizations where our contribution was in kind,
                    like books or computers or Internet access. Or, it was a grant given to the
                    American partner, like an American university to work with a Russian university.
                    So the temptations that direct grant money might have been posed to the Russian
                    side weren't usually there just because of the types of programs we had. But the
                    potential was everywhere. It influenced what we did. For example, when we sent
                    our computer equipment to Yekaterinburg to set up the information resource
                    center, it was on a truck together with other computer equipment, and there were
                    armed guards on the truck. This was a shipment that somebody else was sending,
                    one of the businesses, for their purposes. We piggybacked on and helped defray
                    the cost, but it was an armed guard on a truck full of computers because it was
                    valuable property and could be ripped off. And that was something you'd never
                    think of in many locations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No. What was your impression of how things were developing
                        there? Were you aware of how the United States developed? Was this part of
                        your training, your experience of American history...was it sort of a replay
                        or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: I didn't think of it as a complete replay, just because of the
                    intellectual sign posts that guided leadership in the United States - the basic
                    readings they'd done, the models they were selecting, they were steeped in
                    thaMontesquieu, Locke, etc. Whereas, Russia hadn't participated in some of the
                    same historical movements, e.g. the Renaissance, the Enlightenment... well the
                    Enlightenment they did to some extent, the Protestant Reformation, developments
                    like that. In the Soviet period the society was intentionally sealed off, so a
                    lot of information didn't get out to a lot of people. Certainly, in some areas I
                    did see parallels - the wide-open western frontier. People would ask
                    expatriates, “Why did you come here?” “Oh, man, everything's open here. If
                    you've got a good idea and you can figure out how to get there before other
                    people, this is a great opportunity.” And the robber baron analogy that you
                    mentioned earlier also applies. But I looked at Russian developments more as
                    groping toward a new system that you can't really see, with resistance at the
                    top all the way as you're trying to go forward, and a population that wants to
                    get there, but there are some hard, big, bitter pills they have to swallow at
                    the same time. Inflation was something like 2,500% when I first arrived.
                    People's savings were wiped out. They'd played by the rules, and suddenly one
                    day everybody... all the rules are changed. People on pension were really
                    hurting. So my image of it was of fits and starts, going forward as worth it in
                    the end, but a lot of pain along the way because you're changing everything and
                    you're not ready for it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously, you weren't working the political circuit, but
                        what were you getting from your Russian counterparts about first Gorbachev
                        and then Yeltsin? And I want to stop here and move- (end of tape)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Though I didn't have the political beat, I had contacts with the
                    political class. We would send them on International Visitor programs. I would
                    have governors, mayors, and people like that over to my house before they went
                    to the United States. We would have seminars on federalism and similar topics,
                    where we would meet with regional governors and the local leadership, though not
                    with the main purpose of reporting. Gorbachev, he had no support. The people who
                    wanted reform thought he didn't go fast enough, far enough, that he held too
                    long to the idea of reforming Communism. The Communists thought that he sold the
                    system down the river. He changed the economic system, he changed the control by
                    the party. He gave away Eastern Europe, and he destroyed the Soviet Union. So,
                    he was without support... no, no support. That's what happens to leaders.</p>
                <p>Yeltsin, I think, opinions of... some people despised Yeltsin and some supported
                    him. Generally, the people that I had most contact with, I think, either looked
                    at him as some sort of great democratic force, saved Russia, saved reform during
                    the coup, courageous. Then, as he began to be more quixotic, I think a lot of
                    people sort of had this sense that, “We don't want the Communists to come back.
                    Yes, there are a lot of decrees, there are a lot of arbitrary decision, and
                    we're not talking about Thomas Jefferson. But he's dealing in a system where
                    this has to be done. He's our best realistic hope for the time being.” Something
                    like that, I would say would be pretty common.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you running across a problem, in all that things you
                        were doing, that there wasn't a strong judicial legal framework?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes. That was terrible for business people. You're in a joint venture,
                    the joint venture would be going well, and then you would be displaced... There
                    was at least one high-profile murder. This affected human rights also. The
                    judiciary was poorly paid. No real tradition of an independent judiciary.
                    Everything stacked toward the prosecution. But how did it affect what we were
                    doing? We did support law as one of the fields in our exchange program. We did
                    bring in people to lecture on that. There were experimental jury trials in
                    several of the regions, but that was something that we didn't take on with a
                    major commitment of resources. I believe there was a pretty big USAID project in
                    that area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself acting as mother hen or something?
                        You had what were these ten other former Soviet states, the 'Stans' and
                        other places. And they were being put together kind of on the cheap. Which
                        struck me always as a very poor decision. But anyway, how did you...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: Very true. And the same thing was happening in USIA. Our offices in the
                    USSR successor states were put together kind of out of our hide, so to speak,
                    without new money. I tended to know most of the people who were out there in the
                    'Stans,' and sometimes the expectations of what we could do for them from Moscow
                    were beyond what we really could do, e.g. translate books for them and ship them
                    out. We would try to do things for them. If we had a seminar, for example, on
                    running an information resource center, we would want their people to
                    participate. If we had seminars for staff in student advising centers, we would
                    want their people to come in. Of course, there was also some sensitivity about
                    coming back to Moscow, and you had to factor that in. You know, “I thought we
                    were independent states. Why should we always come back to Moscow for training?”
                    Gradually, they sort of weaned themselves away. But initially I think there were
                    unmet expectations. They thought that we were much better supplied. Here's
                    somebody who's chopping wood to get heat down there in Armenia. How can that
                    person not think that I, with central heating, etc. could do so much, if I just
                    got off my duff and did it? Not that he said that, but it's jus[laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter] Yes. What about the officers you were getting
                        out, people on your staff? How did you find them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Great. In general, in the Moscow mission, people either really wanted
                    to be there or really didn't. For the USIA people, again, the rewards are
                    tremendous. You run this exchange program. You see these people before they go.
                    You see them when they come back. You have an enrichment program for alumni. You
                    arrange a seminar and you go out and you participate in it. Everybody was
                    getting feedback and reinforcement all the time. Without good junior officers,
                    we could not have done half what we did. David Kennedy, for example, really made
                    those information resource centers happen. On the information side, you dealt
                    with dozens of radio and TV stations spread across 11 time zones. They would
                    send somebody through Moscow to make a couple of calls. We were on the circuit
                    and loaded them up with videotapes. They'd go back to their stations, and those
                    videotapes would go on the air. Audiences all around Russian would be exposed to
                    information about the United States, about democracy, about market economics.
                    Carol Lynn McCurdy did a great job on that. We provided dishes for major
                    stations to bring down WordNet programming. So, in general, I can't think of
                    anybody on our staff who wasn't really positive about being there. That didn't
                    mean there weren't frustrations sometimes. It didn't mean that they weren't
                    under a lot of pressure. They were. And the workload for some was crushing.
                    However, we had the great luxury of being able to hire all our FSNs from
                    scratch. Just go out and hire them. And they were fabulous.</p>

                <p>McCARTHY: No. That was the old system, exactly. No, this was the new Russia. That
                    was one of the great advantages. We got wonderful people. People with highly
                    advanced degrees, intelligent people who spoke English.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in many ways, you were duplicating what had happened
                        that I am familiar with that happened in Western Europe, right after the
                        war. Working for the Americans was a big deal. We were getting nieces of
                        prime ministers, and we lived off the fat, that luxury, for three or four
                        decades. It went finally. We were no longer the employer of choice. But at
                        one point we just got wonderful people. I guess you were beginning
                        to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, not so much that high connection, but more here's someone who's
                    been an English language teacher but always wanted to do something for building
                    up her country. Some people had minor connections, but I'd say it was more

                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: 1995.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you think? Whither Russia when you left?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: I was pretty positive. It all depends on what your frame of reference.
                    If you look at Russia and you think about what the United States is, you think,
                    gosh, there are so many things that are not right. But if you think about
                    Russia, as I remember it in the Brezhnev era, when I left, where everything was
                    just stultified, there was no hope of progress. That was just a dead end. That
                    was just flat-lined. They might continue to have military power, but they
                    weren't going to create wealth. You know, that's one of the big problems with
                    Communism. Once you go through the redistribution of the wealth that has
                    accumulated pre-communism, then what? There is a one-time mobilization when
                    everybody's on board, the new “in” group is suddenly upwardly mobile. After
                    they're there, nothing's going on in those societies. So compared to that, to
                    say nothing of compared to Stalinism with the gulags, millions of people in the
                    gulags, forced collectivization, etc., the change is significant. Where they are
                    now compared to their past is remarkable. The Russian people have a great
                    capacity to surprise. It is remarkable that people in St. Petersburg went in and
                    defeated a handpicked candidate under late communism... There was only one
                    candidate on the ballot, and all you needed was 50% to win, and enough people
                    crossed out the name that the person didn't win. It's so heartening to see that.
                    And seeing these young people, the raw mental and spiritual talent that's in
                    this society, gave me hope. Still does. Still does give me hope.</p>

                </p>

                <p>Today is April 10th, 2003. Bob, you had one job in Washington and you move into
                    another job in Washington, or had you come back? I can't remember.</p>
                <p>McCARTHY: I just came back from Russia. I left out a step, actually, for the
                    '95-'96 academic year, I was a diplomat-in-residence at Georgetown
                    University.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's talk a little bit about that, '95-'96. How did
                        you find Georgetown at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: I liked it. Georgetown has the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy.
                    It's a small outfit, relaxed, scholarly, full of practitioners. You had
                    associates from the Air Force, Army, CIA, foreign governments. So it was
                    interesting. And quite frankly, I really wanted some time to reflect after those
                    seven years in Hungary and Russia. I think that 3 of the 4 years in Hungary and
                    2 of the 3 years in Russia I probably worked as hard as I ever have, or could,
                    to the limit of my capability.</p>
                <p>So, anyway, it was a very good experience to participate in the intellectual life
                    of the university. I ran a colloquium - papers circulated and discussed, once a
                    week. You go and visit different classes, give presentations, brown bag, work
                    with students on projects and papers, research, and you have time for your
                    own... What I wanted to do was write a book while I was there. It didn't come
                    out that way, but that was my problem.</p>

                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Not drastically. I think it's more a question of texture, really. I
                    don't think there was a drastic difference.</p>

                <p>McCARTHY: That was our entire focus. What do you do about it. Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Particularly at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were forging new pathways.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the academic world getting good information? Were they
                        traveling a lot to Russia? Were they coming back with pretty current
                        knowledge they could put to use?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, I thought so. I thought they were current. Plus, Georgetown and
                    that Institute had very good relationships with government. Many government
                    officials spent brief periods there, when they would have workshops or seminars
                    or colloquia. There would be participation by individuals with real
                    on-the-ground experience. People likAmbassador Oakley, Ambassador Crocker...
                    people of that level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, in '96, you went back to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: In '96, I became the Director of the Office of East European and NIS
                    Programs in USIA, and that's the office that has charge of the posts in Eastern
                    Europe and the newly independent states, including personnel. We divided
                    ourselves up somewhat differently from the State Department at that time, so
                    Eastern Europe and the NIS were together rather than separate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did that from '96 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: From '96 to '99.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we go to what you were doing, how did you find the
                        information agency when you went there? I mean, clouds were hovering
                        overhead. It was going to be melded into the State Department and all. How
                        did this.. what was your initial perception of what this meant and how was
                        it working out while you were dealing with it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: Well, the clouds got darker, if you want to put it that way, or the
                    clouds got more voluminous as time went on. The merger actually happened in '99.
                    I think there was a lot of concern that we would be misunderstood or would not
                    have time to convince the new host organization, the State Department, of what
                    our particular comparative advantage was. Because there was so much work to be
                    done, and everybody was working so hard, I think the fear was that we would
                    pressed into service in traditional State Department ways, before our
                    capabilities were really appreciated and utilized. The corporate cultures are
                    different, and whenever a smaller organization merges with a larger
                    organization, the larger organization's corporate culture is dominant. That's
                    normal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things that concerns me... I was out of the
                        business, but... that the so- called, the new thing was called public
                        diplomacy, might be used to act as a... to justify present policy rather
                        than to cultivate long-term ties with exchange programs and things of this
                        nature. Did you see this as a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: I think that was on people's minds, although I think public diplomacy
                    always does both. It explains and advocates current policy, and that's our job,
                    particularly on the information side of the house. And in addition, it takes
                    that long-term view, and I know that was a concern because the corporate
                    cultures are different in several ways. One is that there so many issues that
                    are coming to a boil in the Department every day - talking points that have to
                    be prepared, briefing papers, reports, etc., that have to be done. There's a
                    focus on this week, and what happens this week. And it's legitimate. There is a
                    need to get ready. The focus of exchange programs is very long-term. You
                    sometimes don't see benefits for twenty years. But they're there, and if you
                    want to reap the benefits twenty years from now, you have to plant the seeds
                    now. So, yes, there was definitely that concern.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, let's turn to... Who was the head of the agency
                        while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Joseph Duffy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've had mixed reviews from people I talked to about him.
                        How did you find him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: I think he was an academic by disposition. What we really needed at
                    that time was somebody who really understood what USIA could do, who could
                    explain our capabilities in terms of the national interest, and who could give
                    examples of the value we brought to the table. And I don't think he was suited
                    for that at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've heard people say that he often questioned the
                        validity of USIA.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: I never heard him do that, but...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, but this is people, sort of when he was musing, people
                        who were close to him...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it wasn't a happy fit I take it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: It certainly wasn't a happy fit in the beginning. I think there is a
                    great irony here. When USIA was brought into the department, we were basically
                    not understood in any depth. We were looked at as an organization that has
                    exchange programs and does press work. How hard could it be, really? And as
                    people got to know more about us, because we were more physically present, I
                    think our capabilities were more appreciated. Events in the outside world have
                    validated the proposition that just because the cold war ends, the need to talk
                    about the U.S., tell America's story to the world, and forge partnerships that
                    go beyond governments is not lessened. It's in fact intensified if anything. At
                    the same time that we have greater appreciation, and even respect perhaps, the
                    ability of USIA or public diplomacy to function as one integrated whole had been
                    reduced, simply because of the way we were divided up when we came into the
                    Department. That doesn't mean public diplomacy can't work this way. All of that
                    is possible, but the desk officers, I think, many of them, in public diplomacy
                    units in the regional bureaus are not as attached to their public diplomacy
                    colleagues in the field as they were. There was a great synergy there, I
                    thought, in the United States Information Agency, and a lot of credence was
                    given to the field perspective. In general, all things being equal, you took the
                    analysis of the Public Affairs Officer in the field as your starting point and
                    tried to deliver the goods. The Department, on the other hand, has a tendency to
                    try to direct things from Washington. Once you are at the Department table, you,
                    as a major player in public diplomacy, need to have a story to tell there too.
                    Our story was that public diplomacy is organized more horizontally, with a
                    flatter structure. Situations were constantly changing on the ground overseas -
                    perceptions, images. We needed to be subtle; we needed to take our cues from
                    officers on the ground who understood how to convey our message in terms of the
                    local culture. That is not a very compelling story at the “grown-ups'
                    table.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I always felt thought that the information officer, that
                        whole USIA function, abroad was greatly appreciated. There was great
                        interaction because we're all doing the same thing and the perspective often
                        was extremely good, it was very necessary, because we are all working in the
                        field. But when you get back to Washington, it gets caught up in Washington
                        politics and hoping that you don't want to be the messenger of bad
                        news...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's go out there and do that, make the Arabs love us, and
                        that's what you're supposed to do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Right. The intentions were all good, and the model that most people
                    spoke of was the country team model, trying to replicate in Washington what
                    happens at the country team level. But it's just hard to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your responsibilities, '96 to '99. What were you
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: From '96 to '99 there were several issues that were important in our
                    part of the world. There was the transition from communism to democracy and
                    market economics. Of the two dozen countries that I had, probably 18 or 19 of
                    them had come into existence during the previous five years, after the
                    disintegration of the USSR and Yugoslavia. They were all previously communist
                    countries, so this was almost a universal theme across the entire geographic
                    area. Then there were the new security arrangements in that part of the world,
                    with the collapse of the Soviet Union, disintegration of the Warsaw Pact, the
                    new role for NATO, and particularly NATO enlargement. There was an immense
                    public diplomacy dimension to that.</p>
                <p>Then you had the issues in the Balkans, starting with Bosnia and the Dayton
                    Accords, and 20,000 U.S. troops as part of that 60,000 force sent to Bosnia to
                    oversee compliance. Then there was Serbia and its activities, Kosovo, the
                    relationship to Albania. That constellation of former Yugoslav states was a
                    major preoccupation.</p>
                <p>And then, cutting across all of those issues was the management challenge. We
                    were downsizing at that point because of budget restrictions. We were cutting
                    positions everywhere. In our case - eastern Europe and the former USSR - we were
                    being downsized before we had ever been upsized. Those were new posts, which had
                    been created out of our own hide. They were understaffed. They had extraordinary
                    responsibilities placed on them and great expectations, so you had to figure out
                    a way to get the job done out there without enough people to do it, and still
                    make decisions where you were going to cut staff and other budget items.</p>
                <p>I think those were the major issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You would think, that this would, at the time of this, it
                        sounds awful, but it sounds like a wonderful time to be a fairly junior
                        officer getting out there, getting all sorts of responsibility in Kyrgyzstan
                        or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: And it was. Officers who went out there, almost without exception,
                    there were a few exceptions, returned saying this is the greatest assignment
                    they'd ever had. Even if they didn't welcome the assignment initially, they had
                    enormous responsibility and the resources to make a difference. The whole
                    society, in almost every case, was making an historic transition. What they
                    could provide the countries wanted. So they have interlocutors there and they
                    are getting resources because of these large, separately funded programs, the
                    Freedom of Support Act and the Support for East European Democracy Act. By the
                    time I left the area, we were getting over $100M in Freedom of Support Act
                    funding for exchanges every year. and maybe another $15-20M for SEED. That's
                    $120M basically for exchanges The worldwide exchanges budget of the Bureau of
                    Educational and Cultural Affairs was about $230M. In other words, the special
                    funding for the NIS/eastern Europe programs was equal to more than half of ECA's
                    funding for exchanges with the entire world. So it's an enormous amount. And the
                    officers out there were the ones who got to make the deliveries, while their
                    colleagues in other parts of the world were starving for resources.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, when you look at what happened, you have that
                        whole area you had particularly at that time... I'm for familiar with
                        Kyrgyzstan, which seemed to be almost the forefront of moving ahead, but
                        then you've got countries like the Ukraine, which really should be a beacon
                        for everyone seeming to settle into the 1930 model or something like that.
                        Were you separating? Were you saying 'we can do something there; we can't do
                        something there'? How were you working that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: Exactly that. In some countries, you would have support and you could
                    do a lot of things in tandem with the host government; in some countries, the
                    host government was anti-reform and you were basically working on a separate
                    agenda. The most dramatic case of that would be Belarus where Lukachenko wanted
                    to turn back the clock. He made it very difficult for us to function. He ejected
                    the Soros Foundation from the country, for instance, and did various other
                    things. We decided we would work with NGOs and we would support independent
                    media, to the great dissatisfaction of Lukachenko, but that was where we could
                    make a difference. At some point, those people would come to power. It happened
                    everywhere else, so we knew it would ultimately happen there. In other cases, in
                    Poland, for example, or in Hungary, you could work closely with the government,
                    see where they were going and fit in with their agenda so their agenda and our
                    agenda sort of reinforce one another, and we got more bang for the buck. But
                    even in a place like Kyrgyzstan, which is way out and beyond, we had wonderful
                    possibilities. We had a key Fulbrighter in education who extended two or three
                    times because it was so important. We helped establish the American University
                    of Kyrgyzstan (with FSA funds). That university exemplified merit-based
                    competition, no bribes or payments for marks... taking the best and the
                    brightest. The Soros Foundation provided scholarships to students who couldn't
                    afford the tuition. So, no matter where you were, really, you got tremendous
                    gratification. You really did the Lord's work and advanced U.S. national
                    interests and simultaneously advanced the interests of the people in those
                    countries. At times our actions were consistent with host government policy, and
                    at times they did not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about the Soros Foundation. Could you explain
                        who Mr. Soros was, what he was doing, and how we looked upon it. Was it a
                        mixed blessing, or how did it work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Well, Mr. Soros is an �migr� from Hungary, an investment banker, who
                    wanted to do the right thing with a good portion of his money. He had everything
                    that he wanted, he said. So he began to promote open societies. In fact
                    eventually, the Soros Foundation offices became known as the Open Society
                    Institute. I remember when I first encountered them in 1988, in Hungary. I went
                    to a provincial city... not provincial in the sense of parochial, but a
                    non-capital city, Szeged, where the peppers grow. I went into a student club,
                    and we were talking about what they are doing and what we might do in exchange
                    programs, etc. I see these TV monitors hanging from the ceiling. I ask, “What do
                    you use those for?” They explained that they have video shows and they bring
                    students in and they have various programs on aspects of democracy, pluralism,
                    etc. I asked, “Where'd you get them?” “Soros Foundation. They came down here and
                    thought we were doing good things and they gave them to us.” You go to a library
                    and they run a photocopy for you, which is unusual because all copying machines
                    were closely controlled in the communist era. And I'd say, “That's great, you've
                    got a photocopier.” “Soros Foundation gave it to us.” So they had done all kinds
                    of things to promote openness.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>I always thought the Foundation was a good thing. Naturally, if you control all
                    the resources yourself as one person, you can make changes whenever you want.
                    Turn on a dime if you want. That might be a little disconcerting for partners,
                    if something the partners want to support is no longer going to be supported.
                    But, on balance, I thought it was great. We had a partnership with them in
                    Hungary and jointly established half a dozen student advising centers that
                    worked out very, very well. Several are still functioning. The Soros Foundation
                    still runs a portion of the Muskie exchange program for young professionals in
                    the NIS. They also have programs to sort of promote post-exchange activity by
                    participants in the not-for-profit area so that they can afford to apply some of
                    the lessons they learned.</p>
                <p>They're very good at recognizing needs. For example, libraries had a shortage of
                    hard currency, which made it difficult for libraries to purchase foreign
                    journals. In addition previously normal ties were cut off between the former
                    states of the Soviet Union and Russia, so the libraries weren't getting academic
                    journals in Russian either. There was greatly reduced access to information.
                    Libraries couldn't afford to pay the price for these things. So, the Soros
                    Foundation stepped in and paid for subscriptions via a wholesaler.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Historic note here... We just spent 15 minutes stopping
                        the interview, going to the top floor of this two-story cottage we're doing
                        the interview in. We're on the State Department grounds, the Foreign Service
                        Institute grounds. A simulation of a nerve gas attack and we have survived
                        it and we have now resumed questioning. [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was anybody every questioning Soros? It sounds like
                        everything was... I can't think of money better spent.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: It was very well spent. He put fiber optics into some cities. He
                    provided all those magazines to all those universities. He did performing arts
                    things and funded the drafting of new textbooks. It seems to me there might have
                    been problems with an individual or an individual office on occasion, but I
                    can't remember anything major. People might, I can't remember chapter and verse,
                    feel that the Foundation would start on a project in partnership and then decide
                    that priorities lay elsewhere. If the partner is a government, it takes longer
                    to make those changes. But I can't think of an example off the top of my
                    head.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But basically, this is a very plus thing.McCARTHY: Very
                        plus, oh, sure.</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any other programs going that particularly
                        impacted on your area that you got involved in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: In Bosnia, for example, after we had the Dayton Peace Accords in
                    December of 1995, we put a TDY person in there right away. One of the things he
                    wanted to do was promote the media in the new Bosnian state, because it was
                    composed of three entities, and we wanted to promote reconciliation and
                    cooperation. You had a Croat part, a Bosnian (Bosniak actually) part, and a
                    Serbian part. You wanted to get reliable information out and have it reach
                    publics in all three parts of Bosnia. So we established the Open Broadcast
                    Network. That involved sending in equipment via U.S. military transport with TDY
                    VOA engineers and a TDY USIA FSO to deal with the stations and other players to
                    install the equipment. That was in partnership with the EU. Their money came in
                    later than ours because of their budget process, but it was a partnership. For
                    much of the time by the way, our TDY FSO used an outdoor plastic picnic table as
                    his office.</p>
                <p>We had a civics program in Bosnia, which was very important, because you had
                    these kids who had been in basements for four years during the war there, with
                    Serbs against Bosnians. After the peace, they came out and were going to resume
                    school. One of the key things of interest to them and their parents and their
                    teachers was how to live in a society where people get along.</p>
                <p>So civics was very real to them, not at all academic. The Center for Civic
                    Education in California, under a grant by USIA... and here I will say by the way
                    that the Deputy Director of USIA was, very informed and very committed and
                    really made a difference in making this civic education program a success. We
                    worked together with the Council of Europe, so that would be another partnership
                    program. Everybody was on board. The approach was to take American curriculum
                    material and use it, translating and adapting it slightly. This sounds a little
                    a patronizing, U.S.-centric plan, but it was the only way to go forward because
                    those three entities could not agree on a common set of values or a common
                    history which they could draw upon to create their own materials for all of
                    Bosnia. They could, however, agree to use third-party materials from a country
                    they all recognized as a democracy.</p>
                <p>So this program brought in teachers and curriculum developers. U.S. and European
                    teachers came in, 30 at a time, and would go out and do workshops for Bosnian
                    teachers. Eventually, this curriculum spread throughout much of the school
                    system. You even had Republika Serbska, the Serbian republic, participating.
                    Their school children came together with school children from the Croatian part
                    and Bosnian part and presented their civics projects. Part of the program was to
                    present a project, say recommended draft legislation, for example. They'd have a
                    day or two of these presentations. They'd be televised.</p>
                <p>We initiated civics education programs in many countries. Unlike the Bosnian
                    initiative, however, they were focused on developing indigenous materials.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find... you know, our approach to education is
                        different than the French approach to education and the British approach. We
                        all have our own approaches. These things are highly ingrained in the
                        culture. Was it difficult to get teachers from different elements or
                        programs to do this sort of thing without running afoul of each other?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: On the civics program, the Council of Europe teachers tended to
                    emphasize human rights issues more than we did. We tended to emphasize civil
                    society issues more... how governance is established, how people participate in
                    government. On most of these education projects, the need was so great and the
                    interest was so high that people weren't really worrying about the philosophical
                    basis behind something. If they wanted to include journalism in Bosnia and we
                    had a program to link three schools of journalism in the three entities with an
                    American university (as we, in fact, did), they were interested. I should say
                    that the idea of student participation, class involvement in presenting and
                    defending ideas, was greatly appreciated, whatever the particular project. It
                    ran counter to the notion of teacher on the pedestal, but teachers - especially
                    younger teachers - welcomed the approach.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you are entering this period of the Internet and fast
                        communications...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: First place, was this a little hard to get used to...
                        because it's almost as if you could have instantaneous direction from
                        Washington into the field, which of course the field resents. But also how
                        to plug other societies into this. How did this work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Well, on the first part, communication with Washington was great,
                    because you could send an e-mail at the close of business your day, and come in
                    the next morning and the answer would be there, because they were working while
                    you slept, and vice versa. So that was great. In terms of how you reach out to
                    the rest of society, there were two foci of what we did. One was using the new
                    information technology to get our own information out, like the Washington File
                    (the old Wireless File) with transcripts, testimony, briefings, etc. We sent the
                    File out from Washington by computer directly to the computers of media outlets:
                    television stations, radios, newspapers...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about foreign ones.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: Foreign, foreign. Yes. The File goes out when ready, so the editors
                    would arrive in the morning and they'd have the File on their, in their
                    computers. We also had a fax-on-demand service at many posts, where people who
                    didn't have Internet connections would dial a number and have material faxed to
                    them. Some of our posts had an archive service, so you could put in a term like
                    NATO, Kazakhstan, missiles. And you could find any material on that.</p>
                <p>But in addition to that, getting our own materials out, we wanted to try to make
                    up for lost time and help these countries connect with the outside world again.
                    That relates particularly to the NIS. We developed a very good program, the
                    Internet Access and Training Program (IATP). Through this program, we set up
                    Internet sites around all of the NIS. You would go into an institution and ask
                    to go into partnership with them. They would make available space. You would
                    provide computers. The NGO grantee would provide a trainer there for a year, and
                    that individual would train a successor. The sites provided Internet access to
                    people who could come in and go online for serious purposes. You would invite in
                    people from important disciplines and professions and run seminars on how to use
                    the Internet for professional purposes - to research a news story, run an NGO,
                    improve the environment, get legal information, etc. We had dozens of sites.</p>
                <p>One level up from that, were information resource centers. And every embassy...
                    and the USIA was really out in front on this stuff, I have to say. We were
                    really out in front. We had information resource centers attached to embassies.
                    In there you'd have good Internet connectivity with a fast line. You'd have paid
                    subscription services to databases. You would have hundreds and hundreds of
                    journals available there in the center, for example through the ProQuest system,
                    on CDs. And you'd have a reference librarian who could answer questions. In many
                    of these countries, parliamentarians would ask us for information on U.S. laws
                    when considering legislation. So you had several stages. You had the embassy
                    getting information out; you had information resource centers providing
                    information in a very targeted way, and you had these indigenous access points
                    to stimulate access by the society.Project Harmony, which ran the Internet
                    Access and TraininProgram in several countries organized competitions to put up
                    local sites in local languages, in Russian or Uzbek or whatever on a particular
                    subject, say some aspect of ecology. There would be a 6-month competition. And
                    people would do wonderful things: categorizing flora and fauna; surveying
                    pollution in rivers. And the next time it would be a competition on teaching
                    methodologies, 6-months. And again, for almost no money, they'd put up this site
                    and they'd get a cash award of say $5,000 to do more with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Were we pushing the acquisition of computers with
                        Internet capabilities all over?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes. We were pushing that and we would donate them in some
                    instances.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the problems, in the United States it's not too
                        bad, but in some of the European, in fact in England and other places, it's
                        been a problem... the local telephone systems were pretty slow in responding
                        and they wanted to charge all outdoors and made this whole thing very slow.
                        Did you have a problem with that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: It depended on the country and it depended on the region in the
                    country. That was certainly a problem in many areas. It was always necessary to
                    advise our colleagues, when putting something up on the Web, to always have a
                    text-only version. When you have these neat graphics, people cannot download
                    them. Also to advise people don't send unsolicited e-mails with big attachments.
                    It takes too long and people pay for that. It has to be something they want. So
                    there's a communication discipline involved in that too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any other efforts you were working on? Were you
                        working all the time in the agency?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: During the three years?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: The NATO enlargement issue was extremely important, and again, every
                    country had its own approach, and we supported it from Washington. But the
                    elements of our support generally included some version the following: you send
                    key decision makers from parliamentary committees or journalists who follow
                    security issues to the United States on the International Visitor Program. The
                    information resource centers would package up materials specifically for the
                    decisionmakers. The PAOs would be working to get the word out. They'd be using
                    speakers who'd be coming in. Any visit by, say, the Chairman of the Joint
                    Chiefs, Congressmen, relevant administration officials would involve a public
                    appearance to answer questions.</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>In some cases, this was completely in sync with what the government was doing.
                    For example, in Hungary, we provided material to Hungarian Radio that had a NATO
                    Day, and they had one hour in the life of servicemen in Fort Riley. They had
                    archival material. They had interviews on open phone lines with people back in
                    Washington who were handling NATO affairs, “What is the Congressional
                    perspective?” “What is the military perspective?” “What does it mean, that
                    interoperability?” “What are the budget implications?” Because Hungary was going
                    to have a referendum, the post there went all out to make sure the word got out.
                    They had the Taszar U.S. air base at that time in southern Hungary, which was
                    the staging ground for troops going into Bosnia, and later on they had Kosovo
                    air strikes coming out of there. But the post used that base as a way to
                    familiarize journalists, parliamentarians, and others with NATO in practice...
                    they would have tours. The PAO and IO would arrange tours of the Taszar base for
                    influential Hungarians and local leadership.</p>
                <p>In Slovakia, by contrast, the situation was completely the other way around. The
                    government wanted to portray NATO enlargement as a conspiracy against the
                    Slovaks not to let them join, and sort of tar the USG and NATO with that brush.
                    So there, In Czechoslovakia, the post devised a strategy to make sure that the
                    entrance criteria were well known, and it would be noted by all public speakers
                    that the Slovaks were not meeting these criteria. You can get in if you meet the
                    criteria and if you don't, you don't get ithat was the message. Poland and the
                    Czech Republic were more along the lines of Hungary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just for somebody to understand... This was the beginning
                        of the enlargement of NATO. It was the American policy to encourage
                        NATO.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, that's right. And three countries, Hungary, Poland, and the Czech
                    Republic came in in 1999. There was the big summit in Madrid and invitations
                    were tendered and by the end of the year they came in.</p>
                <p>Oh, alert PAOs in those three countries noted that on the accession date, nothing
                    in particular was planned with those countries to acknowledge it. So they did a
                    joint cable pointing this out. Secretary Albright then, who was at a ceremony in
                    the United States recognizing the enlargement, also did a WordNet with those
                    countries, which was broadcast on national television, and the broadcast was
                    coordinated with displays in the public squares, balloons going up, and
                    everything. So that broadcast really sort of solidified that relationship.
                    Otherwise it would have been a misstep, a missed opportunity in terms of public
                    diplomacy. It was also an example of Washington responding rapidly to a proposal
                    from field officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the WordNet? Again, this was way in ad- (end of
                        tape)</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>Bob, you might explain what the WordNet was, and how it had developed by the time
                    you were doing it.McCARTHY: WordNet was a worldwide television system involving
                    transmission and production facilities in Washington, DC, in USIA, and reception
                    facilities on most embassies around the world. There would be a dish there on
                    the embassy someplace so they could take in a signal. There would be reception
                    dishes at key media outlets abroad that would be donated by the U.S. government.
                    That enabled those television stations to do interactive interviews with policy
                    makers in the United States on very short notice, and enabled us to put out all
                    kinds of material that could be downloaded by these television stations and also
                    be downloaded by USIA colleagues in embassies overseas. Those officers could
                    tape programs and use them for seminars or send material out to someone who was
                    particularly interested. It was real-time connectivity via television.</p>
                <p>An example. And it's relevant to this particular time... When Milosevic in Serbia
                    was cracking down on the media, we had a WordNet studio in our Belgrade embassy.
                    That embassy would do an interactive interview with, let's say, an assistant
                    secretary of state or somebody at the National Security Council. They would
                    invite in representatives of journals and television stations, radio stations.
                    They would hear the WordNet and then ask questions. They would be on mic asking
                    questions. Everything would be translated into Serbian and recorded on video and
                    audio cassettes. Then, as the journalists left, they'd be given a cassette of
                    that broadcast. They would then go back to their own cities, and at that time
                    the municipalities were in the hands of the opposition, they'd go back to their
                    own cities and broadcast those programs. So, it would be a way of getting the
                    signal out. Getting the message out, I should say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I take it the WordNet really had embedded itself
                        into the system by this time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, but it wasn't everywhere. Again, in Bosnia, for example... too
                    complicated to explain the background... but there was a television station in
                    the Serbian Republic and an election coming up. We wanted to make sure that
                    prospective voters there understood our policy. So, we donated a dish to the
                    station, and then had all the key individuals in Washington concerned with
                    policy toward Bosnia go on the air in real time, for uncensored broadcasts to
                    the entire population. Senator Lugar was on, Ambassador Gelbard, Ambassador
                    Holbrook....all the big policy makers. That ensured that our message, again, got
                    out, not skewed, not interpreted for the gain of any one political party. So the
                    idea was embedded, but the system wasn't up and functioning everywhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, is there anything else we should cover during this
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: I think there are a couple of things that I thought we did particularly
                    well. We talked about large exchange programs that promoted reform. We also did
                    a good job providing TDY personnel to staff important operations, concentrating
                    personnel where they were needed most at critical times. At peak times in
                    Bosnia, we sometimes had a dozen people in there. We had a constant roster of
                    people going to Sarajevo for three months or so. We also, on the management
                    side, had what we called a SWAT team. Foreign service nationals from a post or
                    two, a professional trainer from USIA, and a regional programming officer from
                    our regional office in Vienna went to a particular post. The post would close
                    down for two days or so and they'd do team building and focus on mission goals,
                    communication, and other issues, and eighty percent of the time they'd leave
                    that post better off than they found it.</p>
                <p>Let's go back to Kyrgyzstan again. The PAO who hosted the SWAT Team in Kyrgyzstan
                    noted tremendous differences after that team left. Her local staff were doing
                    things like calling the military attach� to get together and talk about issues.
                    An FSN would have been reluctant to do that before the seminar. Several people
                    got drivers' licenses who hadn't had them before. And then some of their
                    spouses, some of the women, got drivers' licenses, which was unusual. So there
                    were repercussions both in personal life and in increasing the efficiency of the
                    post.</p>
                <p>That also reminds me of how well our Regional Programming Office (RPO) in Vienna
                    functioned. RPO was a real lifeline for those incredibly stressed posts. RPO
                    assessed computer needs, ordered equipment, helped install it, and trained
                    staff. They arranged exhibits and displays in all the local languages, taking a
                    project from the concept stage through delivery of the physical product. We held
                    a variety of training sessions at RPO. When a presidential visit was scheduled,
                    RPO prepared signage and printed multiple copies of the ready reference booklet
                    for accompanying press, drafted by the USIS post. RPO in every way was a best
                    practice.</p>
                <p>Let me just mention a couple of other things we did that I thought really drew on
                    the comparative advantage of USIA and wouldn't have happened if we hadn't been
                    there. During the Kosovo crisis, at one juncture there were negotiations at
                    Rambouillet, France to reach a settlement. Participating were the Serbs,
                    different parties from Kosovo, and a contact group of nations sponsoring the
                    conference. At the end, there was a draft agreement and we wanted both the
                    Kosovars and the Serbs to sign off on it. A week had gone by, neither party had
                    signed off. The Kosovars wanted to familiarize public opinion with the contents
                    of the agreement, but there was a real problem. You have this semi-occupied
                    tense area in Kosovo with lots of restrictions in place, including media
                    limitations. You want to get the word out on what the contents of this agreement
                    are, so people can understand it and say yea or nay. How do you do that?</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>Our PAO in Tirana, Albania, proposed that Albanian television in Tirana receive a
                    daily broadcast from Washington, bounce it off a satellite to Albanian speakers
                    in Albania, includinand this is the important part - Albanian speakers in Kosovo
                    in the broadcast footprint. So, every day, in the Washington studios here, a
                    policy maker would examine a different section of the draft agreement, discuss
                    it, and then take questions from the audience. And people would call in from the
                    studio in Tirana, and journalists would call in from homes in Kosovo and ask
                    questions. As a result, night after night, a large swath of the population in
                    Kosovo became familiar with the provisions of this draft agreement. We know it
                    was effective because our Macedonia PAO, Phil Reeker, who was with Ambassador
                    Hill, who was charged with negotiating this agreement, was up in the mountains
                    of Kosovo with Kosovo Liberation Army folks. There was a lull, and he asked
                    whether anybody had heard the broadcasts. They all said they'd heard the
                    broadcasts and then offered him tips on how to improve them. So, we know it was
                    getting through. Kosovo did approve Rambouillet; Serbia did not. And then the
                    bombing started. That's something that I don't think anybody else could have
                    done, to get back to your WordNet question. Another example, while we are on the
                    subject. When NATO troops seized the transmitters in the Serbian Republic,
                    because they were broadcasting hate messages...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the Serbian part of Bosnia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes, exactly. The Serbian station went off the air, was taken off the
                    air. Suddenly, Banja Luka, the major city there, their television station became
                    the hub of all broadcasting. There were Assembly elections coming up, and there
                    was tremendous fear that television screens would go dark, because Banja Luka
                    was not prepared to handle a full TV schedule. They wouldn't have any
                    programming... no sports, sitcoms.... People would associate the lack of
                    programming with NATO, with taking the other programs off the air and it would
                    affect the reformers negatively in the election. So, based on that, USIA got a
                    van full of broadcast tapes driven down from Belgrade, TDYers went out with
                    packs of tapes from Washington, WordNet broadcasts to Sarajevo were taped and
                    transported up to Banja Luka, a Slovenia TV station loaned tapes. I think it was
                    a station associated with Mark Palmer, if I remember. All this stuff came in
                    quickly and filled the void. Again, it's a small thing people don't think about
                    until it happens, but somebody had to get there and keep that station on the air
                    because they couldn't just be broadcasting news and alienate everybody who
                    counted on television for entertainment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '99, what happened for you?McCARTHY: In '99, I moved to
                        the Office of Policy and Evaluation in the Bureau of Education and Cultural
                        Affairs.</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This had to be quite an interesting time, sort of
                        professionally. What you were doing there, because you were in this
                        difficult transition into the State Department, how did it play out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: It was, and one of the things we wanted to make sure we did was explain
                    USIA and explain public diplomacy assets any opportunity we got. The annual
                    planning cycle presented one opportunity. Every bureau had its Bureau
                    Performance Plan, which it presented to the senior leadership in the Department,
                    the Secretary if she were available, or the Deputy, or, as in our case,
                    Ambassador Pickering. Our office was in charge of putting together the
                    PowerPoint for that. We combined a description of what we do, what our
                    capabilities were, proof that what we do works, and our plan for the future in a
                    crisp, 30-minute PowerPoint. It was very well received.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Explain what PowerPoint is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: PowerPoint is a computer-generated system of slides that go up on a
                    screen, like a small movie, and it's accompanied by sound, if you want it to be.
                    Assistant Secretary Bader read the script that went along with it and took the
                    questions at the end. And there are other instances of trying to understand what
                    the perceptions of people at State were, and our perceptions, and trying to
                    blend them.</p>
                <p>In any case it was important to know whether our programs actually worked. One of
                    the big questions is “You have these exchange programs, so what? What does it
                    mean, and how do you know they work?” So we had large survey research projects
                    on exchange programs. We probably have two dozen completed by now... and they
                    really, for the most part, validate the assumptions of the programs.</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>For example, we did a survey of senior Fulbright scholars from the United States
                    over a 25-year period. It was a web-based survey if they wanted, or paper and
                    pencil if they wanted. More than 80% wanted web-based, which gets back to your
                    point again, of the Internet's being integrated into everything. The results
                    were fascinating. Among the findings, 75% of these scholars still collaborate
                    with overseas partners. Seventy percent initiated exchange programs on their
                    own. Virtually all of them incorporated their Fulbright experience into their
                    teaching, into their lecturing, into their writing. Many had written books, etc.
                    Almost all had given presentations to public groups in their host countries and
                    back in the U.S. So the point is that a Fulbright award is far more than an
                    enriching academic experience for an individual. There is a multiplier effect -
                    a force multiplier, as the military would say. Individual scholars magnify and
                    amplify the experience when they come back. And there are many other examples of
                    effectiveness. The Business for Russia Program for Entrepreneurs, for instance.
                    When we surveyed them, they marketed their products better, they innovated more,
                    their profits went up, they hired more people, they had a wider market for their
                    products. I could go on and on, but it's on our Web page. These evaluations made
                    a significant contribution to meeting the demands of OMB, the Office of
                    Management and Budget, while also satisfying ourselves that the programs
                    work.</p>
                <p>One thing that I'm particularly proud of... Our office had responsibility for all
                    the programs in the NIS in Eastern Europe, that is coordinating... I should
                    say... for coordinating the budgets. And we began to realize that we needed to
                    focus on alumni activities in a more systematic way. A lot of activity had been
                    done by different offices in the Bureau of Education and Cultural Affairs on
                    this, but they were not coordinated. We hired an alumni coordinator and we put
                    up a Web site. One of the big problems, when you have hundreds of thousands of
                    alumni, is knowing who they are and where they are. And trying to play catch up
                    is a very time-consuming undertaking. At the same time, you have new alumni
                    coming online every day. We know all these alumni want a way to communicate with
                    each other and want a way to communicate with the United States so that their
                    exchange experience isn't one shot, it's an ongoing thing. So we put up a
                    website that was interactive and that encouraged alumni to use the site for
                    their own purposes and to communicate with one another. We built in enough
                    incentives that they would want to use it and that they would come back. So we
                    started that in April of 2001, with a few participants, and there are now are
                    well over 4,000. Alumni can go on line and find people who went to the same
                    university, find people who are in the same town, find people who are in the
                    same field. They post job openings and it's now the case the alumni, senior
                    alumni, are hiring new alumni. There's a whole section on grants and one on
                    professional development. There are related links. There's a whole network of
                    interesting, important information for them. We can go on there and see who is
                    doing what. They have the capacity to make their experience more relevant
                    because they can get resources. Eventually, this will grow and grow and it will
                    become worldwide. Assistant Secretary Bill Bader made this a priority and tasked
                    our office with making it happen.</p>

                        talking about God, it must be getting close to 50 years or so...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Yes</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Have been a tremendous success. Basically, we've got
                        something to pass on to people. The American experience is essentially an
                        international experience anyway. We've always been an absorptive society.
                        People who come here usually don't feel on the outside.McCARTHY: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They are readily accepted. It's sort of unheralded work
                        that's been going on for yea these many years, that's had tremendous payoff
                        for us.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: That's true, and when something like 9-ll happened, ECA initiated
                    special International Visitor programs for individuals from countries with large
                    Islamic populations: Morocco, Egypt, Syria even, Indonesia. There must have been
                    a dozen countries. And they came here and we did a special evaluation of those
                    programs. They definitely learned more about the United States. They felt that
                    Americans wanted to learn about them. They felt they had the chance to tell
                    Americans about themselves. The appreciation of volunteerism and pluralism was
                    very high. In short their view of the U.S., after direct exposure, was anything
                    but the stereotype one sees reflected in the Pew public opinion surveys So, when
                    a particular issue comes up, these exchange programs can be tailored quite
                    precisely. And direct personal exposure to the American experience you mentioned
                    is critical.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you look back on your career, how did you feel whither
                        the public diplomacy field? Where is it going?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>McCARTHY: I think it's an open question. I think there is, as I mentioned
                    earlier, a lot of appreciation for it. FSI, the Foreign Service Institute, is
                    now instituting normal training for public diplomacy officers, under Pat
                    McArdle's expert guidance, just the way a consular officer or admin officer has
                    training. Initially we got three weeks of training to cover everything. That
                    reflected the “How hard can it be?” view. I'm afraid that the career prospects
                    won't be very great for somebody in public diplomacy. So, people will go in for
                    a few years and then move out. Some of the esprit and corporate memory will die
                    out. I hope that we don't, five to ten years from now, declare a victory and
                    say, “Everybody is a public diplomatist now, so we really don't need a public
                    diplomacy cone any more.” Public diplomacy sections in missions are no longer
                    linked tightly to public diplomacy colleagues in Washington. The levers linking
                    the parts have been detached. And the administrative burden, stemming from
                    integration, I understand, is still substantial and distracting. The budget
                    could be vulnerable. It's an open question. Public diplomacy is not yet
                    established as an effective component of State's activities. But it's not the
                    case that public diplomacy is in the garbage can.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What are you doing now? You're retired, I take it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: I'm retired, and, with a colleague, Mark Jacobs, I'm developing a new
                    course for Cultural Affairs Officers for the Foreign Service Institute... It's a
                    great job, trying to introduce practical exercises and create situations where
                    CAOs have to deal with real life problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Have you had much contact with student here?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Not yet. No. No sense cluttering my mind with the end-users.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter] Say in cultural affairs, how about the new
                        technology? Is this making a difference?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: I think everybody uses technology now to communicate quickly. At the
                    same time, the old technology is also beneficial. For example, after 9/11, we
                    sent an exhibit of photographs from Ground Zero in New York City around the
                    world. It's been to probably 75-80 countries by now. And this is the old
                    fashioned model - mounted pictures with text and accompanying speakers. At the
                    same time, you can go online and look at that same exhibit from anywhere in the
                    world, if you have Internet access. I think it's just a component of everything
                    one does now. It's not isolated out as “Now what do we do in technology?” It's
                    more this is the objective, this is how we want to do it, and we'll incorporate
                    technology into our approach.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It raises a question... When USIA came into existence, the
                        big rule was that it was not going to propagandize the United States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Right.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: [laughter] That's true. That's very true. We don't disseminate the

                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: It hasn't turned into a problem. I think when you look at the
                    multiplicity of sources of information, the threat has probably been reduced
                    from what it might have been when ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think there was a feel that this could become a sort of

                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Exactly. As you know, we couldn't distribute our products in the U.S.,
                    except for Problems of Communism, which was a scholarly journal, and English
                    Teaching Forum, which is a magazine for English teachers. There was special
                    congressional approval for “Years of Lightning, Days of Drums,” and a few other
                    special efforts like that.</p>

                        in it, the Iraq War... this is in April, 2003. There's been a great deal of
                        hostility shown in the Muslim world against the United States. How have you
                        felt we've been able to respond to this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: As I understand the surveys, most of the objections are to policy
                    rather than to the United States or to Americans. We can articulate the policy,
                    we can explain the United States... it's a long-term proposition. I don't think
                    public diplomacy is particularly adept at taking a fact on the ground and making
                    it palatable to people who don't like it. I think public diplomacy's great
                    contribution is in establishing channels of communication, relationships of
                    trust, awareness of how the United States works, an appreciation of its values
                    and particular advantages, so that one is less likely to believe in stereotypes
                    and gross misrepresentations. They will be skeptical about outlandish charges.
                    That occurs as the result of years of attentive, adequately financed work in the
                    field. But I don't think there is any magic way to present a policy so that
                    suddenly you change public opinion.</p>

                </p>
                <p>McCARTHY: Okay, thanks very much.</p>
