                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is February 3, 1998. The interview is with J.D.
                        Bindenagel. This is being done on behalf of The Association for Diplomatic
                        Studies. I am Charles Stuart Kennedy. J.D. and I are old friends. We are
                        going to include your biographic sketch that you included at the beginning,
                        which is really quite full and it will be very useful. I have a couple of
                        questions to begin. While you were in high school, what was your interest in
                        foreign affairs per se? I know you were talking politics with Mr. Frank
                        Humphrey, Senator Hubert Humphrey's brother, at the Humphrey Drugstore in
                        Huron, South Dakota, and all that, but how about foreign affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: I grew up in Huron, South Dakota and foreign affairs in South Dakota
                    really focused on our home town politician Senator and Vice President Hubert H.
                    Humphrey. Frank, Hubert Humphrey's brother, was our connection to Washington,
                    DC, and the center of American politics. We followed Hubert's every move as
                    Senator and Vice President; he of course was very active in foreign policy, and
                    the issues that concerned South Dakota's farmers were important to us. Most of
                    farmers' interests were in their wheat sales, and when we discussed what was
                    happening with wheat you always had to talk about the Russians, who were buying
                    South Dakota wheat. We were greatly influenced by the views of leading
                    politicians like Humphrey and by South Dakota Senator George McGovern, whose
                    Food for Peace idea became a beacon for liberal policy of the Kennedy
                    Administration and helped South Dakotan farmers sell their wheat. These
                    politicians' politics may have been based on local interests in agriculture, but
                    those interests brought us high school kids closer to Russia and the Cold
                    War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Russia and wheat? Was Russia a purchaser or a
                        competitor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Russia was a purchaser and there was always the question whether
                    their harvests would not satisfy their needs or would provide the market for
                    South Dakota farmers. Each year market uncertainties would affect the price of
                    wheat worldwide. In addition, the US Government would determine whether to allow
                    the Soviets to purchase American wheat. This debate was our window on
                    international politics; U.S. relations with Russia were very much on our young
                    South Dakotan minds.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a high school student and even before you were busy
                        singing and in sort of various extracurricular activities. What did you
                        read? Any sort or types of books?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: One of the books that forcefully struck me early, was a book called
                    “Giants in the Earth” by O. E. Rolvaag, a Norwegian immigrant to the Dakota
                    Territory at the turn of the century. The book described life on the prairie,
                    its character and interaction with the elements, especially the weather. As you
                    will find when you talk to people from the prairie, or at least from South
                    Dakota, that the elements of nature play an incredibly important role not only
                    for the crops but also for our very survival. Rolvaag was a very important
                    novelist for me; he captured the characteristics necessary for survival in the
                    bleak, bleak prairiself -reliance, individualism and community. These values
                    were certainly our link to Jacksonian Democracy, a frontier culture where
                    government actively supports the well being of the communitits political,
                    economic and moral welfare. Also, I read other pure American literature of John
                    Steinbeck, Jack London and, Mark Twain. Those were the adventure and novels that
                    we read.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Willa Cather and something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: I should of course talk about “Small Town on the Prairie,” Willa
                    Cather from neighboring Nebraska was a favorite author. Not to forget Laura
                    Engels Wilder froDeSmet, South Dakota. Of course, both authors were part of the
                    genre that explained our lives to the world. By the way, DeSmet and our capital,
                    Pierre, were named for the Catholic missionary Pierre DeSmet from Belgium, who
                    helped bring education to the Indians and the settlers in the Dakota Territory
                    in the late 19th Century.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to say that you were coming out of the period
                        when there was a considerable literary focus on that particular element,
                        area of the country. Follow the literature of the '20s and '30s and '40s, of
                        course they are still being read. There was quite a school around the
                        prairies.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Indeed. And for us the literature was not only entertainment; books
                    helped us understand our daily life. It was our literature; we discussed it to
                    understand our connections with life and our outlook on the world. As you see in
                    the “Life on the Prairie” and the connection to politics, you find very much the
                    conflicts we faced, whether in the Cold War's conflicts or in the elemental
                    conflicts we faced eking out a living on the very harsh prairie. We were
                    children of pioneers on the prairie and our lives were described in the
                    literature. Our politics were shaped in the discussions that we had at the Huron
                    J.J. Newberry's store soda fountain with Hubert Humphrey's brother Frank, while
                    we drank cherry coke. Frank would tell us stories about his brother's political
                    exploits in Washington, and we listened in awe of the great man from our
                    hometown.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any particular ties to Scandinavian countries,
                        othethan some people were from Scandinavia? I was just wondering that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: For me there were very few ties for us to Scandinavia, other than the
                    bachelor Norwegian jokes. Our family had a strong personal history of our
                    arrival in Dakota Territory. My great-grandfather Carl, a Prussian Musketeer of
                    the Fifth Pomeranian Regiment emigrated from Prussia after the Battle of
                    Koeniggraetz in 1866. He came first to the Burr Oaks Farm in Ford County,
                    Illinois and then later homesteaded in Dakota Territory in the 1870s. Our life
                    eighty years later very much focused on our own frontier-like experiences
                    drawing from these settlers.</p>
                <p>In fact, my great-grandfather, Carl Bindenagel came to Spink County in Dakota
                    Territory shortly after Colonel Custer took his U.S. Seventh Calvary through the
                    Black Hills in 1874 and demonstrated that the U.S. Army would provide security
                    to the European immigrants who wanted to settle the land there.</p>
                <p>World War I became the breaking point for ethnic connection to Germany that
                    created a true “American” identity for German immigrants on the prairie. That
                    was particularly true for the German community, but also to European settlers.
                    Until the Great War, German ethnic identity was strong. My Grandmother, Elsie
                    Bindenagel, told me that after the first World War, a distinct American, not
                    German-American, identity was created among my kin in the Dakotas, and probably
                    also in the U.S. After that awful conflict, the old countries, Germany, Norway,
                    and Sweden began to lose their hold on the settlers' identity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about maps? Did maps play much of a role or not? My
                        generation is older and we had WWII as kids. We followed it on maps and we
                        really got to know maps.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: We didn't do much with maps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about when you came to college? Did your view of
                        foreigaffairs open up at all or was it still rather constrained?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: My views on foreign affairs were really affected by my personal
                    experience. I was in college in 1967; at that time my brother, Steven, was an in
                    the U.S. Army and stationed in Nha Trang, Vietnam. The focal point for us as we
                    approached age of 18 was the military draft. Vietnam and the draft gave us a
                    focus on foreign policy; it was very personal and shaped our views. The Cold War
                    was our reality; it meant to give your life for your country. It determined my
                    sense of public service, military service, national service. My sense of
                    obligation was strong; my father was in World War II, an infantry soldier who
                    fought in Europe in 1944-45. My brother was a crew chief mechanic on helicopters
                    in Vietnam. So, my focus, interest in foreign policy was very much driven by my
                    sense of obligation to serve the United States in the Vietnam War and the Cold
                    War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at this era, one begins looking at University of
                        Wisconsin, University of Minnesota, Columbia, University of California, all
                        that. What were some of the currents in your school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Of course there was a heated debate about the Vietnam War, and it was
                    politicized, serious, even life threatening. Nevertheless, there were light
                    moments. While Columbia University students in 1968 were rioting against the
                    Vietnam War and its campus was exploding, we at the University of South Dakota
                    in Vermillion were demonstrating, too. We were less politicized, but we had a
                    good social life, good camaraderie that was developed at USD. Still, we had a
                    different view of the world from our place on the prairie.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Foreign Service come across your horizon at
                        all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: No, neither as a high school student nor as a college student did
                    such an elite profession as diplomacy cross my horizon. Such a career was
                    seemingly beyond my possibilities. I went to the University of South Dakota to
                    major in a very practical professiobusiness. After my first year of studies, I
                    switched to political science, having been deeply influenced by a great man,
                    Professor Dr. William O. Farber, a wonderful mentor who inspired students to
                    stretch beyond the horizons of the prairie. In fact there were several of us at
                    the University that he mentored, people like Tom Brokaw of NBC, Phil Odeen of
                    BDM, Senator Tim Johnson and many others. Dr. Farber was a man who encouraged
                    personal and intellectual development and inspired young people toward great
                    achievement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Coming from this particular state in time, was there a
                        socialist bent towards what you were getting? I am talking about
                        cooperatives and things, broad socialism as opposed to doctrinal
                        socialism.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Politics in South Dakota were fascinating. As I said, the farmers
                    really dominated our interests. The farmers were very conservative, but at the
                    same time there was this prairie socialism that is very much a part of our
                    upbringing. If you look at our key industries, you would see that electricity,
                    an assumed service elsewhere in the U.S., was not in the Dakotas.
                    Electrification of very isolated farms was not economical and needed government
                    assistance to provide it. So a government program, called the REA, was created.
                    REA by the way is much better known as the “Railway Express Agency” but for us
                    it was actually the Rural Electrification Association. That is; the association
                    that brought electricity and subsidized those poor, isolated farmers whose lives
                    were greatly improved by electricity.</p>
                <p>We also had in South Dakota a problem with cement to build highways and other
                    infrastructure. So the State built a factory to supply cement so that we were
                    able to build highways and other projects. So there was an element of social
                    concern or prairie socialism, but at the same time we had a very deep
                    conservatism. South Dakota Senator Karl Mundt was, for instance, the father of
                    the Senate's committee on Un-American Activities. We had two senators during my
                    high school time, Senators George McGovern and Karl Mundt. While on the one hand
                    George McGovern, one of the fathers of the Food for Peace Program, was very much
                    a liberal progressive politician, Karl Mundt was a very conservative politician
                    on the other hand. Karl Mundt was one of the fathers of the Nixon-Mundt bills
                    that brought us the Walter-McCarran Act in a period of fear about the
                    communists. Both Senators captured the unique aspects of politics in South
                    Dakota.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You graduated in 1967 and went to the Army?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: No, I graduated from Huron High School in 1967 but went to University
                    of South Dakota at Vermillion for two years. In the summer of 1968, between my
                    freshman and sophomore years, I worked at the Chrysler Corporation Belvedere,
                    Illinois, assembly plant. I became a member of the United Autoworkers Union, the
                    UAW, and found myself working on the “body drop” where the overhead rail brought
                    the car bodies to the ground level line together with the car frame. It was not
                    a really exciting job, except one time when a co-worker switched jobs with me
                    and we fumbled the next car in line and stopped production for a minute or so.
                    That act must have cost the company my entire summer salary. In any case, I was
                    from Huron, Humphrey's hometown, and the Vice President was running for
                    president after Lyndon Johnson had dropped out of the race. Of course I spoke
                    glowingly of him and his policies, despite the George C. Wallace bumper stickers
                    and buttons worn by many of the workers. From my view these discussions were fun
                    and remained fun until the Chicago Democratic convention when the debate turned
                    ugly and violent. One morning as I was blithely dropping car bodies on frames
                    when the foreman came over to me and told me abruptly to shut up and keep quiet.
                    It did not take long to know why. Several other workers suddenly gathered around
                    me and stood with tools, chains and other potential weapons. They made some
                    provocative remarks and I continued to do my work as if they were not there.
                    After twenty minutes, their break time ended and they returned to their won
                    stations. The foremen came up to me and warned me never to speak about politics
                    again on the job. I learned a valuable lesson in free speech; it does not come
                    free. Intimidation may have worked in the short run to silence me on the job,
                    but it strengthened my determination to excel in college. In my sophomore year
                    at the University of South Dakota, I was told that I had become a resident of
                    Illinois because my parents had moved in to Illinois in 1966. Consequently, and
                    with the good advice of Professor Farber, I transferred to University of
                    Illinois in Urbana-Champaign in 1969.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were there what you were taking?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: At the University of Illinois I majored in political science, with a
                    minor, due in great part to the Vietnam war, in Asian studies. I took a course
                    in Chinese at South Dakota, and took courses necessary for an interdisciplinary
                    degree at Illinois.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find the atmosphere at the University of Illinois
                        aUrbana different than in South Dakota?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Yes, by then in 1969 the demonstrations at the University of Illinois
                    against our involvement in Vietnam were much more serious; we were headed to
                    confrontation with the police already in 1969. In the fall of 1969 we had the
                    lottery that decided our draft numbers. I can still remember sitting around our
                    house at 301 South Busey Avenue in Urbana, where I was living in with many other
                    students. We all watched the television and as the numbers were being pulled;
                    some of us were absolutely crushed by a low number and others elated by a high
                    number that they got.</p>
                <p>My draft number was 190, which was ambiguous, but actually my Rockford, Illinois,
                    draft board (where my parents lived) did draft to number 190. I was ambivalent
                    about what I would do. The demonstrations at the University of Illinois became
                    polarized and heated. There was a professor, Mike Parenti, at the University of
                    Illinois who wrote a book called “Anti-Communist Impulse.” He was in the
                    Political Science Department where I was a student; he had some friends around,
                    among other political science professors who were deeply opposed to the Vietnam
                    War. In the fall, Parenti and others organized demonstrations and a campaign to
                    protest the Vietnam War. It culminated in the spring of 1970, as we saw what was
                    happening at the Kent State, where the National Guard shot and killed four
                    protesting students. At the University of Illinois the National Guard were also
                    called to bring order on our campus. The State Police came often. One serious
                    demonstration in May 1970, we had several thousand demonstrators on campus, the
                    State Police came in formation and broke up the picket line that had been set up
                    around one of the buildings and blocked garbage trucks from picking up the
                    garbage. Police used that picket line as a reason to attack the demonstrators
                    and in fact beat up Mr. Parenti who was later then charged and convicted of
                    attacking a policeman. You had a very tense period from 1968 bombing, and the
                    Cambodia bombing in 1970 at Christmas. For me facing induction into the army,
                    the debate was existential, as it was very intense debate among the
                    students.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you coming out on this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: I was personally very torn. I had been a cadet in the Reserve Officer
                    Training Corps at the University of South Dakota, a mandatory program that had
                    grown out of the Land Grant Legislation of Abraham Lincoln that required militia
                    training at land grant colleges. The University of Illinois was also a Land
                    Grant College, but had abolished the mandatory part of ROTC. After I received my
                    draft number of 190, I decided to stay in the Reserve Officer Training Corps, so
                    I was clearly on the side of those who chose to support the government even
                    though I was uncertain about our policy in Vietnam. It was a difficult time. As
                    I walked through campus in May 1970 among the armed National Guardsmen, who were
                    townsmen in uniform, I found it unreal. Here I was an ROTC cadet and these
                    guardsmen were standing on this campus blocking my way; it was chilling, having
                    just seen similar guards kill students in the spring of 1970 at Kent State. The
                    whole scene was very unnerving.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you explain what happened at Kent State?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: At Kent State there was an anti-Vietnam War demonstration and the
                    National Guard was called in to quell the protest. As they moved against the
                    demonstrators to break them up, shots were fired. Four students were killed.
                    This created at Illinois a very tense relationship between the National Guard on
                    campus and students, and the situation deteriorated significantly that spring
                    and into the fall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel the administration handled it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: The students also attacked our university administration when we saw
                    other university Chancellors being blocked in their offices. The Chancellor at
                    the University of Illinois, Jack Pelteson, was also held hostage in his office.
                    I thought he handled it fairly well. He never became the focal point. He did
                    have his office cleared by the police or the Guard at one time; however, he did
                    engage with the students. However, by using the Police and National Guard on
                    campus the focus was on the abuses of power implied by the call of Police
                    brutality.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You graduated in 1971, with a major in political science?
                        Anlanguages?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: I had Chinese from South Dakota, only one year, anFrench. And from
                    high school I had German.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then what happened? You were in ROTC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: ROTC. In June 1971, I was commissioned a Second Lieutenant US Army
                    Reserve and waited orders until November calling me to duty. During that period
                    I stayed at the University of Illinois and worked at the library, waiting until
                    I could go into active duty. I went into active duty in November, went to the
                    Infantry Officer Basic Corps at Fort Benning, Georgia. Then in January or so
                    went to the Military Intelligence School at Fort Huachuca, Arizona. In the
                    meantime, I married my college sweetheart, Jean Lundfelt, in December of
                    1971.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did she feel about the Vietnam war? She was from
                        where, thUniversity of Illinois?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: She attended the University of Illinois with me: she is from Downers
                    Grove, Illinois. We met when she was protesting the university's decision to
                    close the undergraduate library, which was threatened by Vietnam War protesters.
                    Perhaps I could best characterize the ambivalence of being in the military at
                    that time by saying that when we got married and we were going to Fort Benning,
                    Georgia, our wedding announcement said that we were living in Columbus, Georgia.
                    That was all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get into the intelligence side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Actually, I was a rather outstanding ROTC student, I was one of the
                    top students, and a so-called “distinguished military graduate.” There were some
                    reasons for that. One is, those people who were “distinguished military
                    graduates” were able to choose a branch of the Army other than Combat Arms. I
                    chose one of the support combat arms as a way of fulfilling my duty and
                    something that I thought was less likely to get me killed as an infantry
                    officer. Nevertheless, I was sent to the Infantry Officer Basic Corps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What type of intelligence were you trained to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: I was trained in counterintelligence and in tactical intelligence.
                    Counter-intelligence of course was policing the internal concerns of the Army
                    and tactical because I was attached to the infantry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you were sent to Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: “I was given an opportunity” as they say in the Army, to volunteer
                    for indefinite service, with a promise that I would go for one year to Germany.
                    This quite frankly would delay for a year my transfer to Vietnam, a difficult
                    place to go at that time. I chose the offer I could not refuse.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1972. At that time, we were beginning to pull out anyway.
                        I left Vietnam in 1970, the Embassy, and the so-called Vietnamization was a
                        real draw now.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Yes. The calculation for each of us depended on your military
                    occupation specialty, your MOS. For us in my occupation specialty, military
                    intelligence, we had a deficit until late 1973. At that point the drawdown had
                    come to point where they had more officers than they needed. At the beginning of
                    1974 we were told that there as an excess of lieutenants in the field and
                    several of us in W�rzburg decided that it would be right thing to do to curtail
                    our assignments. And on February 28 1974, I left military but stayed in Germany
                    with Jean. I worked a temporary job at German electric company for several
                    months. We also used that opportunity to travel around Europe to Sweden, Spain,
                    the Netherlands, France and Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to go back a little to your military time. You
                        already covered a lot of that in your paper, but what was the feeling in the
                        military where you were about the Soviet threat at that particular time,
                        1971-74?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: We were of two minds. One, you recall that the U.S. Government had
                    begun MBFR, Mutual Balanced Force Reduction, talks in Vienna. We saw that as an
                    effort to keep us Europe because the threat didn't seem to be very serious,
                    perhaps that was correct or not, I don't know. It wasn't evident to us that the
                    Soviets were actually threatening us. On the other hand what we saw in the fall
                    of 1973 was a different kind of threat, and it redefined the threat for us. We
                    were in military exercises in October of 1973 in the forests of Franconia,
                    Northern Bavaria. We watched very closely the reports about the war that had
                    broken out in Israel, the Yom Kippur war. As we were exercising to fight the
                    Soviets across the Central Front in Europe, we heard President Nixon's call for
                    defense condition three (DEFCON 3). By calling the defense condition three, we
                    were actually set on war alert which was a shock to us because we had focused
                    only on the Central Front in Europe, which didn't seem to be threatening us.
                    Suddenly we were being told we were on alert to deploy to the Middle East,
                    because the Soviets allegedly had sent troops to Syria to be used against
                    Israel. This alert was a significant shock to us. We came back into garrison,
                    divided into groups, checked our equipment, and began to recamouflage our trucks
                    and jeeps into sand camouflage. So it was a very short but significant period of
                    time when the threat changed for us, from one of the Central Front to a
                    worldwide threat. The implications of the Cold War breaking out anywhere, not
                    only in Vietnam, the European Central Front, and then in the Middle East became
                    very evident too. Particularly a friend of mine, Andrew Tourville, a lieutenant
                    with me at the time in W�rzburg, and I had a lot of discussions about what the
                    threat was and what did it mean, until the Yom Kippur war. It is strange now in
                    retrospect to see that we chose not to stay in the military, armed to the teeth
                    to fight and that instead I chose to go as a diplomat behind combat lines with
                    just my wits to engage with Cold War enemies against the United States. Andy and
                    I resigned from the military the same day.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There you were a lieutenant in the Army, and their real
                        concern particularly in Vietnam but also elsewhere, was about two things:
                        the fact that so much of the equipment had been sent off to Vietnam, and the
                        morale of the troops. Leary talks about the hand grenades being thrown at
                        the officers, and other things like this. It was still a drafted army. There
                        was a problem with drugs and all. Was this a difficult time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: It was a very difficult time. As I said I was trained for
                    counter-intelligence but I found most of my time dealing with social problems:
                    drugs, alcohol, and lack of discipline. Certainly the equipment we had was
                    simply dismal. Our own motor pool was a tent, this is Germany where winter is
                    serious, and we had a tent. We had no office in the motor pool, so the sergeant
                    found an old bus, which he personally converted into a little office. We had
                    severe morale and motivational problems among the troops, although my
                    intelligence detachment was actually less affected than the rest of the infantry
                    division. But it was a very demoralizing time. In fact, anecdotally, we had a
                    comment about going out on maneuvers against the Soviets. A very sad commentary
                    it was. We joked that we would just tell the infantry troops that in each of the
                    Soviet tanks that they would fighting there was a kilo of hashish, we felt that
                    that would be their motivation to fight. That's how bad, how difficult it was to
                    be in the Army in Europe at that time. We had a few soldiers back from Vietnam
                    that had a few months left before separation and they were very disruptive. They
                    had been in Vietnam and then they were sent here were we didn't have any real
                    equipment, we didn't have any real purpose. As I said, the threat wasn't as real
                    as it was in Vietnam so they had a very hard time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the attitude of the Germans that you were
                        meeting whilyou were in the Army towards our presence there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: There were several attitudes. We lived off base in a little town
                    called Rimpar, near W�rzburg, a village where the neighbors, such as Peter
                    Zuber, were very friendly to us. They invited us to wine tasting parties; they
                    took us on outings; they were very generous. They were usually younger people,
                    about our age and tried to integrate us in their lives and were very supportive.
                    On the other hand, there were several older people in the neighborhood who had
                    directly experienced World War II; they were concerned that our presence was
                    provocative and would provoke the Russians into attacking. They particularly
                    didn't like our (Hawk anti-aircraft) missiles and were very concerned. As a
                    result, when we encountered people in the very beautiful Residenz Gardens Park,
                    perfect strangers didn't hesitate in stopping us and telling us how provocative
                    our soldiers were. Such encounters were not unusual. The overall climate was
                    very, very good. However, individually they liked us very much and concerned
                    themselves with our well being. They, too, were very concerned about our morale
                    problems. And yet when we had annual German-American Volks festival, the
                    townspeople in W�rzburg would flock to the base to eat American ice cream and
                    play games.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you running into the German students? For some reason
                        I have the vision of German students taking protest much more seriously than
                        American students do. You know, painting themselves up, all sorts of things.
                        I mean, this is newsreel. Did you get any of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Yes, we did. Leighton barracks, where the Third Infantry Division
                    headquarters was located, is on a hill inside the city of W�rzburg. W�rzburg
                    itself is a university city. There were regular demonstrations against the
                    Vietnam War. What always struck me though, was that there weren't violent
                    demonstrations, it was the orderliness of the demonstrations. Approaching
                    Leighton Barracks up Rothendorfer Strasse through the residential area, the
                    green grass of the private lawn stretch in front of the Army housing area. Of
                    course in Germany there are unwritten rules that you don't walk on the grass.
                    And indeed, these demonstrators protesting the “murderer” American soldiers in
                    Vietnam were very orderly and kept off the grass. And would scream their slogans
                    and then dissipate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did our military react to this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Actually they were pretty calm. The gates were usually closed as we
                    saw the demonstrators come; the military stood inside and did not provoke the
                    student demonstrators. In the back of my mind was the Red Army Faction attack on
                    the Frankfurt officers' club that killed an American officer. The RAF was a
                    serious terrorist threat to Americans, especially the military. They also
                    kidnaped and attacked German Businessmen and officials. The demonstrators' chant
                    that sticks in my mind still is “Ami go home.” I was always struck with that,
                    “Ami” as American or French for friend; I could never tell.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When I was in Germany in 1953-58, that was the thing you
                        woulsee, “Army go home.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Chants like those were heard all the time. In fact, If you allow a
                    flash fast-forward to the time when I was assigned to Bonn years later, I went
                    into the History Museum in Bonn in the 1990s and heard the chant. The museum has
                    a video of the times, and as I was walking through for the first time I heard
                    this echoing sound “Ami go home, Ami go home.” It was a familiar chant that
                    immediately drew my curiosity. I went over to video that showed a leading German
                    leftist, Rudi Dutschke, and some other demonstrators protesting American
                    presence, who was killed by police. I was getting flashback 25 years later of my
                    own life there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a counterintelligence officer, were there attempts by
                        Germans,East or West, to disrupt things or do things, was this a

                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: No. We really didn't have any counter intelligence cases that took us
                    into the realm of intrigue. We had a division military intelligence unit that
                    was another battalion that did this as well. Perhaps they did, I didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a good idea of your Soviet counterparts on
                        the otheside of the border?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: We had no personal idea and certainly no contact. We had only movies
                    and propaganda that the military showed us. The image we had was very nebulous,
                    but respecting them as a worthy enemy. Although, I must say, if you allow
                    another flash-forward to October 1989, when I was living with my family in East
                    Germany. We went to Mulhausen, home of Thomas M�nster, the East German's ideal
                    revolutionary from the Peasant's War (Bauernkrieg) of the 1500s. As we were
                    driving our little Volkswagen Jetta out of Mulhausen to Eisenach, near Meinigen,
                    which is across from our Army sector of the Fulda Gap, I came upon a 30KM speed
                    limit sign on a cobblestone road. I muttered to myself, saying, “Here we go
                    again, another lousy East German road,” but to my surprise I suddenly found
                    myself smack in the middle of a Soviet tank maneuver. There were six or eight
                    tanks, huge things, all their tubes pointing West to where I had been stationed
                    in the army and they were moving very fast maneuvering over the road and down
                    the tank trails. The entire fearful Soviet soldier images that I had suddenly
                    appeared in this real-life roar of Soviet tanks preparing to invade West
                    Germany. I must say I became very uncomfortable about this confirmation of my
                    own perception of the Red Army soldier, the enemy from 1972 was still very vivid
                    in my mind. Here is was 1989 and they were still quite capable of moving into
                    the direction of where I had served as aArmy officer, nearly twenty years
                    earlier. We drove quickly through and got out of there knowing that tangling
                    with a big Soviet tank would have minced my little car and its passengers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You got out in '74 and you spent little time traveling
                        around.Was it Germany or all over?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: My wife Jean and I moved across all Western Europe. We went to Italy,
                    Spain, Netherlands, France, Sweden, and Norway. Had a very nice time camping,
                    visiting friends the Tourvilles whose own travels with an infant introduced us
                    to new adventures. For six months we lived in Germany and made trips. In Sweden
                    we visited a high school exchange student, Stephen Spinnell, who had become a
                    doctor in Umea. He took us to experience the midsummer's night festival and to
                    hike above the tree line in Kvikkjokk, where even the feared mosquitoes could
                    not go. It was a carefree time of pure pleasure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you thinking about going to work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Very little. Actually at that time I went as an auditor (Gasth�rer)
                    in a course at the University of W�rzburg, with the idea that I would stay
                    there. GI bill benefits were possible to use at a German University as well so I
                    had this idea that I would attend the university. My German was not at a level
                    where I could be admitted immediately so I spent this first semester, between
                    traveling, auditing classes. I learned that a four-year course of studies at a
                    German university simply would not work for us. We came back in August of 1974
                    and I went back to the University of Illinois to get a Master's Degree in Public
                    Administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you looking at? You went to get a Master's in
                        publiadministration in 1974. What did that point you towards?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: I had this conflict whether I would be in public service or business.
                    Obviously that was resolved when I decided to seek a degree in public
                    administration; I still wanted to work for the government. By that time I had
                    also had foreign experience, I had learned some German, and I had an orientation
                    about the role of use of force and the role of military. I did not want to be in
                    the military, but I wanted to do something that would be live up to the Humphrey
                    image of public service. In fact I had seen the Foreign Service exam advertised
                    while I was in the field after the 1973 Yom Kippur war, and decided that I would
                    like, among other things, to try to take the Foreign Service exam, which I did
                    that fall.</p>

                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Vaguely. We went into this exam with its three-person panel. I recall
                    Elaine Shunter and Ms. Ostrander were two members of the panel. We went through
                    a series of situational open-ended questions. “What would you do if?” “If you
                    were sent to some place and you wanted to a establish a new consulate, and you
                    were on your own, what would you do first, second, third? How would you deal
                    with it?” With various scenarios thrown in, we had a good back and forth. There
                    were a lot of questions about the U.S. I remember something about “What book
                    would you recommend someone who wanted to see the U.S.?” I also remember my
                    answer which was John Steinbeck's “Travels with Charlie” which was always struck
                    me as a great guide to see the U.S., take six months with man's best friend a
                    dog and have a great time. They asked about Sweden, some of the places I have
                    been in Germany. It was very intense, how long it lasted I don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: About an hour. I used to give the exam in '75.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: I remember Schunter and Ostrander well. The funniest thing was after
                    the exam, they excused me from the room, deliberated, and then called me back in
                    to say, “We have decided to recommend you for further consideration.” And I
                    looked at them and said, “What does that mean.” They replied, “You passed.” I
                    admittedly was anxious for their answer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Jean feel about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Very good in the first instance. At the University of Illinois she
                    had a job with a heart surgeon, and we had very good social life, however, we
                    knew that we had to get on with life. Suddenly, in June I was asked to come in
                    immediately to join the new Foreign Service class. I accepted, and we were
                    uprooted. It was an adventure. That decision unleashed a very serious discussion
                    with Jean over what to do with her career. She was in anthropology at the U of
                    I, graduated with high honors, she had a full fellowship to graduate school and
                    gave that up when we went to the Army. So the discussion we came back to the
                    kind of life do you want to have. At that time Foreign Service made it very hard
                    for two careers. We faced a very crucial decision because it was virtually
                    impossible for Jean to pursue advanced degree because she would need three of
                    four years to complete her Ph.D., and I knew we couldn't be at one place at that
                    time. She deferred to my career, and we made a deal that we would pursue a
                    traditional family. We both agreed that a traditional family is a very honorable
                    and important family structure to have and we dedicated ourselves to each other.
                    That was painful, difficult, particularly with pitifully low Foreign Service
                    salaries that limited our ability to do things. We were only in Washington for
                    very short period of time and we went to Korea.</p>

                <p>BINDENAGEL: Dr. Henry Kissinger administered the oath of office to our class,
                    which was one of the largest and most diverse incoming Foreign Service classes.
                    It was large because it was called at the end of the fiscal year, which ended on
                    June 30 at that time. Apparently, the State Department had hired few people
                    during the year and was rushing around trying to fill the open positions before
                    the end of the fiscal year. We had over a hundred people. Some 20 members of the
                    class came from USIA, three of four from Agriculture, and of course most for the
                    Foreign Service. We had tremendous diversity of backgrounds and people. Mostly
                    people around 24 to 26 years old. Agriculture people were much older in that
                    respect, but basically that same generation of late '60s early '70s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In talking to your classmates, how did they feel about the
                        America's role in the world at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: There was a very strong sense of purpose. That spoke to my background
                    from South Dakota. I recall some speaker to the incoming class getting up and
                    saying that you folks are joining the “Foreign Service of the United States,”
                    not the State Department; yours is a career for our country and there are many
                    things that you can possibly achieve. It was that sense of purpose, of
                    commitment, of loyalty, of Esprit de Corps that certainly inspired me. We then
                    broke into smaller groups and talked about the political issues of the day. What
                    had happened in Vietnam was of course always present in these discussions. But
                    other thing, the arms race, loomed large. We did an exercise in disarmament on
                    how to build mutual trust. Of course, the process broke down quite easily into
                    mistrust. We also played Diplomacy, the board game, making alliances and
                    breaking them.</p>

                    with a minor in Asian studies. I was delighted that I got my wish, with an
                    assignment to Korea. It was exactly what I wanted and Korea was the only country
                    that I had not studied at the University. I studied of course China, Indonesia,
                    Japan, and Southeast Asia. I knew little about Korea, and this assignment would
                    fill a last piece of what I had anticipated would be a long career in East Asian
                    and Pacific affairs.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: 1975-1977.</p>

                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: I was a Junior Officer in the Economics Section, I was actually a
                    Commercial Officer. Worked for John T. Bennett, who was the most senior
                    economics officer, then we had Jim Marshall, John Perkins to whom I reported
                    directly. John had a little trade center operation, it wasn't official trade
                    center, but it had a little business promotion element, and that's where I spent
                    most of my time. Meeting businessmen and promoting America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think it would have been a very exciting time to
                        be in Korea. A country just reaching a 1000$/capita, obviously it was going
                        to be a interesting market. Economically rather exciting place, wasn't
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: It was very exciting. In Germany I had personally experienced the oil
                    shock of 1973. I was still in Army when the German Government declared
                    driving-free Sundays for three weeks; the German Government banned cars from the
                    streets. Seeing no cars moving in Germany was a shocking experience and made the
                    importance of oil real and immediate. From that oil shock I had gained personal
                    awareness of the tremendous impact the oil crisis was having on economic
                    structures in a country like Germany. When I arrived in Korea, Korea was
                    reaching a level of economic prosperity that was disappearing because they had
                    no natural resources; they had to import oil. Importing expensive oil would wipe
                    out any earnings that they had, and their economy would collapse. Coming into
                    that Korean crisis and seeing these people with very strong Confucian ethic,
                    very strong commitments to education, to achievement and to structured society
                    was exciting. The fact that the local employees would work 18 hours/day without
                    blinking an eye to achieve what they though was necessary was an infectious
                    climate for a strenuous work ethic. We really wanted them to achieve, and we
                    wanted Americans to be a part of their success. We certainly were omni-present,
                    since our commitment in the Korean War.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>AID had had a large mission in Korea and was a dominant force in U.S. economic
                    policy. However, as the AID mission shrunk, the Economic Section expanded its
                    contacts, including to economic leaders like Kim Jae Ik and others who were
                    running the huge economic miracle that was about the occur. The Korean future
                    was certainly uncertain. I had no idea whether they would be able to achieve
                    survival. However, much to the world's surprise by the end of my two years, they
                    had weathered the storm. Some new forms of industrial organization were key to
                    their success, including the chaebol organizations that began to dominate the
                    economy. The Chaebol are large conglomerates, vertically and horizontally
                    integrated conglomerates that are controlled by a very few people and worked
                    hand in clove with the government. Politically the country still had the strong
                    Presidency government of Park Chung Hee, who was ruthless. Before I arrived the
                    North Koreans had sent a patrol into Seoul to assassinate Park Chung Hee. They
                    killed his wife in an attack in downtown Seoul, next to the Embassy's Compound
                    II, where Jean and I lived. So we had a sense the communist North Koreans could
                    infiltrate at will, a feeling that I had never experienced across the Central
                    Front in Europe. Although this event had occurred shortly before I arrived,
                    there were constant reports of infiltrators being picked up. So you had a
                    politically tense situation and an economically fascinating time.</p>
                <p>One important story was when I was duty officer in the second week of the North
                    Korean incident in which two officers were killed. The act “tree trimming”
                    incident in 1976 occurred in the DMZ. The UN Force tree trimming crew had gone
                    into the DMZ to remove tree limbs that had obstructed the UN Forces view to the
                    North. The North Koreans came into the DMZ, isolated the two American officers
                    and killed them. Then we massed an incredible armada and military force to go in
                    and decided to take down the tree. A very dramatic moment in which I, as the
                    Embassy duty officer, delivered State Department messages relating to operations
                    orders to General Stilwell, commander of the UN Forces. With an armada off shore
                    and squadrons of aircraft in support, we cut down the tree, then the tension
                    eased, and we went on with our negotiations, which in the end drew a ten
                    centimeter line across the village of Panmunjom in the DMZ separating the UN
                    Forces from the North Koreans. That was the most dramatic time I had in
                    Korea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that point all was the threat for something from North
                        Korea. That never knew was out of your mind.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Never. The comparison, the analogy I drown from my military time was,
                    we noted that on the 38th parallel occasionally a helicopter would stray into
                    the DMZ and be taken down. That happened in the Central Front often, where we
                    would stray mostly into Czechoslovakia. But there was a dramatic difference in
                    the kind of threat and the constant military action that was on the DMZ. We had
                    visitors constantly. Richard Holbrooke came in 1977 as the Assistant Secretary.
                    I remember being part of the delegation dealing with him. Another distinguished
                    visitor was Governor Busby, who came from Georgia; we had delightful time. One
                    funny moment came at a dinner for Governor Busby, who was a very big man, when
                    he was complimented by his host for having very large ears. Large ears in the
                    Buddhist tradition are a sign of great wisdom. However, the Governor didn't know
                    this fact, and was quite flustered as to what it meant. We were able to tell him
                    and to assure him that this was a very high compliment. With that he, too, burst
                    into laughter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about on the commercial side? In many ways this is
                        where the action was in those days. And the Koreans are an interesting group
                        commercially. Could you tell me about how the Koreans seemed to operate on
                        the commercial side and what were we doing? Were we pushing them to buy our
                        stuff or were we also pushing them to sell in the U.S.? What were we doing
                        at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: What we were trying to do in the Embassy was to promote U.S. exports.
                    Apart from selling to them, there were some joint ventures we promoted. AMPEX,
                    for instance, had invented a video technology and was looking for a partner.
                    AMPEX was trying to sell their videocassettes in Korea. AMPEX developed VHS
                    technologies and was unable to sell them well in the U.S. But in Korea and more
                    importantly in Japan were able to make inroads, and those two took over the
                    manufacture of that video technology and the competed with us in the U.S. So we
                    very much saw this market as a place to sell things and to help them, but they
                    very much used it to gain technologies that we were not exploiting as fast as
                    they could, like the video technologies and they came in as a competitor. VHS
                    came to us via the Japanese afterward, an oft-told story in Korea. We also had
                    was some competition; for instance, the Germans built a diesel motor factory
                    which led to other downstream projects. We encouraged the Koreans to develop
                    their infrastructure, their talent and they were masters at beating us in our
                    own game. The Canadians were building a CANDU nuclear power reactor, and as soon
                    as the welders had learned that high degree of skill at the expense of the
                    foreign investor, they would go off and set up their own companies or move to
                    other employers. Labor was still not trained or paid at the international level.
                    In my time Korea moved from a poor, developing country to an emerging economy as
                    we began to call success stories in Asia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that make you gun shy? You know, you might be able to
                        selsomething once but then it's turned around and they compete with
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: I was there at the earlier stage. That came in the '80s, when we had
                    tremendous trade problems with them. The trade problems we had with Korea were
                    with mushrooms, shoes and textiles. They were the main trade frictions we had,
                    and later in the 1980s they moved to manufacturing and we had other trade
                    problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain why mushrooms?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: In part because Koreans could grow them for a very low price. More
                    importantly, mushrooms in Pennsylvania were disadvantaged and the Senator from
                    Pennsylvania wanted to ensure that his Pennsylvania suppliers to the market were
                    not endangered by this low wage country's competition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in any negotiation one way or the
                        other with the Koreans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: No. I was a junior officer working on promotion, I wasn't really
                    engaged in the negotiations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know. I was running the Consular Section that time and I
                        remember one of my officers, Steven Kennedy, I had to send out. There was a
                        dispute with a Korean firm over shoes or something like that. Koreans who
                        were involved in this were threatening to attack the Americans. I had to
                        send Steve out with the Americans when they left, just to lend a
                        quasi-immunity. Koreans, particularly at the mid-management, they were held
                        accountable for anything that happened. So they could not accept losing a
                        deal or being disadvantaged in a deal, so they got quite upset and almost
                        physical.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: That certainly was constantly in the discussion, and when I said
                    working 18 hours a day I meant factually as well. Koreans were intense,
                    uncompromising, and goal oriented. You could even say that at any cost they were
                    going to win. They were existentially threatened economically, politically and
                    militarily, so it wasn't an issue of negotiation, it was their own existence.
                    That sense permeated all the dealing that I had with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the American Camber of Commerce? I'm really
                        thinking about American manufacturers, not necessarily Chamber of Commerce.
                        But there were quite a few American firms represented there. How were they
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: I really don't recall. They were very active with us in terms of
                    demonstrating their products, and with the trade and economic policy side of the
                    section, on the trade disputes, but I really don't recall.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: The only kind of corruption I saw was the fixation on the name
                    Walker, because general Walker had done wonderful things in the war to protect
                    the country and the role of Johnny Walker scotch which appeared as a gift, as
                    encouragement, sometimes used against you, that's the level of corruption that I
                    saw.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering if there was any concern in the economic
                        sectioabout the role corruption played in the economic development?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Yes, in fact we had with Chaebol, these conglomerates, economic
                    section, commercial section work very closely to try to see how they were
                    organized and what they were doing. They were, however, very closely held
                    organizations and I wasn't able to penetrate them from where I was sitting. We
                    did deal with couple of cases where we tried to expose arms sales that were
                    connected with Chaebol, which had the potential of revealing payoffs or some
                    other corruption. We dealt with the World Trader Data Reports - WTDRs -
                    background material on firms. We would actually try to look at companies and
                    interview them. We had several export control cases, where they may have
                    diverted controlled exports and we needed to make end-user reports. But in terms
                    of corruption, we saw little.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a problem of trying to get American firms to
                        sell things to Korea, Korea being so unknown market? The reason I say this I
                        remember one country team meeting when John Bennett or some one from the
                        Economic Section mentioned the problem that Koreans had been buying a lot of
                        Japanese products and they wanted to buy some American. So they wanted to
                        buy a fire engine. They picked an American company, but it really wasn't
                        interested in selling fire engines abroad, they'd rather stick to the
                        American market. Would you know of a problem...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: I don't know that it was particularly the case with Korea. But
                    certainly at that time exporters were smaller, percentage of exports from the
                    U.S. was very small. The fact that John Bennett and John Perkins wanted to
                    actually have a commercial operation to encourage Americans to come there, it
                    certainly was to encourage and help them to deal with this market, because it
                    was unknown to them. There was a constant theme in the discussion - how we could
                    help? When Elliot Richardson, who was the Commerce Secretary, came and talked
                    about American business, he sent our message back to the U.S. that he was in
                    Korea and Korea was okay. The unknown market syndrome was certainly an issue. I
                    am not so certain that it was a Korean issue as it was an American issue. As
                    regards the Korean interest in not buying the Japanese, that too has a more
                    social, historical, political connection. They didn't want to be dependent on
                    the Japanese who had conquered them in 1905 and subjugated them, and had even
                    abolished all Korean names. This constant latent anti-Japanese feeling did have
                    an effect on purchasing decisions; it was helpful in selling the U.S. as a
                    balance to becoming overly dependent on the Japanese. The same was true for
                    investments; the Japanese sold the Koreans older, dirtier industries that the
                    Japanese didn't want anymore. We had other newer industries for cooperation.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Yes, I was a young, enthusiastic Foreign Service Officer, I was given
                    a mission, and the mission was fun and worthy. The fun thing was it brought me
                    out to the Korean community. I met Korean business men, I went to various places
                    and met people and talked to them about what they were interested in and what
                    they wanted to do, made connections with businessmen. For me it was an
                    opportunity to be out with the Koreans to understand what was happening, and as
                    Junior Officer that was ideal. It was delightful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know from the Consular Section's viewpoint, we were
                        giving visas to an astounding number of Koreans who were going to graduate
                        schools at absolutely first-rate Universities. Were you seeing this in the
                        economic field or was this at the beginning?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: That was happening in fact, you reminded me that in fact when I was
                    at the University of South Dakota, Bill Farber, the professor that headed the
                    Government Department, was interviewing prospective professors. He would bring
                    in students to meet with these candidates to be professors. One of them was a
                    Korean. His name was Zeon, pronounced “Chun.” I had met a young aspiring
                    graduate student professor at South Dakota and then I found him again as a
                    businessman in Korea, years later. In some sense, indeed, the presence, the
                    emphasis on higher education, the need to go the U.S., Kim Jae Ik, who was
                    tragically assassinated in Burma a few years later, attended the University of
                    Oklahoma, if I remember correctly. There was tremendous interaction and it did
                    have a tremendous impact in Korea.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get out at all from the Commercial Section for the
                        ricbusiness?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Absolutely. We have a lot of rice in the U.S., and we were selling a
                    certain kind from Louisiana, which was not a favorite kind in Korea, but since
                    it came under the Commodity Credit Corporation and Food for Peace programs and
                    was supported very much by a Congressman from Louisiana, Otto Passman. His
                    visits were very good political lessons. When Otto Passman came to visit the
                    fact that we had a very large government program supporting his State's crops in
                    a recipient country, the Koreans lavished him with gifts and entertainment and
                    they took the rice, whether they liked it or not. I did see this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you end up sort of as an escort officer for him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: I was around, I was never his control officer but I was around in
                    several of his meetings and activities. Certainly the agriculture section,
                    economic section paid very close attention to anything he wanted. It was
                    actually AID, Dennis Barrett who was his control officer. Dennis handled him
                    very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There became a minor scandal, Koreagate, about rice. There
                        was young Korean lady who worked for the Congress - Osuzi or something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Yes that's right. That was a Washington event though, not a Seoul
                    event. I remember the Koreans were very proud of this armored boat they built in
                    1597, it was called the turtle-ship, to fight against the Japanese. And
                    Congressman Otto Passman was given a small, but nice replica in pure silver.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am told that a certain Congressman would arrive, and
                        they'd brush aside the control officers and would go to a hotel where a
                        tailor would be to suit them up, and then young ladies would arrive to
                        soothe their nerves and what have you, and it was of this nature...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: I did see the suits, they were delivered to the hotel othe Embassy,
                    and there were a lot of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in '77. In your impression where was
                        Koreeconomically at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Korea had made great strides economically, but none politically. They
                    still were highly leveraged, however, and had expanded their manufacturing
                    capabilities. One stellar example was the supertankers they were building. They
                    were determined to protect their shipbuilding industry. They had actually built
                    a supertanker that had been launched and was of course to be the future of oil
                    shipping. They had begun to manufacture a Hyundai automobile, the Pony, which
                    later became simply Hyundai. They had an engine plant, they had achieved, in my
                    view they had gone through a critical period and they needed to proceed down
                    that path. Obviously they didn't make the structural changes and today we see
                    the facts. But at that point they were well on their way and they had gotten
                    through the crises.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking about today as most of Asia has gone
                        through crises, about too cozy relationships between the government, banks
                        and industry and all. So they will have to work their way out of it and it
                        just happened, in the last few months.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: And the three sets of books that the highly leveragestructures that
                    they had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you mean when you say “highly leveraged”
                        structure?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Businesses had many loans and always very short on cash, running on
                    cash flow and when the cash flow runs out, you cannot pay the loans.
                    Consequently, they faced collapse. Now, in February 1998, I understand that they
                    are reorganizing Chaebol, their big conglomerates as well as their relationships
                    with the government and banks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And in '77 you went whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: It's an interesting story and an important story about the Foreign
                    Service and how assignments are made. I was assigned to The Hague. En route to
                    my assignment and before leaving Korea, I learned to my dismay that my position
                    in The Hague had been upgraded and someone else had been assigned to it, so I
                    was unassigned. By then I had learned that in Foreign Service you had not only
                    your performance to worry about, and how you deal about it, but also how you
                    deal with people. The DCM's secretary Roz Fishman at the time wrote a letter to
                    her former boss, David Anderson who was office director for Central Europe in
                    the Department. In that letter she mentioned that I was a good young officer, or
                    something to that effect, and that he should take a look at me. David needed
                    someone to fill a position. I became his candidate and was assigned to
                    Bremen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was his first boss.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: David was a great boss to me. At the time, David was faced with
                    closing the Consulate General in Bremen and he didn't want to close it. He had a
                    vacancy in Bremen. There were three officers and a vacancy had appeared. The
                    central system was not planning to fill it as a way of slowly cutting down and
                    closing the consulate. David, having heard from his former secretary Roz that I
                    was unassigned, had me assigned to Bremen. Some where between my departure from
                    Korea, my home leave and arriving in Washington I was assigned to Bremen, much
                    to my delight. I was sent to FSI, the Foreign Service Institute, for 12 weeks of
                    German, and then on to Bremen. [There was of course more to the story. I learned
                    subsequently that Larry Eagleburger, who was assistant secretary for European
                    affairs at the time, had arranged a meeting with Secretary Henry Kissinger for
                    German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, whose law firm was in Bremen.
                    Genscher made an impassioned plea directly to Kissinger to keep the consulate in
                    Bremen open. Kissinger yelled at Eagleburger for setting him up to make a
                    decision on Bremen. Eagleburger, who was a close friend of David Anderson, did
                    just that and the consulate was saved from the axe.]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Bremen from 1977-79. What was your job in
                        Bremen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: I was one of three FSOs; I was the Economics Officer. We had the
                    ConsuGeneral, Irv Schiffman, and a consular officer, first Doug Hunter and then
                    Joyce O'Keefe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you describe Bremen in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Bremen was a small consulate with two important historical and
                    political connections with the U.S. First, for the citizens, the Bremer,
                    American occupation after World War II kept the independence of the city-state
                    of Bremen. We prevented Bremen from being joined to Lower Saxony, which was part
                    of the British Occupation Zone. We needed a ocean port to supply our troops in
                    the South, and we chose was Bremerhaven the port of Bremen, which was separated
                    by a little bit of the Lower Saxony. Second, Bremen was important for U.S.
                    interests, particularly as we implemented the Master Restationing Plan in the
                    1970s when we decided to build an Army base at Gerlstedt, and deploy an Army
                    unit there. Strategically, this deployment was a part of the “master
                    restationing plan” which would deny the Soviets a route of entry into Germany.
                    Alexander Haig told me a couple a years ago that he had met a KGB officer after
                    the fall of The Berlin Wall, who explained the Soviet assassination attempt on
                    him as the Supreme Allied Commander, I believe. The Soviets wanted to remove him
                    as the strategic thinker that had blocked their invasion access across the North
                    German Plain. They didn't want this plan or such thinking to continue. Whether
                    it's true or not, the point is that Bremen had a very strategic and historical
                    connection to the United States. We also had economic connections with Bremen's
                    cotton exchange as well as its tobacco exchange.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>The tobacco market was very interesting. When the Indonesians gained independence
                    from Dutch after the Second World War, they moved their sale of tobacco from the
                    Netherlands to Bremen. All Dutch tobacconists had to travel to Bremen to buy
                    their Dutch East Indies tobacco. Making the Dutch travel to Germany, who the
                    Dutch blamed for the Second World War, was the most humiliating act the
                    Indonesians could impose on the Dutch. And tobacco, of course, has its own
                    political connection to the U.S. Ninety percent of the American tobacco is grown
                    in North Carolina and the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
                    today always played an important role, Senator Jesse Helms, who also intervened
                    with the State Department to keep the consulate open. Consequently, tobacco was
                    important to me in the whether to close the post or not. My job was to supervise
                    two very effective German Foreign Service National Employees, Peter Berben and
                    Chrystal Wagner, who prepared the reporting for Germany on cotton and
                    tobacco.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any concern at that time about promoting,
                        assisting, tobacco?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: None.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are looking today at tobacco as a major export but we

                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: No, we were very much market oriented and how to get Virginia and
                    Burley tobaccos into German cigarettes and to expand the market. There were
                    important cigarette manufacturers in Bremen and in Hamburg, BAT (British
                    American Tobacco) and Reemtsma for instance. We traveled to Hamburg, the other
                    German port city, to prepare the tobacco reports. Tobacco was a very active and
                    very important industry for us at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There had been a hiatus, the Vietnam war was over by this
                        time. How were Americans viewed would you say in Bremen, was there a
                        difference between what you saw as an Army officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Certainly. First of all we were only three or four Americans in this
                    city about the size of Washington, DC, 600,000 people or so. The consulate was
                    very much a part of Bremen's social life and its politics. In addition, we had a
                    small contingent in the city of NASA employees. The space project that the US
                    government was working with the German government on was the palette to carry
                    the space lab, which was being constructed in Bremen. So we had National
                    Aeronautical Space Agency, six or seven official Americans in the “Development
                    Ring North” (Enwicklungsringnord) of Daimler- Benz corporation in Bremen. And in
                    fact our NASA colleagues also played an important role in the community with
                    visits by congressmen like Dan Pasqua, by diplomats and by scientists from the
                    Montgomery, Alabama space center. One of those visits I hosted a group of
                    American and German scientists for a reception at the Consul General's residence
                    between the departure of CG Schiffman and the arrival of his successor, Ralph
                    Graner. It was absolutely fascinating to hear the stories of the Americans, who
                    were German scientists at Peenemunde with Werner von Braun during World War II.
                    They had developed the V-2 rocket, which became the basis for the U.S. Delta
                    rocket program. Most Americans experience was centered on the U.S. military
                    presence as in my own in Bavaria, when I was with the Third Infantry Division.
                    In Bremen we never had a large military presence, and we diplomats gave the
                    Germans a different view of America, a rather normal group of Americans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bremen is part of what State?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: It's the city-state.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: City-state itself. It was SPD?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: It was run by the social democrats for many years. The mayor was Hans
                    Koschnik for 12-15 years. He was a conservative social democrat and the kind of
                    social democrat as Helmut Schmidt. The politics at the time were absolutely
                    fascinating. We had the Social Democrats with the large majority, the F.D.P., a
                    small liberal party, and then you had a Christian Democratic Union party of
                    about 30%. The social make-up of the city reflected basically the make up of the
                    political parties. The largest group was the Protestants, the smallest group
                    were Catholic. Socially, it was interesting for us. We met an American citizen,
                    although he was really a German, Gustav Rasch. Mr. Rasch had been in tobacco
                    business, his father's tobacco business. He was in the U.S. in 1938, learning
                    the tobacco business, when he was interviewed about the contemporary Chancellor
                    and the time, Mr. Hitler. Not speaking English very well, he was asked what he
                    thought of “Mr. Hitler.” And hearing the colloquial American English for a non-
                    committal statement “He's a good SOB [son of a bitch].” He described Hitler as
                    an SOB. Not long thereafter, he got a letter from his father in Bremen saying
                    “Gestapo has visited us, you shouldn't come home at this time.” His comment
                    apparently was published at the local American newspaper and then in The New
                    York Times. The Gestapo had read it, interviewed his father and Gustav stayed in
                    the U.S. When the war broke out, he was interned in Indiana as an enemy alien
                    and then drafted into the U.S. Army. He became an American citizen en route to
                    the Pacific Theater. He was taken off the troop ship at San Francisco harbor
                    with several others, sworn-in as a citizen and returned to the troop ship which
                    then proceeded to the Pacific war. At the end of the war he was sent to Germany
                    in the occupation and negotiated his way backto Bremen. In the late 1970s, he
                    introduced us to his circle of friends; he was very nice to us. Although he had
                    children that were somewhat younger than we were, he included us as “family” and
                    part of his circle. Our circle expanded with the addition of the flour mill
                    manufacturer and some other people in the community. We found ourselves
                    wondering why we were so welcomed into this city of Bremen, at least into this
                    group. The mystery was solved when we found out that they and we were all
                    Catholic. No one had said a word about religion; it was simply a reflection of
                    the social life in the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Germany at that time, I don't' know how it is today, there
                        was much more of a division one doesn't think about very much, as an
                        American about this Catholic/Protestant division. I remember my wife was
                        addressing Catholic girl-scouts and there were Protestant girl-scouts in the
                        same little town, and all that. Did you find religious differences an
                        important factor?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Religion was very much an important factor but not so religious. It
                    was a social factor. In fact, German society is organized in circles of
                    organizations, whether they are clubs, the Catholic church group, the Protestant
                    church group, soccer teams, business clubs, bankers groups, and most other
                    hobbies and sports. The society is structured that way. History and religion
                    have shaped social networks built around their churches. Today attendance at
                    church is rare, but religion still is the basis of the society's structure. We
                    didn't even realize our inclusion was based on a religious connection because it
                    was almost entirely social. We were invited to go biking, ice skating, hiking
                    along the canals. We enjoyed dinner parties, birthdays, anniversaries and other
                    special occasions with our friends, who were also Catholic. The Protestants did
                    the same, again politically organized around the social democrats, they didn't
                    talk about being Protestant, they talked about being Social Democrats.</p>

                        didn't get along very well, and it was particularly over the so-called
                        neutron bomb. Did that play any part in what you all were doing, did you get
                        any reverberations from that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what the issue was?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: We come back into Germany after a three-year absence and the
                    political debate had changed from U.S. troop deployments to nuclear issuerockets
                    and bombs. Jimmy Carter had proposed a bomb that would destroy people but leave
                    buildings intact, the so-called “neutron bomb.” He proposed to counter
                    deployments from the Soviet Union, the so-called SS-20 missile, and Helmut
                    Schmidt had given a speech in 1977 to the IISS, asking that the U.S. do
                    something to counter the Soviet threat. Jimmy Carter's response was to deploy
                    the neutron bomb. The reaction in Germany was so negative because it was
                    appalling to think that you could kill the people but not destroy the buildings.
                    Helmut Schmidt backed off his very subtle request and Jimmy Carter then withdrew
                    the idea of having the neutron bomb. Carter's turnabout of course got a visceral
                    reaction against the U.S. We were weak and could not defend Germany.
                    Consequently, we had a very serious debate about our steadfastness in the face
                    of the Soviet threat of the SS-20. The issue also hit a personal level when
                    Schmidt went to visit President Carter. President Carter was a very active early
                    morning riser, who wanted to be constantly on the go, and invited Helmut Schmidt
                    to an early morning breakfast. Well, Helmut Schmidt is what Germans call a
                    “Morgenmuffel;” he was cranky, cantankerous in the morning. Since it was a
                    President of the U.S. inviting him, he came, but he was not in a good mood. As a
                    result of this morning meeting, their relationship never worked, at least from
                    my point of view. Of course, there were other things that overcame their
                    individual differences but it was always tension. That tension played out in the
                    neutron bomb with neither side really being certain of the other.</p>
                <p>You could even argue that Helmut Schmidt's push for European Monetary System
                    (EMS), which was announced in Bremen in 1978 at a European Community Summit,
                    demonstrated a European independence. President Carter's comments about the
                    Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the consequent U.S. military build-up, frame
                    the uncertain relationship between the two leaders. The Carter administration in
                    1979/80, before leaving the office, increased the defense budget in recognition
                    of the Soviet threat after the invasion of Afghanistan, but by then the nature
                    of the relationship with Germans was sour, at least from what we could see there
                    in Bremen.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>Politically, this played out in Bremen, our little corner of Germany, the Green
                    Party seized the opportunity to offered by the debate over anti-nuclear
                    sentiment, including anti-neutron bomb and anti-nuclear energy issue. The Greens
                    took the fear of meltdown and nuclear waste and damage to the environment along
                    with the fear of a nuclear war and won tremendous political support. Dr. Petra
                    Kelly, whom I knew well, was a German who had studied at American University,
                    became a leading spokesperson for the movement. She was an abandoned child
                    adopted by an American GI. Kelly participated in the anti-Vietnam War movement
                    in the U.S., which greatly affected her views on war and the United States. You
                    had Otto Schily, who had a very different background, coming from and SPD family
                    in the Ruhr area of Germany, anti-Nazi, very anti-authoritarian movement. He
                    later became Justice Minister in the Schr�der SPD-Green Government in 1998. Rudy
                    Dutschke, who was one of the '68 revolutionaries in Germany, and who had been
                    shot by police in a Berlin demonstration at the end of the 1960s also appeared
                    in Bremen. All these and many other personalities converged in an election in
                    September of 1979 in Bremen, where the Greens for the first time were elected to
                    a State Parliament. That threw German domestic politics into a political
                    upheaval. I remember going with our political reporter that evening at the
                    parliament, when the results were coming in, and taking to Petra Kelly and Otto
                    Schily. She introduced me to Rudy Dutschke. We saw a tremendous amount of
                    anti-war, pro-Communist feeling in that anti-democratic party being elected into
                    the democratic political system in Germany on the Central Front. The Greens
                    appearance on the political scene became a very unsettling development in
                    German-American relations. It was for me delight to write three of four cables
                    that talked about this new arrival to the political scene, to give some
                    political reporting into the Department. It was a surprise for a small consulate
                    to be in the thick of things, and it was a very exciting development for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at the Green Party, which today is a respectable
                        party buat this time was not very respectable...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you and other people in the consulate beginning to
                        take a look at this party on the ground and see that it was different than
                        it was being portrayed in the U.S., less Soviet control and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: There were several political groups in the Greens coalition. This new
                    movement was noticed not only in our Consulate, but also in Frankfurt and
                    several other places. In our case in Bremen a “Citizens Initiative” was created
                    to prevent the building of the Hellman House which was a building right on the
                    ramparts around the historic site. These citizens' initiatives were grassroots
                    democratic individuals that we sought out and reported on their activities. As
                    for the Petra Kellys and Otto Schilys, we were very uncertain where they would
                    go and how they would move. As for Rudy Dutschke, we were concerned about his
                    association with the Greens and his activities, which we thought were
                    anti-authoritarian, anti-democratic. The Green movement was very hard for us to
                    sort out and to determine what direction the Greens would go.</p>
                <p>I spent most of my time, then and later, with Petra Kelly, and in the group that
                    developed around her and Otto Schily. They had an internal conflict whether they
                    would really fight against the democratic system or fight against individual
                    issues, like the construction of the Brockdorf nuclear power plant, which they
                    protested after I left Bremen. The German police and Grenzschutz, border patrol,
                    used helicopters to combat them at Brockdorf. That police action made a very
                    dramatic scene that heightened the confrontation. The German government didn't
                    know how to deal with this new force, which was willing to do things like sit on
                    the railroad tracks and try to divert trains to and the construction of the
                    nuclear waste site at Gorleben. They were willing to chain themselves to trees.
                    They had popular support but they were a very mixed bag of individuals with
                    different backgrounds and commitments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find, the German government has always had a
                        reputation, whatever government it is, of being rather heavy-handed dealing
                        with things? Was there any truism to this or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: One of the things that you develop after a long period of time in a
                    country is experience and understanding of peoples' reaction to all sorts of
                    situations. You mentioned the split between the Catholics and the Protestants.
                    Of course, the Thirty Years War was a worst case conflict where the population
                    of Germany was reduced by 40 percent. That war had tremendous effect on German
                    thought throughout time. Even Hegelian dialectic, I would argue informally here
                    that such thinking - taking one extreme position on one side and another extreme
                    view on the other leading to confrontation and ending in a synthesis of views -
                    is very much a German intellectual process which probably came from the Thirty
                    Years War. Consequently, Germans' extreme reactions could be explained. When the
                    German Government was confronted with something like the Greens, their first
                    reaction was extreme.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>There is a tendency to react harshly and very forcefully with the idea that the
                    other side will do the same and there will be a clash. And then the issue
                    becomes one of finding the synthesis from the clash. Whether you find a
                    synthesis or only confrontation is an open question. Of course, we focus on
                    confrontation as a German reaction or even as a trademark of German negotiation.
                    Americans focus in the first instance on consensus trying to build consensus and
                    keep harmony. And only when consensus and harmony breaks down do we move to
                    confrontation and to unconditional surrender. I personally have so often engaged
                    in this debate about how to interpret German reactions and how to react to their
                    reactions. This human dynamic is a constant theme in our relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find, speaking of this, in a German education... I
                        know that the French have the way of looking at things which, to the
                        American, the American is more likely to try to make order out of chaos,
                        whereas the French think that somebody deliberately made the chaos and
                        what's behind it or something like that. There is a different way of looking
                        at things. Did you find that German education turned out a different type of
                        thought process with the people you were dealing with, how they looked at
                        situations, than you as an American would?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Yes. Germany's historical experience was chaotic. The discontinuities
                    of their history make it difficult to create the stability we enjoy in the
                    United States. As a result there is a focus in education, business and
                    government in rule making. If you can only have the right rule and everybody
                    follow suit, social peace will follow. Social peace and order in the work place
                    become highest priorities. The problem is of course when you don't have
                    discontinuities and disruptions. After long periods of continuity and social
                    peace, you have a lot of rules; you have today rules on rules on rules. This
                    encrustment of rules spawns rigidities and the society is unable to break out of
                    its rules, even when it must in order to progress. And that is the political
                    situation in Germany today. That rigid rule enforcement was the basis of the
                    protests in an otherwise socially peaceful country when the Greens made their
                    political debut. Everyone feared a new discontinuity that would threaten the
                    entire fabric of society. And since the Greens came from the university
                    experience of relative freedom from rules, they refused to be traditional. The
                    rest of society was trying to impose order on the chaos but the Greens didn't.
                    The Greens refused to be a traditional political party, in fact they refused
                    even to take the name “party” and called themselves a Green Movement, the
                    Greens. The Greens did not fit the mold and it was very hard for an educated or
                    informed public to deal with this new political force in Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about as Economic Officer, did you find that we played
                        much of a role or was it quite diminished compared to what it would be in
                        Korea, because of, obviously trade lines had been established since 1820s or
                        something like that, and I would think there wouldn't be much need for
                        somebody to get in between this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: That's absolutely correct. The old trading patterns were well
                    established. What I found was a personal example of economic relations between
                    the U.S. and Germany. We discovered to our delight that one of my wife's
                    ancestors actually had come from Bremen and immigrated into the U.S. in the
                    1850s. Herman Theophilus Plate was a prime example of trading ties; he was the
                    Bremen Consul to Philadelphia, 1856-61. Of course a consul at that time was
                    really a businessman, and his business was trading cotton and tobacco, which in
                    1856 in Philadelphia was a good deal. By 1861, however, he had a problem when
                    the Union blockaded the Confederate States and cut off his supply of cotton and
                    tobacco. He had other interests as well. In 1859, when oil was discovered at
                    Titusville, Pennsylvania, he along with a Bremen merchant, Mr. Schuette,
                    exported some of this black oil to Bremen. It was one of the first oil shipments
                    from the U.S. to Bremen. To our dismay we learned that he discontinued his oil
                    export business, thinking that, as the family history says, that it would never
                    replace whale oil in lamps. Meanwhile Herr Schuette went on to work with Mr.
                    Rockefeller, but that's a different story.</p>
                <p>There were discontinuities in trade as well. Quite naturally they were
                    interrupted by the two world wars, but afterwards, as with our friend Gustav
                    Rasch, these old connections reasserted themselves. It is clear that a young
                    second-tour Foreign Service Officer in Bremen, could not create great strides in
                    our relationship or bring much value added to tobacco and cotton trade, but I
                    could learn about Germany. For me the real value of being in the consulate, a
                    small place where contact with all sorts of Germans, cotton and tobacco
                    merchants or the flour miller. You could actually connect to the politicians in
                    the city and they were interested in including you in events. We had a few
                    official visitors like Congressmen Pasqua who came to the science center working
                    on the space shuttle. We spent a lot of time with the space scientists working
                    on the space lab pallet which was then shipped to the U.S. We had a different
                    kind of experience, but value added compared to Korea, we were not as
                    active.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your feeling at that time, obviously this was
                        going to change over time, but had the Germans worked themselves out of
                        World War II at this time or was this still... I mean trying not to be too
                        assertive on the international scene, was this at all...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: No, we were in W�rzburg, Germany, when the Federal Republic, West
                    Germany became 25 years old. My 25th birthday coincided with their 25th
                    anniversary discussions. The debates begun in 1974 continued during our time in
                    Bremen. The Germans had very serious discussions about how they had come through
                    the first 25 years, how much they had yet to do, how to deal with the Third
                    Reich history, whether to end the ban on all Nazi symbols and other topics.
                    There was a discussion about neo-Nazis and how disruptive they were. The Germans
                    in 1978 were still very much working through their own history and had not come
                    to the terms with the Hitler regime. The division of the country was also a
                    constant question, the threat of the Soviet Union was certainly constant.In our
                    encounters with the space community we had a special insight into the debate.
                    During a Marshall Space Center visit with half a dozen scientists from the U.S.
                    who were actually German scientists who had been picked up from Peenemunde, the
                    V-2 rocket base, at the end of the war. I hosted a reception for them, which
                    turned out to be a tremendously fun evening. They regaled us with stories about
                    their experiences in Peenemunde inventing the V2 rocket. They related the trials
                    and successes of the V-2; how they had succeeded in launching it. They then
                    exchanged stories about their work on the Delta Program and the other space
                    programs of the U.S. For me it was a strange bridge between two worlds here were
                    the same people in now in responsible U.S. positions, who had personal World War
                    II experiences in the rockets that Hitler had used against the Allies. One
                    generation was not enough to heal the wounds of the Second World War. Divided
                    Germany in 1978 was not a finished product.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about, you are close to the Netherlands. Particularly
                        after the WWII there was not a warm and cozy relationship between the Dutch
                        and Germans, particularly on the side of the Dutch. Obviously they were
                        still the same generation that had been taken over by the Germans. Was that
                        still a problem, did you see that where you were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: There were virtually no relations from Bremen towards Dutch. The only
                    one that was active was tobacco. We kept close contact with Gustav Rasch and he
                    took us to the Dutch tobacco market in Bremen. In so far as that is an example,
                    the Dutch did not like coming to Bremen to buy and sell the tobacco. There were
                    basically no relations. On the other hand the social life, which connects that
                    part oFriesland in Germany with Friesland in the Netherlands, was a link. We had
                    a very harsh winter in 1978 and for the first time in several years they flooded
                    the fields. We went out with some friends, Gustav and some other friends to go
                    ice-skating. Normally you could go ice-skating on the canals, but they flooded
                    the fields and you could skate, as they used to be able to do, from Bremen all
                    the way into to the Netherlands and back on wooden ice-skates with a metal blade
                    that would strap onto your shoes, called “Hollander” in Germany. So, in some
                    sense there was a connection at some time with the Netherlands, but it was not
                    so political.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the shipping business? One traditional job of a
                        consulate is to deal with shipping and American seamen. But our shipping had
                        fallen off out, what about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: We had a very few cases, but we did have a few and as the back-up
                    Consular Officer, I had a few encounters with sailors. We had several cases
                    where we signed sailors off ships, and a couple of disciplinary cases where the
                    Captains of the ship would bring them in and pay them off in our presence. We
                    also took depositions, not many, but enough to get that flavor that there was
                    still a role for the consulate. Interesting consular issues that I dealt there
                    with were things like young Germans whose parents, normally a mother, who was a
                    German and the father was an American. They wanted American citizenship.</p>
                <p>Around that time in 1977 there was apparently a case in the U.S. where an
                    American had joined the Israeli Army and therefore lost his citizenship, He
                    fought in U.S. Court to retain it and was successful. Young Germans who were
                    also young American citizens had to fulfill their Bundeswehr service and
                    consequently swear their allegiance to the German Army. They didn't want to lose
                    their citizenship and under this new ruling could keep their American passports.
                    We had several of them coming in and said “I don't want to lose my American
                    citizenship.” We also had American teachers who in the late '60s and early '70s
                    couldn't get jobs in the U.S. and came to Germany. They, too, were required to
                    swear allegiance to Germany in order to teach. As they reached five years and
                    were eligible for tenure, they had to decide whether to stay in Germany. Because
                    each year they had signed allegiance to the German federal state as part of
                    their contract, that act brought into question their American citizenship. We
                    had several of those cases where we had to deal with the American's decisions
                    about their lives and how they related to the U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The laws were relaxing all the time. This was the period
                        when the courts made it almost impossible unless you wanted to lose your
                        citizenship.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Right, we were in that transition when faced with such cases. The
                    German law allowed for citizenship to pass through the husband only and not the
                    wife, so they were very often caught in personal crises. It was all a good
                    learning experience and was very interesting. We had a few repatriation cases
                    for destitute Americans as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you feel any, the hand of the control of the Embassy
                        much?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: No. We had Ambassador Stoessel visit us; he set a very friendly
                    embassy-consulate connection. Frank Meehan, the DCM, came. I remember Dick
                    Smyser, the Political Counselor, came several times. Perhaps they were
                    interested in us but more likely I assume they were curious about the Greens.
                    Those visits were very friendly and very interesting, but for the most part the
                    Embassy left us alone. We had more competition with Chuck Kiselyak in Hamburg.
                    When the Longshoreman's strike broke out in Bremen, the first in a hundred
                    years, we sent out the first cable and we had competition from Chuck who said:
                    “But really, all the shipping is in Hamburg.” Nevertheless, we were allowed to
                    report on the Longshoremen strike and I was able to do important reporting.
                    Bremen was very congenial, very fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like an excellent place to sort of get a feel
                        for botthe country and the job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Absolutely. It was certainly not high pressure, but there was ability
                    to develop and explore things and to really get to know how you relate to the
                    Foreign Service and to political, economic and consular issues. And it was broad
                    enough, from cotton, tobacco, space science, the Longshoremen's strike, to the
                    Greens political movement. There were plenty of things to do and yet time to
                    absorb them and understand how they related to foreign policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I thought we might stop at this point, because it's easier
                        to stop here, because you were leaving Bremen in 1979 and you were going
                        back to German Desk, where you served until 1983. So we'll pick it up
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is February 27, 1998. J.D., you were on the German desk wheto when?</p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: I was a desk officer from the summer of 1980 to thsummer of 1983.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did the German desk, could you describe how big it
                        was, hoit was organized and what you were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: The German desk has a delightful history. I understand that it was
                    really organized by Eleanore Dulles, as Office of German Affairs. It had an
                    esteemed group of directors who guided German policy through all the post-war
                    period. The Office included the Federal Republic of Germany, (West Germany), the
                    German Democratic Republic of Germany (East Germany), Berlin, Austria and
                    Switzerland. It was the center of policy for the German-speaking countries of
                    Central Europe. I really focused on our policy towards Germany, East/West
                    Germany, issues dealing with the whole range of political issues, domestic
                    political issues, and economic issues. And it also had a separate desk for
                    Berlin because Berlin had a special status and was treated neither as a part of
                    the GDR nor a part of the Federal Republic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was it treated that way? Was it to avoid legal
                        complicationor was it because of the facts of the matter?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: It was a legal issue. We developed a very extensive legal regime
                    around our rights and responsibilities as victorious powers of World War II for
                    Berlin and Germany as a whole. Those responsibilities included the joint Four
                    Powers “occupation” of Berlin, and the residual rights for Germany as a whole,
                    of course devolving much responsibility to the two Germanies. But in Berlin that
                    joint occupation still remained, at least technically, operational. That limited
                    sovereignty for the Germanies left the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France
                    and the U.S. sharing decision making over Berlin and as unification came later,
                    we were to exercise the residual rights and responsibilities for Germany as a
                    whole.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your particular slice of this pie?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: I was one of three Desk Officers on the German Desk, and my slice
                    included German domestic politics and economics. I must say economics was one
                    aspect that was very political at that time. I recall two incidents that
                    describe the role of an economics officer at the desk at that time, and
                    political significance of it. The first was when President Reagan named Dr.
                    Arthur Burns, the former Chairman of the Federal Reserve, to be Ambassador to
                    Germany. He came to the State Department and met with the Office of Central
                    European Affairs. As I introduced myself as the desk officer for economics,
                    Arthur Burns, also an esteemed professor of economics, creator of the Council of
                    Economic Advisors as well as former Federal Reserve Chairman, looked at me and
                    smiled, and said, “Economics? The State Department?” and then knowingly shook
                    his head in disbelief. Nevertheless, we came to win him over to the important
                    role the State Department plays in the “political” economics. For instance, the
                    issues that dominated the German-American relationship focused on the German
                    economy and the unemployment at that time.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>Germany's commitment to social peace was deep. After World War I and the German
                    Revolution of 1918 as well as after World War II, unemployment led to violent
                    riots. In 1918 severe unemployment actually lead to a revolution, consequently,
                    the Germans were prepared to go to great lengths to maintain social peace, with
                    spending programs, job programs, to provide for peace at the expense a more
                    capitalist, laissez-faire economics. We in the U.S. view economics in a much
                    more detached way of promoting prosperity rather than from the violent politics
                    that lead to revolution. However, in 1982 the German unemployment figures
                    reached about the million, and the Social Democrats under Helmut Schmidt were
                    politically threatened. The SPD response was to propose a jobs program. However,
                    their political coalition government partners, the liberal thinking,
                    capitalist-oriented Free Democrats, prominently led by the Economics Minister,
                    Otto Graf Lambsdorf, opposed this SPD-proposed social program.</p>
                <p>In the U.S. the economic debate had focused on Ronald Reagan's supply-side
                    economic policy, which in German the longest word that I was able to use at the
                    time; it was “Angebotsorientierte Wirtschaftspolitik” when translated directly
                    from “supply-side economics.” Otto Graf Lambsdorf proposed such a policy as an
                    alternative to the SPD plan. In the spring the Social Democrats were unable to
                    pass their jobs program in the Bundestag, over the opposition of their coalition
                    partners, the Free Democrats. However, when they sought to fund it through the
                    budget process in June, their partner's opposition foiled them. By September,
                    Economics Minister Lambsdorf presented a paper on supply-side economics prepared
                    by Economics Ministry State Secretary, Mr. Tietmeyer, who later became the
                    President of the Bundesbank. Chancellor Schmidt was unable to block Lambsdorf or
                    to convince him to remain in the coalition. The Free Democrats left the
                    coalition on October 1, 1982 bringing to an end the Helmut Schmidt government.
                    The Free Democrats then under Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, with
                    Economics Minister Otto Graf Lambsdorf, joined in coalition with the Christian
                    Democratic Union to elect Helmut Kohl as the Chancellor in October of 1982.</p>
                <p>I was in Bonn at the time. The State Department sent us desk officers to visit
                    our countries and “consult.” The intense debate over economics was my excuse to
                    travel and get a better understanding for the events that were unfolding. I met
                    with the political parties, the political foundations and of course the
                    Ausw�rtiges Amt. I had an appointment in the Foreign Office with Wolfgang
                    Ischinger, who had just returned to Germany from his assignment in Washington,
                    where I had met him. He was in Foreign Minister Genscher's office. As I arrived
                    in the Foreign Office on October 1, everyone was gathered around the television
                    watching the Foreign Minister announce the withdrawal of the F.D.P. from the
                    governing coalition. Of course the F.D.P. ministers all had to resign and the
                    Foreign Office was abuzz with dire predictions of their individual fates.
                    Wolfgang was totally preoccupied, but I was delighted to share this moment with
                    them. Chancellor Schmidt became German Foreign Minister for the three weeks it
                    took to form the new Kohl-Genscher coalition.</p>

                <p>My trip was cut short a few days later during my consultations in Berlin when I
                    was called by the Operations Center and patched through to George Washington
                    University hospital to learn of my son, Carl's, premature birth. I raced home to
                    see him and his mother; he survived.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Helmut Kohl is still the Chancellor, he is running again this
                    September of 1998 for an unprecedented sixth term. He has exceeded the term of
                    office of Konrad Adenauer and is approaching the term of office of Otto
                    Bismarck.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any change in our approach to Germany as seen
                        througyour work, when Reagan administration came in, in January 1981?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Absolutely, there was a very good relationship with West Germans, we
                    had almost no relationship with the Communist East Germans by design. Up until
                    1974 we had no official relations what so ever with East Germany. We established
                    diplomatic relations with the German Democratic Republic in 1974, but that
                    relationship never developed much. On the other hand, our relationship with West
                    Germany was very close. We worked very closely in NATO and all international
                    fora. When Ronald Reagan took office there was the conflict over economic
                    policies and there were differences with Helmut Schmidt on dealing with the
                    Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>Most of our policy differences can be captured in the debate surrounding the West
                    European decision to build a gas pipeline from the Yamal peninsula in Siberia to
                    Western Europe. Under the Carter Administration in the Fall of 1980, we had
                    concerns about the impact of the pipeline on natural gas prices. I drafted a
                    briefing memo for Deputy Secretary Christopher's meeting with Deutsche Bank
                    spokesman Wilhelm Christians, which was very hard hitting. In fact, in 1986,
                    years later, I met him at a reception in Moscow and since this meeting was
                    contentious, I asked him about it. He recalled vividly the encounter, which
                    presaged what the Reagan Administration would later do for different
                    reasons.</p>
                <p>This gas pipeline project was viewed from the incoming Reagan Administration was
                    that the pipeline was inappropriate financial support for the Soviets (and
                    paralleled the debate in arms control). We argued that the pipeline would become
                    an export income earner for the Soviet Union, and would help them build their
                    military power and at the same time create a dangerous dependence on Soviet gas
                    by the West Europeans that could significantly change the political dynamics in
                    Western Europe against the United States. We staunchly opposed the pipeline,
                    however, were unable to find a quick common solution, or even a common approach
                    to this issue with the Western Europeans, particularly with the Germans.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>In the spring of 1981, shortly after Ronald Reagan had taken the office, we began
                    intense discussions with the Europeans, which eventually led to our
                    determination, for foreign policy reasons, to impose sanctions against European
                    companies which continued to trade with the Soviet Union. That decision also
                    affected American companies like General Electric which supplied gas turbines
                    that would run the gas pipelines, it affected Caterpillar that would supply the
                    pipeline equipment. Most damaging to our business relations was its affect on
                    West European companies. The reaction was fierce and centered on the
                    extra-territorial application of U.S. law. As a result Europeans sought
                    additional contract protection from such action or rejected contracts from
                    American companies. The effect of the law continues to date with the question of
                    Iran-Libya Sanctions Act and with extra-territorial application of U.S. law in
                    Iran and its oil exports.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this play in Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: The policy debate was a genuine disagreement about how to approach
                    the Soviet Union, a divergence from our policy of detente that the Germans
                    supported. The Reagan policy was seen as moving to what the Germans feverishly
                    sought to avoid, a confrontational approach. The Russians had deployed missiles,
                    SS20 missiles, which were intermediate-range nuclear missiles capable of
                    reaching Europe, but not the U.S. That threat changed the political-military
                    situation and was a Soviet effort to decouple the U.S. from Europe. The U.S. was
                    not threatened and theoretically could let the Europeans protect themselves. The
                    wedge policy pursued by the Soviets did wreak havoc on our relations. Our policy
                    was to confront these moves by the Soviet Union and not to help them
                    economically. The Europeans, particularly the Germans, moved to engage, to seek
                    detente, to seek compromise, to work with the Soviet Union, there was a growing
                    tension in our relationship. As a desk officer I was in the middle of these
                    policy debates, especially between the positions taken by Assistant Secretaries
                    Richard Perle, DoD, and Rick Burt, State.</p>
                <p>As important as the pipeline issue was to the German-American relationship and to
                    the tensions it caused, crucial decisions were not economic. They were still the
                    cold war security issues; the decisions to counter the SS20 deployments. Helmut
                    Schmidt, in a 1977 IISS speech, had asked during the Carter Administration to
                    take note of threatening Soviet missile deployments. The U.S. decision to deploy
                    the Neutron Bomb and President Carter's subsequent decision to not deploy became
                    a contentious debate about German confidence in American steadfastness in
                    defending Europe and was the backdrop for the Pershing Missile deployment as a
                    response to Soviet SS-20 missile deployments during Reagan Administration. In
                    the end we were steadfast and in 1983 we deployed Pershing Missiles in
                    Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From the vantage point of the German Affairs Office, how
                        was the Pershing Missile Deployment, which was the counter missile for the
                        SS20, seen? Was it seen as something that Germans would go along with or was
                        it seen as something that might would break them away from general agreement
                        with us?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: We had long arguments about the military effectiveness of these
                    missiles and their effect on detente. We had endless arguments about where war
                    would be fought, if the Soviet Union and the U.S. had weapons that would reach
                    Western Europe but not each other's homeland. Frankly, our concern was whether
                    the Germans in particular, and other Europeans, would allow us to deploy even if
                    we developed a missile to respond to the SS-20.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that our attitude towards the Germans was
                        more, I'm not sure it is the right word for it, more complacent, that the
                        Germans would be with us, as opposed to the French who seem to be wanting to
                        stick a burr under our saddle all the time? Did you find that it was hard,
                        and I'm talking about you in the Bureau, it was hard to make the powers of
                        be in the rest of our policy apparatus that Germany weren't somebody who
                        could be taken for granted?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: I recall two or three activities at that time that illustrate what
                    you are asking. One was a meeting with the head of the Deutsche Bank, Wilhelm
                    Christians, who came in to see Deputy Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, at
                    the end of the Carter Administration. As I noted earlier, we were talking about
                    this project of gas pipelines and what effect it would have on energy prices and
                    energy dependence. I had prepared the briefing memo for this very tough exchange
                    between the two principals and was quite taken with the tone of the exchange.
                    The atmosphere of mutual trust that I had seen among Americans and Germans in
                    Bremen, which was warm, reassuring, reinforcing dedicated to common goals seemed
                    to change to one of seemingly unreconcilable differences in policy and national
                    interest.</p>
                <p>Germany's national interest was to meet its need for energy and to reduce its
                    dependence on Middle East oil. After the oil shock of 1973 with its rationing
                    and driving-free Sundays in Germany, the German federal government had tried to
                    expand their nuclear energy sector, which created significant domestic political
                    problems. They tried to expand the use of coal and other fossil fuels, but were
                    trying not to overdo coal burning, because of environmental concerns. There was
                    an intense and growing German policy debate around the energy issue and we had
                    supported reducing dependence on Middle East Oil and on fossil fuels. The
                    Wilhelms-Christopher conversation had focused on the energy debate, in
                    particular on not forcing increases in natural gas prices by creating more
                    demand for Soviet gas. Their talk was not on the U.S. fear of increasing German
                    dependence on the Soviet Union.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>In the Reagan years we took a more confrontational approach toward our European
                    friends, leaving behind the more conciliatory approach. Consequently, there was
                    increasing tension in German-American relations. The debate shifted to an
                    anti-Soviet effort as we moved to the question how to deal with the Soviet Union
                    in the early days of the Reagan Administration. Larry Eagleburger was Assistant
                    Secretary for Europe and Alexander Haig was the Secretary. Both were very
                    sympathetic with our efforts to work out a common policy with the Europeans, but
                    found themselves confronted in the inter-agency debate with a policy of
                    sanctions to stop the Europeans from developing Soviet gas. The centerpiece of
                    the debate became the Germans plan to build a natural gas pipeline from the
                    Yamal peninsula in Russia to Western Europe. The Reagan Administration did not
                    want the Soviets to earn hard currency from the sales of natural gas with which
                    to fund its military machine nor to create Western European dependence on Soviet
                    gas and was determined to stop the pipeline.</p>
                <p>The German desk was caught in the middle and argued that the Western European
                    dependence on Soviet gas was not a threat. An economically strong Ally in West
                    Germany was a key pillar in our defense. We simply disagreed about the West
                    European view that the money the Soviets earned from gas sales would keep their
                    military strong. The West Europeans argued that the Soviets needed the money to
                    keep their economy going and their people satisfied. The political analysis to
                    back by the Administration's point of view overrode the political analysis in
                    the State Department. The Administration threatened the West Europeans with
                    foreign policy economic sanctions against their companies if the proceeded with
                    the sales of Mannesmann pipe, pipelaying equipment and gas turbines. Secretary
                    Haig argued against sanctions saying they would erode the support for the U.S.
                    among our allies. He lost the battle, sanctions were imposed, and he and ended
                    up being fired. From where I sat, I would say that his stand on the pipeline and
                    against sanctions pitted him against the anti-Soviet forces in our government
                    and was a significant contributing factor in his dismissal.</p>
                <p>There were sideline debates as well. Our fundamental concern with Berlin's
                    vulnerability as we remembered our responsibilities for Berlin and led us to
                    demand that the Germans create an underground reserve of natural gas for West
                    Berlin to avoid threats of a Soviet gas-cutoff for the Western sectors of the
                    city. In addition, I was asked to travel to Peoria, Illinois, on a State
                    Department outreach program. Peoria is the home of Caterpillar tractors, the
                    maker of pipelaying equipment such as that used for the Yamal pipeline. After
                    sanctions were imposed Komatsu pipelayers replaced Caterpillar and the Peorians
                    were hopping mad at the State Department for imposing sanctions. I met with
                    Caterpillar and with the local Illinois press to explain our position, but doubt
                    that I convinced any of those who had lost their jobs that we were on the right
                    side of the Cold War. They saw the sanctions as a failure and the replacement of
                    their pipelayers as a terribly costly policy to their interests. The greater
                    good is a hard sell.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Haig had been NATO Commander, and understood the
                        issues there as opposed to the early Reagan Administration which was a bunch
                        of people sort of posturing, who really didn't have that much knowledge of
                        foreign relations. Or am I simplifying?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: No, I think you have captured the conflict between the traditional
                    practical approach of Henry Cabot Lodge versus Wilsonian idealism. The Reagan
                    Administration came in with a view, with an ideal view of the world, Alexander
                    Haig came in with a very practical view and we were caught between the two
                    views. Obviously, those of us working in the trenches, or on the German desk,
                    were oriented more toward the practical Alexander Haig approach. We asked: how
                    do we work sanctions, how do we work it with the Europeans, how do we find a
                    common interest to seek out options for Secretary that were possible? The
                    example of the controversy over the construction of a gas pipeline from the
                    Yamal peninsula in Russia to Western Europe was an key debate for us. For the
                    last two decades this incident has shaped my own thinking on conflict resolution
                    even when we approach the same goals. Conflict or cooperation with the Germans
                    and the rest of the Europeans is a mixed bag of successes and failures.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: If the Soviet Union was the evil empire, the German Democratic
                    Republic was for many in the Reagan Administration the heart of the evil empire.
                    East Germany was a “closed society” and was very foreign to us, it was the worst
                    of the worst, they were constantly harassing us and that made life difficult; we
                    were ideologically opposed to almost all that they were doing. It was a very
                    cold and difficult relationship. We had just a few bilateral issues. From my
                    vantage point on the German desk - we had a special desk officer for East
                    Germany, Bruce Clark - the GDR was a plague on our house. On the economic side
                    there was the Leipzig Fair each year and that Fair was the extent of our
                    relationship; American companies attended, tried to make sales and had a
                    presence and then departed to return the following year.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: The East German economy had the reputation, not necessarily based on
                    analysis, but the reputation of being the best in the Soviet Bloc. It
                    functioned; it produced things; and it provided a certain standard of living,
                    which in East Germany, seemed to be higher than in the rest of the Soviet
                    Union.</p>

                        being somehow that, no matter, Germans are Germans, and they are really
                        efficient and they can do things. And yet, after the amalgamation of East
                        Germany into West Germany it's almost as all they had to junk everything in
                        East Germany and start all over again. Do you think we were over-evaluating
                        the ability of East Germany to produce?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Yes, we were over-evaluating, but in defense of those who tried to
                    figure out what a “closed society” was doing, there were intangibles that we
                    couldn't measure. First of all there were no public statistics, all the East
                    German information was contained in secret East German documents. We had to rely
                    on what we could observe, what we could see and to judge based on the products
                    that were exported. GDR products were clearly inferior but prices were lower. In
                    any case, they did sell and they sold a lot. They had a few areas were they were
                    actually technically and even technologically advanced. Even if some observers
                    ridiculed Erich Honecker's touting GDR advances like the “world's largest
                    microchip,” the GDR had some successes. I wouldn't say they were world
                    competitive, but they were advanced for the Soviet Bloc.On a later assignment in
                    the mid-1990s I met one of the engineers who had reverse-engineered an IBM 386
                    computer. He was very proud of that achievement that made the GDR the major
                    supplier of computer chips to the Soviet Bloc. Of course, they were constantly
                    behind the West. However, I would later find out what really mattered to the
                    real success of the GDR was its ability to do what we called during my time in
                    the U.S. Army: “field expediency.” They could make things work that shouldn't
                    have worked with just a little ingenuity and friends to help find parts. When
                    unification came that field expediency; that is, the personal network of
                    contacts, the use of products, the ingenuity that it took to make the economy
                    function disappeared. For analysts trying to determine what happened, there was
                    little or no tangible evidence that it ever existed. So our “Western” analysis
                    seemed totally wrong after unification. Well, we weren't totally wrong, but
                    there was no evidence that there was anything there that would support our
                    position that the East German economy was functioning. In fact, traditional
                    western analysis concluded that the East German economy did not and could not
                    work. Nevertheless, they did make and sell products. We came up with the theory
                    to explain what happened and decided that the GDR could last only so long as it
                    could draw on the capital and the plant equipment that existed from the last
                    century to the 1930s. When that capital was totally exhausted, the GDR would
                    collapse, and they were close such a collapse by the end of the 1980s. Economic
                    collapse, however, did not necessarily mean the political demise of the East
                    Germany, after all the Soviet Union lasted seven decades by use of military
                    force and internal terror.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the East German influence abroad? I mean one is
                        always hearing about East Germans being..., one of the great exports was
                        police expertise in the places like Lybia and other places, they seemed to
                        be as you say the “heart of the evil empire,” they seem to be able to export
                        this ability to control populace and all. Was this a concern of ours?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: East German sales of instruments of internal repression were a
                    concern. We of course had our own controls on police equipment exports.
                    Exporting instruments of communist and totalitarian state had always been a
                    problem and actually confronted us in several places, in Africa in particular,
                    with East German security types. But export license requests didn't play much of
                    the role for the Desk because GDR didn't play much of the role except a little
                    bit in trade. Berlin issues - the Four Power rights and responsibilities for
                    Berlin and Germany as a whole - dominated what the U.S.-GDR bilateral
                    relationship because they ran the sector checkpoints in Berlin for the Soviets.
                    On the other side of checkpoint Charlie they had their own checkpoint, they
                    harassed people, they required a minimum daily currency exchange; they didn't
                    let certain people in, they didn't let certain people out. That was the focus of
                    our relationship with the GDR in the context of our responsibilities to protect
                    the city of Berlin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the head of the Central European Affairs at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: At that time Tom Niles, and then after Tom left to replace
                    Eagleburger as assistant secretary, John Kornblum became country director.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Niles and Kornblum have... Was Germany high up on
                        theiaffairs or did they seem to be focused elsewhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Germany and Russia dominated everything they did. The office had one
                    officer who did Austria and Switzerland combined, one doing Berlin, one doing
                    East Germany. But really all the focus and attention that the two directors
                    spent was on the Federal Republic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the evaluation of Kohl that you can recall before
                        hactually became the Chancellor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Chancellor Kohl had always been underestimated and we shared that
                    view. Before he was elected he was a regional minister president, who had run
                    and not succeeded in becoming a candidate for chancellor. Franz Joseph Strauss
                    had run in 1980, but was defeated by Chancellor Helmut Schmidt. In contrast,
                    Schmidt was a towering figure for us and by contrast the later Chancellor Kohl
                    seemed to be a regional provincial governor. Helmut Schmidt was a strategic
                    thinker, economist, former Finance Minister, and internationalist. The contrast
                    between the two gentlemen was tremendous.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The dislike between Helmut Schmidt and Jimmy Carter,
                        particularly as the neutron bomb was part of what set this off. Schmidt
                        didn't trust Carter and thought that Carter as an undependable person. Was
                        Schmidt around when Reagan came in? Reagan of course not being the greatest
                        intellect in the world, and Schmidt being sort of world class intellectual,
                        how did that work from your perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: The contrast is remarkable. President Carter and Chancellor Schmidt
                    were never personally close. They had different lifestyles, they had different
                    approaches to policy and their personal chemistry never worked well. Schmidt
                    criticized Carter for making commitments and then not living up to them, which
                    for Germans is almost a sacred principle. Pacta Sunt Cervanta deal is a deais
                    part of their culture and political life, it's as close to being sacred as you
                    can be. Reagan was elected in November 1980; Helmut Schmidt came to Washington
                    shortly thereafter, ostensibly to meet with President Carter. A private meeting
                    with Reagan for Schmidt was made at Blair House. The meeting was private; there
                    was no press. President-elect Reagan and Schmidt exchanged views, treated each
                    other with respect, and began a very positive, cordial relationship at the
                    beginning of the Reagan presidency. The key question for Helmut Schmidt, and the
                    question for Ronald Reagan, was dealing with the intermediate range nuclear
                    missile threat posed by the Soviet Union. How to approach the Soviets, how to
                    deal with the same neutron bomb issue that torpedoed the Carter-Schmidt
                    relationship, how to counter the SS20 intermediate range nuclear missiles aimed
                    at Germany, or quite simply how do you deal with the Soviet threat? And while I
                    can't make the connection directly because I didn't see it, the outcome was a
                    common commitment: “We must respond.” As the policy conflicts between us however
                    arose, a distance began to grow between the two leaders over the pursuit of
                    confrontational or cooperative approaches to the Soviets.</p>
                <p>By the spring of 1981 when President Reagan named his Ambassador, Reagan looked
                    for someone who had a very close relationship with Helmut Schmidt. Dr. Arthur
                    Burns, who knew Helmut Schmidt as German Finance Minister, was very close to
                    Schmidt personally. There was in my view a concerted effort by the Reagan
                    Administration to reach out to Helmut Schmidt, to the Germans, to make sure that
                    that relationship worked because it was pivotal in the own efforts in Reagan's
                    policy toward the Soviet Union. The Reagan-Schmidt partnership lasted over a
                    year. As summer 1982 passed, Helmut Schmidt was increasingly under pressure and
                    then in September, 1982 he lost his standing in the Social Democrats. I attended
                    the SPD convention in Cologne when Schmidt and his handful of supporters were
                    isolated by Willy Brandt, Herbert Wehner and their supporters, dissidents in the
                    Social Democratic Party, who were opposed to the deployments of Pershing
                    Missiles to counter the Soviet SS-20s. That internal SPD fight over missile
                    deployments and another effort by his own Economics Minister, Otto Graf
                    Lambsdorf, a leader of the Free Democrats (FDP) to force a supply-side economic
                    policy “Angebotsorientierte Wirtschaftspolitik” on the SPD ended the SPD-FDP
                    coalition in October.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>When Chancellor Kohl took office that warm relationship between the Ambassador
                    Burns and Helmut Schmidt was an obstacle to Burns' relations with the new
                    Chancellor. In fact, while there was tremendous amount of respect for Burns by
                    Kohl, Kohl kept a distance to our esteemed Ambassador for some time, as they
                    worked through Kohl's resentment of the warm Burns-Schmidt relationship. By 1983
                    in the summer, when I left the desk for assignment in Germany, Arthur Burns had
                    become close to Helmut Kohl in policy terms, in terms of respect and in terms of
                    access, but not personally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get a feel for Reagan and Kohl?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Reagan and Kohl hit it off very nicely, very well. They both had a
                    sense of history, they both had a sense of destiny, knew here they wanted to go.
                    In summer of 1983, two years into the Reagan Administration, the debate over the
                    deployment of the Pershing Missiles had taken off, that had been very important
                    to their personal relationship and to the politics. President Reagan was
                    determined to respond to the Soviet Union and deploy the intermediate-range
                    nuclear Pershing missiles in Mutlangen. However, the political situation in
                    Germany had changed dramatically, the Greens had been elected in 1979 to the
                    Bremen Burgerschaft, the Parliament in Bremen. They moved to tremendous protest
                    against the atomic energy and the atomic weapons, and they combined the forces
                    of hundreds of thousands throughout the country.</p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: The switch to Kohl was almost seamless in terms of U.S.-German
                    relations. After Chancellor Kohl was elected by the Parliament in October 1982,
                    he had to stand for an election. However, Genscher's FDP, his new coalition
                    partner, had switched from the Social Democrats to Christian Democrats and their
                    ratings in the polls went down to two percent. An early election threatened them
                    with political extinction, if they failed to reach the five-percent hurdle to
                    get into the Bundestag. Consequently, Kohl moved elections from October to March
                    1983. From October to March there was a lot of uncertainty of whether the
                    Chancellor could be elected, how he would do it. I witnessed the election at the
                    ZDF television studio in Washington as Chancellor Kohl was elected and the Free
                    Democrats made the five-percent minimum to get into the Parliament and the
                    coalition was launched.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>Then, as soon as Kohl was elected, Pershing Missile deployment, which had split
                    the SPD in 1982 and undermined Chancellor Schmidt, faced Kohl. The U.S.-German
                    debate focused immediately on the issue: “To deploy or to not deploy.” In the
                    summer of 1983, I came to Germany as a Political Officer reporting on domestic
                    politics and was to follow the demonstrations against nuclear power and the
                    domestic debate on Pershing missiles. I attended all party conventions and the
                    German decision to deploy would determine the course of the Cold War. Deployment
                    became, in the fall of 1983, the policy issue that dominated all of us; it
                    wasn't certain that Chancellor Kohl could actually make the decision to deploy
                    and bring his party and the free Democrats to vote in order to deploy these
                    missiles in face of Social Democratic opposition led by Willy Brandt.</p>
                <p>In the fall there was a huge demonstration on the campus of University of Bonn,
                    300,000 or more demonstrators came and I joined them. Willy Brandt spoke to the
                    multitude and opposed U.S. Pershing deployments as too provocative of the
                    Soviets. There was a tremendous tension in the country as the SPD joined the
                    Greens in opposition to our missiles. In addition, there were constant
                    anti-nuclear demonstrations against spent fuel storage in Gorleben, in Lower
                    Saxony, the site promised to store nuclear waste, permanently and safely. There
                    had been demonstrations against nuclear power plants in which the border police,
                    in a military-like action with helicopters and armored personnel carriers, moved
                    against the demonstrators at Brockdorf in 1981. The tremendous buildup of street
                    power and growing uncertainty of whether the Green Movement, led by people I had
                    met while posted in Bremen - Petra Kelly, Otto Schily, Rudi Dutschke - combined
                    with Social Democrats, who were now in opposition, could block the Kohl
                    government Pershing Deployments.</p>

                    stayed on until 1985 and then Rick Burt came. He had been Assistant Secretary
                    who came out as Ambassador in 1985. So the last year was with Rick Burt.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Burns operate within the Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Bill Woessner was his Deputy Chief of Mission. Bill had been in Bonn
                    with Ambassador Walter Stoessel and Arthur Burns asked him to stay, and in fact,
                    he stayed total of six years to run the Embassy. Arthur Burns spent a lot of
                    time with the German senior politicians. He gave three or four major speeches a
                    year. He maintained close contact with President Reagan through an economic
                    advisory board that the President had. And really focused on discussion with
                    political leadership and also with students, and his public appearances.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We talked about it somewhat before from the Bremen
                        perspective, from the Bonn perspective, you are looking at internal

                        concerns about the protests? Was it just over the issue or did you see maybe
                        another force coming out of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Right. That's a very good point. There were at least two issues
                    beyond the specifics of deployment of missiles or nuclear weapons. One was the
                    role of the communist East Germans. Was there an outside effort to undermine
                    West German government? Yes, that was known. However, the more troubling was the
                    grassroots growth of citizens' initiatives that had been created and evolved
                    into the “Greens” Movement, which had become a political force by being elected
                    into State Parliaments. Now that movement was challenging. The movement had some
                    democratic legitimacy, that is, it had been elected to parliament, even though
                    it was borne of the 1968 extra- parliamentary opposition
                    (Ausserparliamentarishes OppositioAPO). The APO movement had swept through
                    Europe in 1968, was an anti-Vietnam War, anti-American movement, was
                    anti-military and anti-NATO, and appeared to culminate into a grassroots German
                    peace and pacifist movement that would have tremendous detrimental effect on
                    German democracy and Germany's relations with the United States. We thought this
                    grass-roots movement could certainly adversely effect attitudes in the German
                    body politic undermine more that just the deployment of the Pershing missiles,
                    particularly since its members were adamantly opposed to NATO; the even called
                    for a dissolution of NATO. Dissolution of NATO is in fact still in the Green
                    Party's platform today in 1998. These were fundamental issues. My job was to
                    find out just who are these people were and whether we could work with them. I
                    met them ofteformer General Gerd Bastian, Petra Kelly, Otto Schily, and Joschka
                    Fischer. I kept track of their policy thinking and tried to understand how they
                    were motivated, why they were so opposed to our policies. We reported on the
                    goals of these organizations and on the people. In fact, they were sincere in
                    their personal commitment to doing away with all things nuclear, whether their
                    opposition to nuclear power plants or nuclear medicine or nuclear whatever,
                    nuclear missiles in particular. There was a sense that none of the major
                    political parties cared about the environment, cared about the basis of life,
                    were only working for material goods. So you had a philosophical, ideological
                    and anti-democratic mix that found strong grass-roots support.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would imagine that at this time, and we were sort of
                        reaching again a major confrontation with the Reagan Administration, the
                        things were happening in Afghanistan and all, that there must have been a
                        great concern on our part that the Germans might be getting soft and if they
                        got soft that the whole thing would collapse on our side.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Exactly. We had seen the Carter Administration in 1979 begin to
                    change American views of the Soviet threat with the invasion of Afghanistan.
                    Carter proposed an increase in U.S. defense budget and the Reagan Administration
                    came in with a strong ideological, confrontational approach. The suggestion that
                    the Germans were going soft, that the Germans would not be able to stand up to
                    these kinds of confrontation we would pursue was a basic tenet of our approach.
                    There was of course, from the German perspective, reinforced by Carter's
                    decisions on the Neutron Bomb, that historically, and even in recent personal
                    experience by German policy makers, a question whether the U.S. would keep its
                    word. The French constantly played on this theme of American unreliability. The
                    French kept repeating that the Americans would leave Europe at some point and
                    you couldn't count on them forever. Of course, historically we didn't confront
                    the Russians and stop the building of the Berlin wall in 1961. That had a very
                    important impact on Willy Brandt's thinking about the limits of American
                    willingness to intervene in Europe. We had the neutron bomb decision, which we
                    have discussed. So there was enough uncertainty whether the U.S. would stick to
                    its decisions to give the argument credibility. In other words, both sides were
                    not certain how steadfast either would be in the face of a serious
                    confrontation. That's why all of the attention was focused then on the German
                    decision to deploy or not deploy the Pershing missiles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this play out?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: After the major Bonn anti-Pershing demonstration in the fall of 1983,
                    President Mitterrand came to the Bundestag and gave a speech in favor of
                    deployment. That was a very important signal for the Chancellor to say that the
                    French were with him. That Mitterrand speech emboldened Kohl to meet this
                    internal challenge by the demonstrators and pursue the deployments. The vote in
                    the Bundestag on the night of November 23, 1983 was dramatic. I went to the
                    Bundestag, but to get there I had to go through three police perimeters to get
                    past what's called the Bannmeile, literally the banned zone or prohibited zone
                    for demonstrations. The police had three of these interlocking fences that were
                    set up normally to control crowds at demonstrations. I moved through the
                    demonstrators to get into the Bundestag for this debate and the vote without
                    incident. As the debate moved to an emotional pitch, the Chancellor made his
                    arguments and in the end the vote passed. With our embassy trusted political
                    reporter, Richard Volk, we got word to Washington and there was a tremendous
                    sigh of relief in Washington that the Germans indeed decided to deploy the
                    missiles. It was the defining moment for the Chancellor of Germany, not only for
                    his relationship with President Reagan but also with Mitterrand and the French,
                    and his own population. Kohl was justifiably proud that that the vote was the
                    turning point for his own stature in his own country. It also signaled that the
                    arms race would move to confrontation, a confrontation that would end the Cold
                    War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our analysis that you were getting, where you
                        were,about the French who usually were the odd man out, were strong on
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: We were concerned that the French attitude would make them soft on
                    Russians as anyone else. There was a rather tense debate between the Germans and
                    the French at that time. The French had their own nuclear tactical weapons,
                    which were capable of reaching Germany, but not the Warsaw Pact countries. The
                    Germans were very uncomfortable with this idea. They needed to sort out their
                    relationship with the French. Germany as a non-nuclear power was never
                    comfortable even in the highest leadership positions with using or discussing or
                    engaging in nuclear war scenarios since the war would be played out in Germany.
                    They needed strong French support to convince them the U.S. would stay with
                    them. For the French, we understood that they too did not want to the Germans
                    moving closer to the East, away from that relationship with the French
                    themselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Germans acting as a buffer for the French and it
                        allowed the French to have a lot more room for free wheeling and suddenly to
                        discover that your buffer might be doing little free wheeling itself, it
                        just makes one nervous.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: If you just take the historical example, the French have delighted in
                    letting the Germans fight among themselves in German territory over the last
                    couple hundred years. In the Thirty Years War, the French played a very
                    important role in supporting the both sides in that conflict, but especially the
                    Protestants, and prolonged the conflict for their own national interest. In the
                    contemporary context, the Germans were very aware of the French need for Germany
                    to be the buffer against the Warsaw Pact, to be the frontline state, a
                    description they used themselves. Nevertheless, German steadfastness in NATO was
                    the very key element in the French support for West Germany; that is, divided
                    but with West Germany in NATO. But that French support didn't mean the
                    anti-deployment demonstrations in West Germany ended. Quite the opposite
                    happened. They intensified as the actual deployments came in Mutlangen,
                    Baden-Wuertemberg, a small military installation, was inundated with
                    demonstrators. Human chains linked hands of protestors for hundreds of miles
                    throughout the country and were taking place repeatedly. The American television
                    movie “The Day After,” depicting the world after the nuclear exchange, was shown
                    in the U.S. and was then translated into German. For the Germans, it was a
                    depiction of Germany the day after and was very upsetting, very emotional and
                    contributed to a very tense period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As it seems to do in England, there were some
                        demonstrators on, I don't know, some green something, there seem to be sort
                        of professional demonstrators, people who enjoyed demonstrations. Often
                        either young people it or middle aged women for whom this was seen to be the
                        way of life almost. Did you see a development of this type of person?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Certainly there were holdovers from the '68 revolution, as they liked
                    to describe it, who protested as a sort of profession. There were Easter
                    marches, there were gatherings and other parts of the movement that sustained
                    the effort to keep the protests alive. There were, I wouldn't say middle aged,
                    rather the older population, senior citizens who had experienced World War II,
                    who were very present and very insistent that we in particularly in the Reagan
                    years we were creating conditions for war. Those who experienced World War II
                    thought that we wanted to play out the Third World War in Germany and that the
                    Reagan Administration was too confrontational and dangerous. These attitudes
                    played well in the Social Democratic Party, in the senior citizens' group and
                    the '68 group. When these started to come together then you had also the younger
                    element of society that joined the Green Party. The Greens political movement
                    evolved into a political party, although they refused to call themselves a party
                    and tried to called themselves a movement. The Greens were elected into
                    Bundestag, a group but not a caucus represented in the Bundestag. Frankly after
                    all I had seen, we were fortunate that they had a legitimate political way to
                    exert political influence on decisions.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find these protest groups, as a political
                        officer, talking to various people in these movements, both in the Green
                        Party, Green Movement and outside of, but the protest movement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: For the most part, there were a few exceptions, but for the most part
                    they were extremely friendly to the U.S. They had very good feelings about the
                    people of the U.S. They liked what we were trying to do, they liked to visit,
                    and they enjoyed our lifestyle, however they had very specific objections to our
                    policies. The pacifists did not want the military used as an element of policy.
                    From their point of view they felt, they had a motto, “ Nie wieder Krieg vom
                    Deutschen Boden.” This was translated as, “Never again shall wars emanate from
                    German soil.” That motto is a very arrogant saying that means, if we Germans
                    don't start a war there won't be any. And you Americans are forcing us into
                    making war by demanding we station all your military people here, putting new
                    missiles on our soil and creating the conditions for war and that's very
                    dangerous. Joschka Fischer, for instance, grew up in Wiesbaden and used to tell
                    me that he simply considered that American soldiers, even those deployed in
                    Germany, as a part of the landscape. They belonged there, they were perfectly
                    welcome there, he just didn't like to use them in war. So the Greens did not
                    have a clear, acceptable picture of our role in Germany, but that also had very
                    mixed views on Americans. There were a few communists, who were adamantly
                    opposed to Americans, didn't want to have anything to do with us, but they were
                    very much a minority.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there in this group, and variations thereof, an
                        understanding of the Soviet Union and the Soviet system in the German
                        Democratic Republic and all, and understanding that maybe this could be an
                        either/or type of situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Their views of the Soviet Union and the GDR were romantic. The Greens
                    views were not based at all on realism or in terms of personal experience of
                    what the life was like there. Many of them had visited and were treated as VIPs
                    much better than they were treated in their own country, that is with respect
                    and with some interest in what they were thinking, so they had a very
                    romanticized and not very realistic view. Very few of them had gone to the GDR.
                    Petra Kelly led a demonstration for peace in East Berlin and was arrested, but
                    such efforts were few and not consequential in changing views in the Greens.</p>

                <p>BINDENAGEL: Not that I recall. These people were all West Germans, they were
                    committed West Germans. They saw West Germany as having its own identity, and
                    they saw East Germans as having their own identity. They were different

                        parties and movements, was there much feeling towards, we got united Germany
                        or was this something that just wasn't there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Not among these people. Among the opposition, Social democrats and
                    the Greens and other opposition groups there was not interest in pursuing a
                    unification policy. It was the government's officially declared policy. In the
                    Christian Democrats there was actually anger about the lack of a strong and
                    active U.S. position on unification. I recall 1983 coming to Germany, of meeting
                    Hans Veen at the Adenauer Foundation and being treated to a lecture on the lack
                    of U.S. activism on German reunification; He wanted to know why it was not at
                    the top of our agenda. I took the comments as a plea that if we did voice our
                    support, they could do so also. It was not, I thought, a real commitment to
                    German reunification as an achievable policy. There was, however, a sense
                    particularly among more conservative elements of the society, including
                    especially organizations from Czechoslovakia and Poland who had been former
                    German areas, Silesia and the Sudetenland. Those organizations played an
                    important role in the internal workings of Christian Democrats as a small but
                    important conservative constituency dedicated to keeping this issue alive. But
                    frankly, German unification was not on an active agenda. There was a goal, it
                    was an important statement, but active policy was designed to do things that
                    could be done to improve lives in GDR, which was really West German policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see, were this groups, the former Sudeten
                        Deutsche, the Polish group and the other ones, were they sort of a wasting

                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: The leaders were people who were actually expelled. They felt very
                    strongly and were very adamant. The generation that had made the transition was
                    less active but the third generation was almost as active and as vehement as the
                    first, expellees themselves. So you had this three-way mix.</p>

                        can't help but doing this looking at the neo-Nazis or whatever it might be
                        defined as, which apparently is a rather slippery definition. I mean it's
                        anybody who acts rather totalitarian I guess. Were you looking at neo-Nazis
                        and what were you seeing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Neo-Nazis in this period didn't play any significant role. They had
                    in the 1960s, and the Nationalist Party of Germany (NPD) had also been elected
                    to the Parliament.</p>

                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: The NPD had been elected on the right and the comparison with the
                    Greens on the left was always analyzed in the Hegelian dialectic. The West
                    Germans had the NPD in the 1960s and now they had the Greens. The Greens were
                    accused of being the communists as the NPD were called the fascists. The focus
                    of domestic politics with the Greens was to try to reduce the communists'
                    influence. The Social Democrats tried to reach out to the East Germans in a
                    formal political relationship, the SPD-SED Dialog, that was to confront the
                    Socialist Unity Party of the East German Communist Party with its own internal
                    contradictions. There was a series of efforts to deal with the communists that
                    led to accusations that the SPD was sympathetic to the communists, or what they
                    called socialist thinking. This was not the case with the conservatives and the
                    West German Neo-Nazis. The Neo-Nazi's played virtually no role. On the other
                    hand, leftist terrorists played a role through political assassinations,
                    especially the Red Army Fraction, RAF, was very active.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: RAF stands for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: The Red Army Fraction, an outgrowth of Baader-Meinhoff Group, those
                    were two individuals whose gang engaged in political terror and had grown out of
                    the 1968 APO, extra-parliamentary opposition movement. Those terrorist acts were
                    directed against U.S. military and killed several Americans as well as German
                    political and industrial leaders. The RAF assassinated prominent businessmen and
                    prominent German political leaders throughout this period. I arrived in Germany
                    in 1972, shortly after the RAF bombed the U.S. Officers' Club in Frankfurt, and
                    shortly before the September 5, 1972 attack on the Israeli athletes by the
                    Palestinians in Munich. I was in Bremen when Hans-Martin Schleyer was
                    assassinated and had just returned to Washington when Foreign Office Political
                    Director von Braunmuhl was shot outside his home. Many others were killed as
                    well. The last victim of the RAF was shot in his home in April 1991. He was Mr.
                    [Herold] Rohweder, head of the unified German Trust Agency that I had met while
                    was selling East German industry after unification. I learned of the
                    assassination during a Congressional Study Group on Germany Delegation meeting I
                    attended in Germany at the time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about how the Germans were treating their guest
                        workers?Was that a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Guestworkers in Germany was an issue. After the labor shortages that
                    brought them to Germany ended, the “guests,” mostly Turks and Yugoslavs decided
                    to stay and were in fact immigrants. The guestworker problem in the early 1980s
                    grew as unemployment rose and approached a million. Politicians looked for
                    something to encourage guestworkers to return home after one or two generations.
                    There were some incentive programs that were set up but there was never an
                    effort to force anyone out. The Nazi past weighed heavily on that political
                    debate and prevented expulsion, but there was an encouragement for them to
                    leave. The Germans stopped of course allowing new workers to immigrate. None of
                    those efforts worked, of course, because family members would join family
                    members and in case of Yugoslavia there was a significant population in Germany
                    already. By the time the Yugoslav republics broke up in 1991 German immigration
                    soared and the foreign-born German residents were eight percent of the
                    population, the same as the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about looking at the Universities at this period.
                        Lately there's been a lot of criticism from within Germany of the university
                        system, that it's big and doesn't produce very much.. Classes are too big,
                        many structural problems. Were we looking at the university system and
                        seeing what they were turning out, contrasting to how we did?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: We probably were having such a dialog, but it wasn't something that
                    came to my attention. The universities and the political debate on university
                    campuses were separate; they didn't occur in the same way it is occurring now.
                    The political debate over missiles took place on university campuses, but it was
                    not about the university. Those debates were volatile and could have led to
                    social unrest. If you go back to German history, social peace is the basis of
                    their social programs. It's not the safety net in our sense of the Great
                    Depression, it is one step beyond that, social conflict in German history,
                    including several revolution, is quite destructive. However disturbing the
                    universities' campuses were in the 1980s, they were protests of the political
                    agenda.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see the universities where traditionally, in many
                        countries you have the faculty that is sort of Marxist or semi-Marxist, and
                        they train each generation goes through almost their Marxist phase. I have a
                        daughter who has done this, coming out of a New England school. But you
                        know, then they leave and all of the sudden it's shocked them, and they
                        become solid conservative citizens. Where there universities playing this
                        thing then or was it different?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Certainly college preparatory gymnasiums had these teachers, one of
                    the extraparliamentary opposition goals was to march through the institutions
                    and to become teachers in the high schools and universities. They were doing
                    that. But the real revolution that took place in the universities was to have
                    open enrollment. In the 1970s the university administrations capitulated to the
                    APO demands, reduced entry requirements (except for numerous clausus majors) and
                    basically took everybody. So you diluted the ability of the professors to reach
                    out to students and created tremendous numbers of students. The government gave
                    a small stipend for students to help pay for cost of living. There was no
                    tuition and all who desired could go. And graduation rates slipped, that is time
                    in school spread out from eight semesters to 10, to 12,13, 14 semesters before
                    you graduated. The quality of education began to slip. While people recognized
                    the problem, had some debates about it, and cut the subsidies for students, real
                    reform never really came.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the economic system? You mentioned the economic
                        system, but I'm really thinking about the social welfare system. In Germany,
                        there always seemed to be so many rules and regulations about how society...
                        if you could open shops on Saturday, and that sort of thing. Did you see
                        this as important within the political context?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: That symbolic debate about store closing hours, the so-called
                    “Ladenschlussgesetz,” symbolized the debate about the rigidities in the German
                    economy, the need for order, and the translation of order into rules. The high
                    cost of labor, the high cost of fringe benefits and the unwillingness to hire
                    new people because you couldn't fire them made for serious rigidities. The
                    debate about the German economy, its rigidities, the options for solving
                    structural problems has gone on for years. The “Ladenschlussgesetz,” the Store
                    Closing Law, really was the focus. This law goes back a long way, but the debate
                    ran all the way to last year. You couldn't buy anything on Sunday. The stores
                    had to close at 6:30 in the evening and they had to close at 1 o'clock on
                    Saturdays. The whole concept behind that was of course that you have free
                    weekends and you spend time with your family, and it is a family friendly
                    operation. It also had the effect of protecting the small mom and pop stores,
                    and driving up prices. Recently the Ladenschlussgesetz was actually changed.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>If I can flash froward for a second, when I was in East Berlin in 1989 during the
                    revolution, there was in the Bundestag Ladenschlussgesetz debate in West
                    Germany, at the same time as the revolution in the East. So I would listen to
                    Radio Sender Freies Berlin, the radio station Free Berlin in West Berlin giving
                    the news report for an hour. For about two weeks I heard newscasters say
                    something like: “There was a demonstration in East Berlin on the Alexanderplatz;
                    the Stasi and the Volkspolizei moved in and cleared the demonstration.” Then
                    there would be a break and the next story would be: “In Bonn, the Bundestag is
                    debating the Store Closing Hours Law to determine whether or not the stores may
                    stay open on Thursday nights until 8 o'clock.” There you have proof that the two
                    Germanies were in two worlds. The West German world was going along fine; they
                    were doing okay even if the economy had its rigidities. They were bumping along
                    through the unemployment problem; they had changed the Government but not
                    changed the system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But during this '83-'86 period, looking at this seeing the
                        rigidity of the German system and all, which you say is really a form of
                        preventing a revolution more than anything, which is certainly an admirable
                        goal, looking at it now you had enough time in Germany so you could look at
                        it through disinterested but practical eyes and not as just an American
                        looking at this, did you think they were probably right for their particular
                        society to have their social rigidity?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Yes, they were certainly willing to pay a high price for social
                    peace. We as Americans are not willing to pay that price, but the Germans
                    certainly had every justification to do that. The question for them was whether
                    they needed to accept social instability. The unemployment rate in 1982 was a
                    million people and cost Chancellor Schmidt his government and brought Helmut
                    Kohl to power. Today the unemployment rate is over four million people. It's
                    12%. If unemployment has not caused social instability, then the question
                    becomes can the Germans still afford this kind of social safety net process they
                    have. It's a debate Germans are reluctant to take on because they have seen in
                    the meantime the revolution in the eastern part of the country. Although they
                    are not quite certain what happened in the revolution, they have seen the high
                    unemployment and are probably still willing to pay their price. We are not and
                    that will continue to be a conflict between our countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Somebody reading this in a decade or so might find the
                        completely reversal, but we are finding ourselves with the lowest
                        unemployment we've had at any time and we have open up our system so can
                        look at the German system, as you say it encourages unemployment because
                        nobody wants to hire because they don't want to get stuck with them. And you
                        have to pay hire rates, so it doesn't encourage the expansion of economy and
                        opportunities. It's a hard thing to fine tune.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: And frankly, because of the German proclivity to order and rules,
                    rules become more important than outcomes. If you follow the rules, you are safe
                    and fair, there are costs, but the outcomes are worth it. We, on the other hand,
                    are really concerned about the outcomes, we want to know how many new jobs we've
                    created, what kind of new things we are producing. The Germans, they seek to
                    insure that everybody is employed and those who are not working are taken care
                    of. And that's quite different, contrast in a way that two worlds approach these
                    kinds of issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see that following the debates and all within
                        Germany that there was a surplus of regulations about things over which
                        there was no need to be regulations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Absolutely. The anecdote of the day was that the neighbor either
                    wanted to remodel his house or to build a house. The whole focus of the
                    discussion was how many permits did you have to have to build a house. In the
                    U.S. you need one building permit, of course under that comes plumbing and all
                    those things, in Germany you need about 5000. You could start building
                    something, but it would take you forever to get started and then you need to
                    make sure that you get constant permits and so on. That was the point, the
                    vignette the people used to say: “We can't do this any longer.” But they
                    have.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A great number of young Germans go to the U.S. to get
                        education, our universities have quite a few Germans. Did you find this was
                        a group coming back and trying to kick things around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: No, they came back, found excellent employment. From American
                    universities they were well educated and could obtain good jobs, but for the
                    most part they did not play a role of activists. That has a lot to do too with
                    the political system. The political system is built on political parties.
                    Parties at the very local level chose who the candidates are, the candidates are
                    then put on the lists. You have two votes in Germany, you vote for the
                    individual and they are maybe 50 or 60 who are directly elected to Bundestag,
                    the rest are all voted by party slates. So you have a tremendous power over the
                    individual who may whish to come back and put his newly found experience to work
                    and change things. I used political parties as an example but the same thing
                    applies for other institutions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Bundestag members that you
                        talketo?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Because it is a parliamentary system, the Bundestag members are also
                    the government. And they are a very dedicated group of people, and very much
                    interested in being in the U.S. It was almost obligatory that Bundestag Member
                    who wanted to deal with any one of the issues, whatever it was, had to come to
                    the U.S. Whether it was science or security, they had to come and interact and
                    determine where Germany fit vis-a-vis the U.S. We were the base line, and they
                    would use us to judge where they were. The political parties at this point,
                    Social Democrats were in the U.S. all the time trying to find good arguments
                    against the deployment of weapons. When the Christian Democrats came to the U.S.
                    in the late 1970s and early 1980s, they had been in opposition long time and
                    came to learn about us Americans.</p>
                <p>One of the most important events that came out of this exchange of visits was in
                    May 1985 when President Reagan came to Germany on an official bilateral visit.
                    His visit became known as the “Bitburg Trip.” I was the site officer at the
                    Hambacher Schloss where a group of businessmen had staged a democratic protest
                    in 1832. I learned that Kohl raised the possibility of visiting the Bitburg
                    cemetery to commemorate the fallen soldiers in World War II as he had with
                    French President Mitterrand at Verdun. He apparently asked President Reagan to
                    come to Bitburg in November 1984 while visiting him in Washington. President
                    Reagan accepted Chancellor Kohl's request and the date was set for May 1985. We
                    began preparation for this very important visit probably January or February
                    1985. I don't remember exactly when Mike Deaver came out to do a visit to
                    various sites that Chancellor's office had proposed, but I went with him to the
                    Bitburg cemetery on a cold, wet and snowy day. We did not stay long, nor did we
                    notice the graves of the Waffen SS soldiers buried there. The events were
                    planned course for Kohl's home state of Rhineland-Pfalz, and included the
                    Bitburg military cemetery, which the Chancellor himself viewed as a very
                    important symbol of reconciliation for World War II. He had met with French
                    President Mitterrand at the cemetery at Verdun to help heal the wounds between
                    those two countries for the First World War. Kohl had hung in his office his
                    picture with Mitterrand, both stood holding hands overlooking the Verdun
                    cemetery. It is a very moving and thoughtful picture. However, the French
                    picture was taken 70 years after the war. In 1985 wasn't, only 40 years had
                    passed since World War II had ended. Instead of healing, the Bitburg visit
                    opened old wounds. Perhaps through a lack of knowledge, it was lost on the
                    planners that unlike Verdun where French and German soldiers were buried, there
                    was no comparable cemetery in Germany for Americans. Our wartime policy was not
                    to bury a single American soldier on the territory of Germany. We took all the
                    fallen soldiers and buried them in Luxembourg or Belgium or some place, but not
                    in Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was deliberate policy? I never really thought about
                        it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: The policy was deliberate. I first learned of the policy when in
                    Bremen a soldier who had stayed after World War II had died, and had a headstone
                    sent with the assistance of the consulate in Bremen. I learned that American
                    soldiers were entitled to a headstone and that it could be sent to Germany, but
                    there were no American cemeteries or American soldiers buried in Germany. Years
                    of good relations with the post-war Germans had also buried our memory of that
                    fact and obviously politicians were not aware of the policy. When we heard about
                    the cemetery at Bitburg, we visited it and found it a very dignified cemetery.
                    It has a little wall around it and the gravestones are flushed to the earth,
                    which would provide a nice ceremony where you could lay a wreath at the tablet
                    at the front. As was snowing, on the first trip with Mike Deaver, no one
                    examined the graves, except apparently, a couple of reporters, who brushed the
                    snow aside from one of these graves and found an “SS” marking on the grave. Once
                    that fact became known, all good intentions were thrown aside and the trip
                    became one of the most painful controversies we had in the German-American
                    relationship. No American president was going to lay a wreath on the graves of
                    the SS.</p>
                <p>The Embassy political section was charged with determining who was buried there
                    and what was going on. The Germans tried to reassure us that these graves were
                    not the hated SS, but soldiers, the “Waffen SS.” Robert Johnson, who was in the
                    Bonn group that dealt with the records of the Berlin Document Center and had
                    Nazi records, began to look through the 2000 so graves registrations to see who
                    these individuals were and what their units were, and to report back to the
                    White House. That the German soldiers were “Waffen SS” made no difference, they
                    were still Nazi deathhead SS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were basically drafted SS.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Right, but one cannot explain the difference to the American public
                    between Waffen SS and SS. I've been in Germany a long time, and I knew there was
                    no way that you could differentiate. Few of the soldiers' units were in question
                    and this was reported back to the White House. Bud McFarland was the National
                    Security Advisor, and Bud wrote to Horst Teltschik, who was Chancellor Kohl's
                    National Security Assistant and said: “Let's not go to Bitburg.”</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>After Horst Teltschik received this letter, Chancellor kohl saw what was
                    happening and made it a serious crises for German-American relations. The
                    Chancellor recognized that all the goodwill he had built up with the Pershing
                    Missile deployment and the steadfast commitment of President Reagan to Germany,
                    was at risk if Reagan did not go to Bitburg. Kohl feared that Reagan's rebuff of
                    a public commitment to visit Germany (and therefore Bitburg) would throw the
                    relationship back into the turmoil and risk his chancellorship. The Chancellor
                    then wrote to the President saying: “You must come.” George Schultz was
                    Secretary of State and was furious. In that letter Mr. Kohl had a sentence about
                    the political domestic rishe would no longer be chancelloiBitburg did not
                    happen. Kohl himself, having been elected only in 1983 and facing elections in
                    18 months, threatened that Bitburg would end his career. He portrayed the feared
                    rebuff as reneging on the commitments that the two of them had made, the
                    steadfastness of the relationship would fail; the Chancellor would be forced
                    from office.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>The President had to make the decision and we at the Embassy were asked to look
                    for other appropriate places to visit such as a concentration camp. I was
                    already assigned before that to prepare the visit to the castle at Hambach,
                    which was a scene in 1832 of a group of Germans demonstrating for democracy. A
                    revolutionary movement that was quickly defeated, I might add. I was asked to go
                    look for an appropriate site in the area to commemorate the victims of the
                    Holocaust. The city of Worms, which is a city with a thousand-year Jewish
                    history in Germany, was an alternative for the President. I went to the thousand
                    year-old Jewish cemetery and the synagogue and reported on the possibilities. At
                    the same time, Bob Johnson who had done work on the Bitburg graves went up to
                    the former concentration camp at the Bergen-Belsen. In the end President Reagan
                    agreed to visit the Bitburg cemetery, but he also decided to visit
                    Bergen-Belsen. So we had a compromise, but the Bitburg cemetery visit was an
                    irritant because any compromise except for the President not going to Bitburg
                    was not going to satisfactory to the American public. Adding Bergen-Belsen
                    changed the nature of the trip for the Chancellor from his hoped-for
                    reconciliation, nevertheless. The visit ended without serious incident, but was
                    not the glowing success Kohl had planned.There were a few anecdotes that
                    illustrate the kind of tension the Bitburg debate created among the advance team
                    and the embassy's organizing party. When President Reagan was picked up in Bonn
                    by his 150-car motorcade in Bonn to take him to a helipad, the motorcade left
                    downtown headed for the Rhine River Bridge. However, there are two helipads in
                    Bonn, one on each side of the Rhine River, and as the 150-car motorcade reached
                    the center of the bridge, the police escorts stopped and turned the entire
                    motorcade around in the middle of the bridge. The lead police car was going to
                    the wrong helipad. Mike Deaver, as this maneuver took place, got out of this car
                    and told George Schultz: “See the State Department can't do even a motorcade
                    right.” Shultz, I was told was steamed. The motorcade, or course, did pick up
                    the President and he went to Bitburg. The Bitburg wreath-laying ceremony was
                    dignified, but marred by the Waffen SS graves. Reagan went to the Bergen-Belsen
                    Concentration Camp Memorial, a sad reminder of man's inhumanity to man. My event
                    at Schloss Hambach was the last one on the trip. We had about 10,000 young
                    people, although we only planned on 5,000 young people coming to the castle. The
                    hillside was filled with cheering people as the President gave a very nice
                    speech, and the sun shone radiantly on him on an absolutely gorgeous day in the
                    Rhineland-Palatinate. Afterward, we had a conversation set up for the President
                    to meet a small group of students, and the President went back to talk to them.
                    He was having a very nice time with these young people, who were delighted to
                    meet the President. Although Mike Deaver at this point was very nervous because
                    the President was about half an hour late, Nancy Reagan, told Mike that he would
                    just have to wait. Nancy told him that Schloss Hambach was the best event of the
                    President's day, he was enjoying it, and King Juan Carlos who was the next on
                    the schedule would just have to be patient. She made sure the President was able
                    to enjoy the young Germans.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the German press playing up the Bitburg
                        business?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: One, as a conflict with the U.S., two, as the insensitivity of
                    Chancellor to Nazi history, and three, as Kohl's excuse for his own history; he
                    was criticized for his comment about his luck of the late birth - being born
                    late so he didn't serve as a Nazi. He was attacked roundly. A radio program
                    spoof, of a helicopter flying around over Bergen-Belsen and a lost President,
                    caused a great stir. There was a high tension throughout the whole visit. The
                    press was very harsh, and I assumed, although I don't recall what happened in
                    the U.S., I assume Bitburg was not well received here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it was certainly played up at. Were there any other
                        issueduring this '83 -'86 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Those are the real highlights. Ambassador Burns left in the summer of
                    1985, Rick Burt came in, we had many security issues such as the potential use
                    of chemical weapons and the Strategic Defense Initiative that played a role. The
                    conflict over chemical weapons was a key interest for Ambassador Burt, but
                    basically the relationship was on good standing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this, up through '86, was the “Soviet threat”
                        essentially over? I mean Soviets were there, but where you operating under
                        the idea that Soviets might invade at some point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: We still believed in the Cold War and international tension was very
                    high. If you recall, the President met in October of 1986, right after I left
                    Germany, in Reykjavik and proposed abolishing all nuclear weapons. There was the
                    tremendous tension. We still were confronting the Soviets around the world. SDI,
                    the Strategic Defense Initiative, had come into the debate. That dominated a lot
                    of what we were doing. The threat of missile attack was very real, the issue of
                    the window of vulnerability came, the whole question could we all seal off our
                    country from a nuclear attack. Now the nuclear threat was very much in evidence,
                    especially as we stationed new missiles in Germany. The walk-in-the-woods
                    debates, the arms control debates were dominant everywhere and we were deploying
                    new missiles. It was not a happy time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at it at that time, the Germans have the
                        reputation of not being the best of neighbors, I was wondering if looking at
                        Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, and particular problems around
                        there, have they learned sort of to keep there hands off, one might
                        say?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: The Germans' relations with the West were okay. The real complication
                    was the front line on the other side. Poland was constantly an issue. The
                    eastern border of Germany was not defined, because big portions of Poland were
                    actually Germany and you had the Soviet Oblast of Kaliningrad, which was
                    actually Konigsberg, East Prussia. The wind blowing from the East was a constant
                    undertone of doubts whether the Germans were trustworthy and good guys, whether
                    they still believed in the borders of 1937 or the borders of 1945. There weren't
                    any borders in 1945 because the Polish area was still under Soviet
                    administration technically, as was, is, Kaliningrad. There was an unresolved
                    issue about borders, coupled with the German expellee groups from Silesia and
                    the Sudetenland living in Germany. They played a small role in the electorate,
                    perhaps only two percent of the electorate, but when you have a narrow election
                    two percent is a very important part. The question of whether Germany could be
                    trusted or not focused less on the West and almost exclusively on the Polish
                    border. It wasn't even their border, it was the East German border, but
                    theoretically Germany was still Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much in the way of a relationship between West
                        Germanand East Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: There was an extensive network, a very extensive relationship was
                    built. West Germany even had a ministry for Inner-German Affairs. The West
                    Germans paid for a lot of improvement of highways and infrastructure. They
                    negotiated for the release of political prisoners, in which they bought freedom
                    for tens of thousands of East Germans. Honecker's lawyer, Wolfgang Vogel, was an
                    important player for both sides in that very unpleasant aspect of their
                    relationship. They also had economic relationship. They tried to have official
                    discussions and shortly after I left, in 1987, Honecker visited Bonn and was
                    received as a foreign leader. He also visited his home in the Saarland, West
                    Germany. So there was a relationship and they tried to ease the tensions of the
                    Cold War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we encouraging them or were we just letting them, as
                        far athis relationship is...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: We were trying to restrain them occasionally. We felt that this heart
                    of the evil empire really was the heart of the evil empire and we ought not to
                    do too many good things for the official East Germans. We fought against
                    increasing the vulnerability of Berlin. And their bilateral dialogue,
                    particularly the social democratic direct dialog with the East Germany communist
                    party was a concern to us. We were concerned, not what was happening in East
                    Germany, but rather what effects a warm relationship might have on West German
                    politics, especially on its role in NATO.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about the Ops Center. Could you explain how the
                        OpCenter worked and what you were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: The Ops Center is also known as the Watch, was just that. We had
                    three Senior Watch Officers and a team that rotated on two-day basis. Three
                    8-hour shifts would start off with an eight to four, four to midnight and
                    midnight to eight o'clock shifts. Moving two days at each one of those and then
                    two days off. When you stood watch, you dealt with problems or crises that
                    occurred, especially at night. We handled phone connections for senior officers,
                    deaths in families, hijackings and much more. When a Pan Am plane was hijacked
                    in Pakistan, we had to provide the initial reporting and establish contacts
                    between the pilot, the post and dozens of U.S. agencies until a task force was
                    set up to deal with the crisis.</p>
                <p>Of course, we saw a lot of sensitive messages being passed back and forth. At
                    that time the Iran-Contra debate was going on and Ollie North was ordering
                    operations which involved some special activities. Once he told us to recall and
                    destroy some cabled message and months later the investigation into his
                    activities sought it. With a bit of good fortune, we were able to find a copy
                    for the investigators. Basically hours on the watch were consumed watching CNN,
                    checking the wire service tickers - we had running tickers all the time -
                    monitoring cable traffic from posts abroad, acting as telephone operator. We
                    were always looking for issues that would alert the Secretary to events that he
                    would have to deal with in the next day. We worked closely with the INR Watch to
                    prepare the “Morning Summary,” which was an overnight report for the
                    Secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any things hit you while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: The hijacking of Pan Am plane in Pakistan was a high moment, and
                    dealing with some of the issues in Iran-Contra were also extremely interesting,
                    if troubling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you feeling any sort of political pressure or were
                        you sorof passing the hot potato on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: We were passing hot potatoes, dealing with the issues only in the
                    sense of holding them long enough to get them to the responsible people. We had
                    no action responsibility other then to make sure that the connections are
                    made.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Something I didn't ask you about Germany that has just
                        occurred to me. Did you get involved at all with the both the bombing in
                        Libya and the aftermath of the nightclub in Berlin? Did that happen on your
                        watch?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Yes, the La Belle Disco bombing did take place in West Berlin,
                    killing a few people. That incident was traced to Libya and was handled directly
                    by West Berlin. I did later actually deal with the investigation in East Berlin
                    when I was DCM and sought East German Interior Ministry cooperation and then
                    later as charg� in Bonn when the judge demanded our evidence, but not as the
                    bombing occurred.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the bombing in Libya, how was that viewed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: The bombing of Libya was also on our watch. The reaction in Germany
                    was two-fold. One, a horrible thing that we have done, how can you just bomb out
                    of a blue like cowboys in the Wild West, and the second, was a stern reminder
                    from the Germans to remember the “Stauffenberg” lesson, a reference to the
                    failed Count Stauffenberg plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler. “If you're going to
                    kill him, make it work,” they told us. There was a lot of concern after the
                    Libyan bombing about our own security in the Embassy. Several measures were
                    taken to beef up the physical security, including the construction of
                    checkpoints in the housing area and armed police patrols near the school. Before
                    the bombing Washington did consult with the Germans by sending General Walters
                    to brief them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left the Ops Center, you were Congressional
                        Fellow from '87-'88. Who was Lee Hamilton?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Lee Hamilton was the Congressional representative from the Ninth
                    District in Indiana and was second ranking Member on the House Foreign Affairs
                    Committee, as it was called at the time. I was American Political Science
                    Association Congressional Fellow, which began with a two-month course at Johns
                    Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies, and then I joined Lee
                    Hamilton's staff. The whole point of this was to learn how Congress worked. We
                    had a range of assignments from constituent mail to preparations for meetings,
                    for speeches and working with the HFAC Committee staff. In December 1987, Lee
                    asked if I would work with Jed Johnson, the Executive Director of the Former
                    Members of Congress to create a “Congressional Study Group on Germany.” We
                    drafted up some goals and objectives and Lee sent a “Dear colleagues” letter,
                    inviting Members to join. We organized the first meeting of the Bundestag
                    Agriculture Committee and the House Agriculture Committee and hosted a day and
                    a-half meeting with Chairman Kika de la Garza and a German Bundestag delegation
                    from the Agriculture committee. I took the group out to St. Louis where they
                    visited Monsanto and to the University of California, Davis as well as other
                    places. I enjoyed learning something about agriculture and the politics of
                    agriculture. The fellowship culminated at the end of the year with a visit over
                    the 4th of July to Congressman Hamilton's district where I could see how
                    Congressman worked in his constituency. At that point my connections in the
                    Operations Center helped as the USS Stark was attacked; I set up several calls
                    through the Operations Center for the Congressman to be briefed on developments
                    in preparation for a TV appearance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the American destroyer in the Persian Gulf
                        attacked by aIraqi plane, although we were sort of on the side of Iraq at
                        the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Right. Acting quickly, I got on the phone with the operations center.
                    I was debriefed and was able to give Lee an update on the attack. We were later
                    connected with the Near East Asia Bureau in the State Department and Lee was
                    able to prepare for his public appearances. Lee was invited to join a morning
                    talk show and speak on the Congressional view of the attack and the U.S.
                    response. You can see the value of Foreign Service experience working with a
                    Congressman and on a fast breaking issue. It was really a delightful year, and
                    one that every Foreign Service Officer should have an opportunity to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you get out of this exposure of Congressional
                        view poinof foreign affairs, that you maybe carried over with you later
                        on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: The real value of being there was to see how the political
                    interaction among their constituents' concerns and foreign policy. Working in
                    the House of Representatives, we were really dealing directly with the
                    constituency and relate the concerns of the constituency to foreign policy.
                    Surprisingly, there were ways to communicate, to understand and to connect. Of
                    course, working with Lee Hamilton who is a real professional both in foreign
                    policy and as a Member of Congress, gave me a tremendous insight in how to
                    communicate and to see the politics as it affects the policy.</p>
                <p>Over the last 15 years since then, I've used and built on that experience to
                    develop personal contacts with Members of Congress, especially in the
                    Congressional Study Group on Germany, to encourage closer international
                    cooperation with their districts. For instance, I have pointed out that foreign
                    direct investments in their districts are not foreign but rather another
                    constituency in their districts. Robert Wise, the representative from West
                    Virginia (and now Governor of West Virginia) is a case in point. West Virginia
                    has a large investment by a German company, BASF, and we arranged a
                    Congressional visit to the BASF central headquarters in Mannheim, where he met
                    with the CEO, talked to him about his West Virginia operations as well as trade,
                    investment, and environmental issues. This chemical company is a “West Virginia”
                    constituent and from that encounter, a year and a half ago, they've had several
                    more meetings. The connection between the foreign policy and Germany was
                    important when it becomes a constituent concern of this Congressman. Bob Wise
                    has been active in foreign policy since then. I really learned a lot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then in '88, where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: In '88 I went to Canadian desk for very short time, from summer of
                    '88 till March of '89. There I was the Deputy and then as Acting Director of
                    Canadian Affairs, where we worked on the Permanent Joint Board of Defense. It's
                    a cooperative defense effort that had been started in World War II with the
                    Canadians and covers a whole range of security issues. During that period the
                    U.S. held elections and in February 1989 President Bush made his first visit as
                    President to Canada. There were other meetings as well as for Secretary Shultz
                    with his counterpart, Minister of External Affairs Joe Clark.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were defense issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: For the most part we concentrated on cooperative training exercises
                    with the Canadian Navy, Canadian Land Forces. We went to Goose Bay to review
                    NATO air force training up there. Of course, through process our good Canadian
                    friends gave us a few history lessons, explaining the importance of the
                    Revolutionary War in defining the Canadian identity, especially the U.S.
                    invasion of Canada.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are talking about the 1776 war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Right, the 1776 war when we invaded them, and how we captured them
                    and mistreated them and how after all they would never forget this historic role
                    of the United States. I was well in-tune by the end of this assignment to the
                    importance of our leading principles of “life, liberty and the pursuit of
                    happiness” from the Declaration of Independence and the differing Canadian
                    Weltblick o“peace, order and good government” that comes from their
                    Constitution. While both very democratic, the differences separate the two of
                    us. One note of humor. When we had an Army tank maneuver exercise in New York,
                    the Canadians protested because we had not notified them as required. They asked
                    whether we were planning to invade then! A little overblown, but we were
                    required to notify them because it was near their border but the point was
                    political and respect was demanded.</p>
                <p>Then we had another issue of rights of international passage under the ice cap
                    under the North Pole, which we were testing because of the Soviet Union on the
                    other side. We had submarines that could go under the cap, but the Canadians
                    considered these waters Canadian national territory and demanded that we notify
                    them and get their permission for passage. We refused to recognize the passage
                    as Canadian territory, but we did work out a notification system. While we would
                    tell the Canadians when the U.S. Navy was transiting, they would acknowledge the
                    notification. We were not asking permission and they were not blocking passage.
                    It was a reasonable accommodation. On the economic side at that point the
                    Canadian Free Trade Agreement had been negotiated, there was an election in the
                    fall if 1988 in Canada. After that election the new Government ratified the
                    Canadian Free Trade Agreement and we began the implementation. That was in
                    December and we began implementation in January 1989.</p>
                <p>There were a lot of activities and a lot of very interesting issues. Probably the
                    greatest number of issues with Canadians was demonstrated in the meetings with
                    Minister of External Affairs Joe Clark and Secretary George Shultz. We had a
                    briefing book that we had 50 or so different issues. It was a very complicated
                    relationship, but when the Secretary got to the “Porcupine River Caribou Herd”
                    migration across the Alaskan tundra, even the usually hard-headed Secretary had
                    to chuckle. The image of porcupine caribou was a good one [laughter]. There were
                    a lot of serious issues with Canada, and it is a very important relationship for
                    us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the Canadian desk, I hesitate to ask this question d we
                        have a secret file or something, but do we have a secret file or something
                        that says “In case Quebec becomes independent, this is what we do?” Or is
                        this just one of these things... This is an issue that keeps coming up, and
                        we know the sensitivity of the Canadians. Or is this something that you
                        can't even talk about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: During my time the Canadians had a debate on the Meech Lake Accord
                    which was to resolve this double nation issue, and it failed by one vote from a
                    Native Canadian. Our whole approach was to treat this sensitive question as a
                    domestic Canadian issue, which we kept our hands off. Only they could decide
                    their fate, and we wanted to respect their sovereignty. And no, we have no
                    secret files, no preparations, no speculation as to what States might join or
                    not join the U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We have a policy of no policy absolutely?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: We respect their sovereignty, and since they joineBritish North
                    America in 1776 they are okay. [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we find that there were attempts of Qu�b�cois to
                        establistheir own lines to the U.S.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Yes, the Qu�b�cois, as they like to call themselves, always thought
                    that Qu�b�cois was more appropriate one...[laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think that Quebecker would be a pejorative term? I
                        meain English it sounds that way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Sounds funny.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But anyway.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: When the Quebec government had tried before to establish an office in
                    Washington, the State Department told them: “No.” They tried again during my
                    time to have a trade office during my time and were told that it would not be
                    appropriate; they were represented by their national government. They were very
                    active culturally, and tried to establish cultural office connection. I don't
                    know if that actually came to fruition. Again, I was made aware of the
                    sensitivity of that issue, when I met with Jacques Pariseau, the opposition
                    leader, who defended of Quebec independence. I had to explain what the meeting
                    was about to calm unwarranted concerns. The explanation was no problem, it was
                    appropriate, but the meeting was very sensitive.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting this “Why don't you pay more attention to

                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: We always got that sense that we were ignoring them. There was “Why
                    can't we have not only Deputy Assistant Secretary in the State Department taking
                    care of us? We need somebody in the White House, we need an Ambassador who can
                    access the President on the daily basis and bring the issues of the IJC, the
                    International Joint Commission that deals with the border issues directly to the
                    President every day.” Sometimes when we got really frustrated we would ask that
                    they stop whining. But that's really all. They wanted, and deserved a lot of
                    attention, They got it, but Canada never seized as much as attention in the U.S.
                    as we did in Canada.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find any problems with the fact that sort of the
                        Governors of the Provinces and the States? I mean there are all these
                        connections on the border and all, that really bypass the State Department,
                        between say Vermont and Quebec, or what have you, Dakotas and Saskatchewan,
                        did this in true cause problems or where you just thankful that someone else
                        was taking care of the problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: The relationship was so complicated and there were so many actors
                    that it was very hard to track. What we have in the Embassy in Ottawa are
                    representatives of almost all our Federal Agencies, they must number over 40. We
                    had institutional arrangements we the International Joint Commission to deal
                    with issues that had governors and provincial leaders engaged. The other
                    divisive issue that we had at that time was Acid Rain Agreement. We picked and
                    chose those issues that we could deal handle and put the rest of the issues into
                    joint commissions where the U.S. governors played extremely important role.
                    While there may have been tension at some times, most issues were too
                    complicated that they were too much to take on. The relationship was just too
                    complicated. Salmon wars, fishing rights over salmon on the West Coast, continue
                    to the day, they were always out there. That fishing dispute is really a border
                    dispute where our borders come in at an angle, if you draw the line out you find
                    out that there is a disputed water with us, who gets what fish there. That one
                    will be very hard to resolve.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fish wars have... John Quincy Adams was dealing with the

                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: The Canadians had a confrontation with Portuguese fishermen off their
                    coast and they had a couple of inspectors board a Portuguese ship (I think it
                    was Portuguese), which took them back to Portugal! The Canadians did not think
                    highly of that act of kidnaping and armed their patrol ships with 50 caliber
                    machine guns for the first time. I recall that they actually did fire them once
                    across the bow of a fishing ship, so there were other concerns.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: He did get on very well with both. When Mulroney came to Washington
                    at one point he spoke to a joint session of Congress. He was delightful, funny,
                    very pleasant and at the end of his speech he switched from his fluent English
                    to fluent French, much to the consternation of the joint members of the Congress
                    who were sitting there. At the end he said “You will pardon me for speaking in
                    French but I wanted to speak to my constituencies in Louisiana and in Quebec.”
                    [laughter] I am not sure whether Louisiana Congressmen appreciated it, but there
                    was laughter in the House Chambers.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Right, but to the “other” (East) Germany. In 1989 I went to East
                    Berlin. Ambassador Richard “Dick” Barkley, who had been my political counselor
                    at Embassy Bonn asked if I would be his Deputy Chief of Mission. I was
                    delighted. I had to leave the Canadian Desk early, but I Assistant Secretary Roz
                    Ridgway approved and I was able to depart. We arrived in East Berlin on March
                    20, 1989.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You stayed there how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: We left in November 1990, after German unification abolished the GDR
                    and we closed our embassy. However, in March of 1989 the Communist Government of
                    East Germany was still well entrenched, Erich Honecker was the Chairman of the
                    Council of State (Staatsratsvorsitzender).</p>
                <p>Soon after we arrived, I took my family to downtown East Berlin. My daughter,
                    Annamarie, was eight years old at that time, and my son, Carl, was six. We went
                    down to see the Berlin Wall from the eastern side of the Brandenburg Gate. Jean,
                    my wife, my two kids and I were standing there trying to tell just what this
                    Wall was. The Brandenburg Gate towered over the empty squarPariser Platz. The
                    sun was coming out from behind the ubiquitous clouds; it was absolutely gorgeous
                    day. My daughter spotted a group of people standing on risers on the western
                    side of the wall, peering across the Brandenburg Gate and looking our way. I
                    recall she said: “What are they doing?” And I replied: “They are looking at us,
                    we are a curiosity, we are like prisoners behind a wall. And they look at us,
                    they know people here are not free.” Of course we were diplomats and we could
                    leave, but East Germans weren't. The kids were fascinated with the idea that we
                    were among the prisoners.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>We joined Maria Magdalena church in our Pankow neighborhood just down the street
                    from our home at Platanenstrasse 93. Shortly after we joined the parish, first
                    communion was celebrated and there were six or seven kids taking their first
                    communion. A couple of the children were our children's age and the four struck
                    up a friendship. Our two asked the others how they felt about being prisoners.
                    They explored the East Germans' reasons for attending church, which they learned
                    was tolerated but discouraged by the government. The kids who were confirmed in
                    the Christian Church were taking not only vow for their Christian beliefs but
                    they were also taking a vow that would exclude them from high school, exclude
                    them from good jobs, university and certain careers. Christians were
                    discriminated against by the communist government, which would not let them go
                    to higher education, unless for some other reason, they had other connections.
                    Our children were becoming politically aware as they explored this “communist”
                    life that their new friends had.</p>
                <p>Our children also played with another group of East German neighborhood children,
                    who were not in the church. They played together until the Father came home,
                    discovered our children in his apartment and demanded to know whose children
                    they were. When he found out they were Americans he was extremely nervous
                    because he could lose his job or be imprisoned for contacts with Westerners. Our
                    kids left and we did not see the other two children until about two years later
                    when we were leaving. They were still in the neighborhood, but obviously the
                    Father was very concerned about being accused of connections with Americans.
                    Those penalties imposed by the communists had a chilling effect that let a
                    strong impression on all of us. That was our introduction as a family to this
                    place of the communist paradise.</p>
                <p>In addition, in front of our house we had People's Policeman (Volkspolizist), who
                    patrolled the block to check on our visitors. We also had a Schwarze Pumpe gas
                    company man, who came into the house each day to check to see if the gas was
                    working. Of course we recognized that the telephones were bugged and that we
                    were occasionally being trailed. It wasn't funny, but it was strange. We tried
                    to accommodate ourselves to be aware of this new security context and how it
                    affected our lives. We had a cook and a couple of household staff, all of whom
                    either reported to the East German State Security, the Stasi, or were informal
                    co-workers of the secret police. We were well covered in every aspect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this period events started to take over, but around
                        thatime when you arrived, the GDR was unchangeable, was it solid?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: That was the conventional wisdom. If the Soviet Union was the “Evil
                    Empire,” the GDR was its heart. Reagan may have made some new openings as he did
                    in June 1987 when he challenged Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall, but the
                    view that East Germany was evil was still potent. Nevertheless, between Reagan's
                    confrontation and Gorbachev's Glasnost and Perestroika, there was something in
                    the air. Gorbachev had proposed restructuring the Soviet economy, Perestroika,
                    and creating more openness in the society, Glasnost. I recall he gave a speech
                    at the UN General Assembly, I don't remember the date exactly, comparing himself
                    to Franklin Roosevelt. He praised Franklin Roosevelt for the reforms that he had
                    made during the Great Depression that saved capitalism, and Gorbachev envisioned
                    himself doing the same for communism. He would make this great reform and the
                    socialist state would continue, reformed but it would last forever. Well, those
                    two policies were opposed adamantly by Erich Honecker, who believed quite the
                    opposite. If you began this process you would never maintain control, Honecker
                    maintained and he defied Gorbachev. This defiance was done at great risk because
                    the GDR was totally dependent on Gorbachev; in true sense it was a satellite of
                    the Soviet Union. East Germany had no political legitimacy from its people; it
                    was dependent on the military support of the Russians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about... There was an Embassy at this point.
                        Who wathe Ambassador, and where were you located and how did you
                        operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: The Embassy was on Neuestatische Kirchstrasse, two blocks North and
                    East from the Brandenburg Gate, just around the corner from the Soviet Embassy,
                    which was on Unter den Linden in sight of the Brandenburg Gate. The American
                    Ambassador was Richard Barkley, I was DCM and Jon Greenwald was the Political
                    Counselor. Reno Harnish was the Economics Officer and was later replaced by Mike
                    Mozur. We had those six Foreign Service Officers and were a very small
                    operation. Mary Rose Brandt was the Consular Officer, Gerry Werner was the
                    Public Affairs Officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived there, how did we deal with the GDR
                        government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: The Ambassador met with the members of the Politburo on an irregular
                    basis. Jon Greenwald in the Political Section met with the Ministry of Foreign
                    Affairs America Section that dealt with relations with the U.S. Beyond that
                    there was very little official contact. We dealt with the dissidents and the
                    church and we had a person, Emre Lipping, who was in charge of that portfolio
                    and attended church meetings and gatherings of dissidents. The GDR even had
                    officials, including State Secretary Gysi, in charge of church affairs. However,
                    for us the GDR remained a “closed” society with little possibility for
                    contacts.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Very much the same thing. The German Permanent Representative from
                    West Germany was doing somewhat different things; they were more deeply engaged
                    in trying to find out what the society was doing. They also had many more
                    resources and access because they were spending a lot of money in GDR.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time were we not trying to open up and spend
                        mormoney, I mean, was this time almost a watching brief would you say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: It was very much a watching brief. We had Leipzig fair, which was
                    still our main bilateral activity. We did have lot of commercial contacts with
                    the East Germans. We had a congressional delegation that came in March shortly
                    after I got there, headed by John LaFalce from Buffalo, New York. They had a
                    good round of talks. We met with Egon Krenz, who was Honecker's deputy,
                    Congressmen LaFalce met with several bankers and other kinds of economic people,
                    we had some consular issues but they were very individualistic. Politically, we
                    had dialogue on CSCE because they were a part of that process. But otherwise, we
                    were more interested in what they were doing domestically. How would Honecker
                    react to Gorbachev's moves? The SED, communist party, was planning a party
                    convention in 1990; we thought there would be perhaps a leadership change in
                    GDR. After President Bush had come into office in January, we had gone through a
                    policy review regarding East Germany. In our deliberations, Jon Greenwald
                    proposed the basic theme: “If the GDR would to change their policy and
                    leadership perhaps then we could make some kind of opening to them.” What could
                    we do? We could intensify our trade relations, we could be more actively engaged
                    with them on CSCE.” That was our thinking in spring on 1989. These policy
                    reviews were called in Washington “status quo plus.” We weren't talking about
                    any initiatives, or any other new policies with the GDR.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our view of Honecker?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: We really didn't like the East German communist leader Erich
                    Honecker. Honecker sought an invitation to the United States and had sent one of
                    his ideologists, Otto Reinhold to Washington in 1988 when I was on the Canadian
                    Desk. Reinhold was followed by Herman Axen, his foreign policy guru. Honecker
                    badly wanted to have a visit with us to gain some legitimacy for his regime. We
                    frankly had policy debates over whether we wanted anything to do with them. We
                    demanded that they rescind thei“shot to kill” order at the Berlin Wall, and to
                    abolish minimum currency exchange requirements so that there would me more free
                    flow of people, and a whole series of other policies. The Washington Post came
                    out in the spring of '89 and had an interview with Honecker, which was his
                    effort to go to Washington. He had been to Paris, he had been to Bonn, he was
                    going to Holland, so the crowning event of his life and the legitimacy, was to
                    go to the U.S. We just weren't interested.</p>

                <p>BINDENAGEL: Getting out and around was no problem for us. We were not under any
                    restrictions for meeting people so Ambassador Barkley was out a lot, had plant
                    visits and talked to local leaders and things. John Greenwald as well. As a
                    traditional DCM, I stayed in Berlin most of the time myself running the
                    operation, trying to give some coherence to what we were producing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about life there? Shopping, and that sort of thing at
                        thatime? Meeting with the local people, shopkeepers, etc.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: East Berlin was a difficult place for American diplomats. In the
                    first instance, the contact with East Germans was very limited. We had contact
                    in our church and a few people from there are our veterinarian, a few people in
                    the neighborhood who were curious but very leery, shop keepers are all
                    communists, there is no contact there. The shopping itself in the GDR was pretty
                    abysmal, particularly since we had access to West Berlin. But living in East
                    Berlin and trying to contact people in East Berlin and then going to Ku'dam in
                    West Berlin, and seeing this opulence and this wonderful success story of
                    western society, made it very difficult to go back. Our colleagues in West
                    Berlin, who were in the “Occupation” housing, lived in rather large houses, had
                    all kinds of creature comforts of home, and a very nice lifestyle. In some
                    sense, they took on the attributes of those who were the wealthy cousins and we
                    were the poor cousins, living in the poor section of Berlin. There was a tension
                    that existed between the two missions. You could say that we were tainted by our
                    association with the communists. I would argue, although I can't prove it, that
                    assignment to East Berlin had a negative affect on people's assignments in the
                    bureau and on their careers afterward. The tension was such that many of us
                    preferred not to go to West Berlin, only for some specific “Western” shopping or
                    dining need.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>I met regularly in West Berlin with the Minister from the German Permanent
                    Representation Office, Joerg von Studnitz, and our French and British
                    counterparts. We shared our conversations and exchanged notes on a regular basis
                    on the developing revolution in the GDR. We sensed that that was the most
                    important contribution that we could make, was by living there and whatever
                    contact, limited as it was that we had, it was still more than anyone else had,
                    and we could make that contribution to judgements.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Will you tell about developments? We're talking about
                        withimonths while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Right. The process of political deterioration began to accelerate at
                    the time that we came. Not that there is any cause and effect, we just showed
                    up. The first event that became for us significant was the May 7 local
                    elections. They had community elections on that day. I was very curious of how
                    this would work. I was invited the night before the election by Walter
                    Andruczyn, who was visiting East Berlin. He had served in East Berlin before and
                    he had invited me to meet Thomas Krueger, a young East German who had put
                    together some people to do poll watching at various districts the next day
                    during this communal election in Berlin. What the Krueger group wanted to do was
                    to cover enough of the polls to enable them at the end of the day when the local
                    polls closed to confirm the numbers given by the authorities. No one doubted the
                    outcome for the GDR “National List.” When the poll watchers finished collecting
                    all these numbers and compared them with what the official results were in the
                    newspaper the next day, trouble began. I though it seemed rather reasonable
                    democratic action, but this was a totalitarian system and challenging or
                    checking on the government was a rather risky thing to do. But it was a
                    fascinating night, listening to these stories to these young people.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>I was so curious that the next day after church I said to my family: “Well let's
                    go down to our polling place, and let's see what this election is all about.” So
                    we traipsed down to Blumenthalstrasse, the kindergarten that had been converted
                    for the day into a polling place, walked in the door, Jean kind of looked
                    around, kind of, “We're here, can we do this?” “Oh, sure:” I replied and we went
                    inside. I took out my East German ID card and showed it to the person who was
                    running the place. I said, “We're here, we're American diplomats, we live down
                    the street, and we wanted to see how this election works. Can you take a couple
                    of minutes and tell us?” They were quite shocked and surprised, and yet they
                    were very friendly. There were three people sitting at the table and they said,
                    “We have this book of registry, so when people come in and show us their ID
                    card, and we check to see if they are on the registrar. Then we give them a
                    ballot.” Then the voters were to walk across the room to a table. As they walked
                    across the room, they passed six or seven people sitting in front of them. Just
                    sitting there. All you have to do is fold this ballot. On the ballot there was
                    one list; there was nothing to check or anything, just the list. It was called
                    the National List and had all the names of all parties, affiliations behind the
                    individual candidates, but they had only one list. All you did was fold this,
                    walk past these officials and drop it in the ballot box. Being a “fair” system,
                    if you did not want to vote for somebody, you could go a little bit further, and
                    turn left, and stop at a table. The table was private. It looked like they had
                    taken an old door and cut it into three pieces so you could put it on the side
                    so you could have a private vote and you could line through anybody you didn't
                    like. And then fold up your ballot, drop it in the box, and walk out in front of
                    the assembled panel. These people were, of course, all neighbors who knew the
                    voters and would report you to the Stasi. I thought, this was a rather
                    intimidating system, but fascinating. The next day the results were published.
                    Not surprisingly, the national list received 98% of the vote. However, my new
                    friends, the Thomas Krueger gang, announced that their tally didn't match the
                    one of the government. It was only 85% or so in the districts they had watched,
                    instead of 98%. Plenty to win, but not valid.</p>
                <p>So began the process. Police came to visit them, they were harassed, some were
                    arrested. They were not held in jail, but they were not free and this
                    intimidation process began. They had challenged the GDR beyond the limits of
                    toleration accepted by the GDR. The next step was for the GDR to just lay down
                    the law. But then the events of May turned attention to China. Gorbachev visited
                    China and he was going to talk about Glasnost and Perestroika in China where the
                    democracy demonstrations on Tiananmen Square in Beijing had seized the world's
                    attention. Gorbachev had to be taken in a back door to meet the Chinese
                    leadership. Pictures flashed across the TV screen in the GDR as well, of how a
                    communist government dealt with the demonstrators who went to the streets. By
                    June 4, 1989 tanks rolled killing people, many were arrested. This Chinese
                    repression of a “counterrevolution” obviously suited Honecker because the next
                    day or a few days later he invited the Chinese Foreign Minister who was in
                    Moscow to come to East Berlin. To send a very strong signal to the domestic
                    population there: “If you guys fool around with us, you are
                    counterrevolutionaries, we like the way Chinese treated their
                    counterrevolutionaries.” That threat became the discussion on the street of what
                    was happening.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>About the same time, there was another visitor to East Berlin. His name was
                    Mengistu. He was from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. While he was in East Berlin there
                    was a coup attempt against his government in Addis Ababa. It failed. He went
                    back to Ethiopia and the message that the GDR released in June was:</p>
                <p>“You know, this coup attempt against this communist leader failed because he had
                    150 East German Stasi security specialists. If any of you in the Central
                    Committee decide me, I, Honecker, should not be your leader anymore, remember, I
                    have Stasi, I have my state security people. Don't fool with me.”</p>
                <p>So there we had two examples of the budding revolutionary debate. I mean,
                    hindsight is much clearer. At that time in fact I came back to Washington for a
                    visit and had dinner with former Berlin Governing Mayor Eberhard Diepgen here in
                    Washington at a German Embassy Officer's home. We talked about this very thing.
                    He had been the mayor of West Berlin. He just lost the mayor's job in January to
                    SPD leader Mr. [Walter] Momper, who was the West Berlin mayor in 1989-1990. We
                    chatted about the situation in East Germany and he agreed that the impending
                    crisis in East German was threatening.</p>
                <p>In the summer Honecker went to the meeting of Warsaw Pact in Romania, got sick,
                    and came back for medical treatment. The thought in the government was: “Okay,
                    maybe we won't have to have a counterrevolutionary movement; maybe the threat
                    will just go away.” Honecker left G�nther Mittag in charge. G�nther Mittag was
                    an old-line communist but he was “acting” so he didn't have the same kind of
                    authority as Honecker. However, to keep the threat against the
                    counterrevolutionaries strong, Honecker sent Egon Krenz, his likely successor to
                    China to reinforce the message that the GDR would treat challenges to the SED
                    they same way that the Chinese had on Tiananmen Square.</p>
                <p>During that summer, one event captured the debate for us. The same East German
                    protector of the communist ideology and who had been in Washington in 1988
                    clearing the way for a Honecker visit, Otto Reinhold, spoke to the
                    counterrevolutionary issue on his August 1989 radio-show. On the radio-show he
                    would normally give ideological announcements and arguments for debate. In
                    August 1989, he proposed a rhetorical question addressing both Gorbachev's
                    Perestroika and those who wished for West German-like economic reform (and
                    prosperity) when he said: “What reason would a capitalist East Germany have to
                    exist next to a capitalist West Germany?” The answer was easy. None, of course,
                    and therefore Reinhold went on to argue that they would have to remain
                    communist. However, his question was more penetrating than at first noticed.
                    Well, if you frame a question like that, you can just stop with the 'none',
                    because there is no reason for the GDR to exist if it were to be capitalist (and
                    prosperous). Therefore the question became: “Well, should we be capitalist or
                    not?” So Reinhold promoted that debate about the capitalist future of the GDR
                    that became the center of attention.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You talk about the center of attention. Were you finding
                        througone source or another that East Germans were talking about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: This was not a national movement. Very few individuals dared to
                    challenged the East German Authorities. Those that were, were the people like
                    Thomas Krueger, and Ruth and Hans Misselwitz. Ruth Misselwitz was the Lutheran
                    minister in the Pankow Lutheran church. Her husband had visited Washington in
                    1988 and I met him during his year-long exchange with the Lutheran Church. Their
                    children and his wife were not allowed to leave the country and that deeply
                    impressed me. They were brave enough to talk about the repression in the GDR.
                    Ruth is one of the most impressive revolutionaries that I met during this
                    period. As they moved through this debate, it was really only a small elite that
                    was actively resisting. But the point was we were on the ground hearing that
                    something was going on, and we wanted to know what how they would challenge the
                    East German government.At the same time, obviously somewhere outside of where we
                    were in our little world, the debate was what's happening in Eastern Europe,
                    there's change, the Washington Post and Herald Tribune ran an editorial in
                    August 1989, which stated the conventional wisdom. If the Soviet Union were to
                    intervene anywhere to defend its interests it would be in the GDR. And they are
                    willing to do act to defend their interests. That's what we believed, that's
                    what we've been taught for all of our cold war experience and that was the
                    framework. If the Soviets were to intervene then we would be facing a
                    confrontation and such a confrontation, if you follow the cold war thinking,
                    would lead to an uprising in the GDR, followed by the Soviet Union crushing the
                    dissidents and then attacking the West. That was the worst case scenario, but
                    that was the game plan for the World War III, that I could attest from my Army
                    experience. That scenario was the context for the fledgling revolution in East
                    Germany.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>That revolution began with a few demonstrations that had also been a part of this
                    anti-nuclear, anti-missile deployment protests in West Berlin. One major effort
                    was undertaken by a Lutheran Pastor, Christian F�hrer, from the Nikolai Church
                    in Leipzig. F�hrer had begun a protest movement, sanctioned by the GDR in the
                    early 1980s, to fight the deployment of the U.S. neutron bomb back in 1978. He
                    was only able to continue in this little circle with the encouragement or at
                    least tacit support of GDR, which was given because F�hrer's group was
                    anti-Western. As the debate evolved through the deployment and withdrawal of the
                    Neutron Bomb and then turned against the deployment of U.S. Pershing missiles.
                    This little group also transformed and began to question the SS-4 Soviet
                    short-range missiles in Germany as well as the SS-23. As the debates against the
                    deployment the GDR reached out in 1989, Gorbachev had nearly four years of the
                    new policy changes in the Soviet Union, Glasnost and Perestroika. The East
                    German protest movement used Glasnost to protest without confrontation.
                    Demonstrations at Nikolai Kirche in Leipzig became the focal point of
                    demonstrations every Monday night to speak out for peace for freedom of travel
                    guaranteed by the Helsinki Final Act in 1975. Every Monday night at six o'clock,
                    at 5 o'clock they would have a vigil, which grew in intensity as the GDR
                    arrested some of the protesters. The vigil added a plea for their release. After
                    the vigil the protestors would march outside, careful to talk about renewal of
                    the GDR, not revolution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While they were doing this were you all sort of taking
                        soundings and including help from our intelligence sources, finding out what
                        was going? I mean, did you have any feel for the ferment from intelligence
                        source or from personal Embassy observations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Yes, we had a sense that much was changing. We had Embassy officers,
                    secretaries and visitors in Leipzig to watch the demonstrations and to talk to
                    the demonstrators. Imre Lipping was our man in Leipzig and he reported that the
                    demonstrators were very serious. However, their theme was renewal of the GDR.
                    They didn't want to talk about revolution because that would lead to accusations
                    they were counter-revolutionaries and they would face certain arrest, even death
                    as in Tiananmen Square in Beijing. The demonstrators told us that one Monday the
                    husband would participate in the demonstration and his wife would stay at home
                    with the children. The following week the wife would go to the demonstration and
                    the husband stayed at home. The fear they felt was intense; they feared for
                    their lives. This fear was real, although it was not a subject covered much in
                    the press.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>The demonstrations seemed to be peaceful, but the question was always when do the
                    security forces move against them and crush them, because at that moment of
                    truth there was only one historical example in East German historJune 17, 1953
                    when Soviet tanks rolled and crushed a worker's uprising. A few hundred to few
                    thousand people participated in the September 1989 Leipzig Monday night
                    demonstrations. The focal point of political events swayed between Leipzig and
                    Berlin where Honecker prepared for the 40th anniversary of the GDR. Soviet
                    President Gorbachev was coming to Berlin on the 6th of October to celebrate East
                    Germany's 40th anniversary. We assumed that Gorbachev would demand Honecker
                    accept Glasnost and Perestroika or would not endorse Honecker as East Germany's
                    leader, which would signal the beginning of change of leadership. We had this
                    discussion in the Embassy, Jon Greenwald was looking at the party itself, and
                    saying, “They know that Honecker's time is coming to an end, and he is opposed
                    to Glasnost and Perestroika.” Jon asked if Gorbachev would give him a nudge and
                    make way for the next generation. Gorbachev wanted Hans Modrow to be his man
                    because Modrow was close to Gorbachev and believed in Glasnost and Perestroika.
                    Honecker knew this relationship was threatening to him and didn't want Modrow
                    anywhere near Berlin. He kept him in Dresden as the SED leader there, away from
                    the Central Committee and the Politburo. Honecker knew if Modrow were in the
                    Politburo, Gorbachev would have his man in place to follow Honecker and proceed
                    with the renewal of the GDR. This internal battle was very intense and all eyes
                    turned to Gorbachev's visit as the determining event in the life of the GDR,
                    which also reflected our view that East Germany was not legitimate; that it
                    existed because the Soviets supported it.</p>

                <p>The 40th anniversary of the GDR became the demarcation between continuation or
                    renewal of the GDR and revolution. That summer young East Germans headed off on
                    vacation to Hungary with the intent of never returning. The Hungarians had
                    clipped the wire off the Iron Curtain in May, and by July or August there were
                    several hundred GDR citizens in Hungary. Ambassador Barkley and I went to have
                    coffee with Wolfgang Vogel at his modest lakeside cottage. Wolfgang Vogel was
                    Honecker's lawyer and had negotiated spy exchanges. He had worked with
                    Ambassador Barkley when I was in Bonn as one of Barkley's political officer. He
                    was famous for the exchange of U-2 pilot Gary Powers, who was shot down over the
                    Soviet Union, and for the freedom on Nathan Sharansky as well as dozens of other
                    dissidents and spies. That August we asked him about the East Germans who were
                    caught in Hungary. He understood that the Hungarians had signed back to the UN
                    Convention on Refugees, which had meant that they would not return people
                    fleeing from communism if they said they were refugees. This was significant
                    because the Warsaw Pact required the Hungarians to return the fleeing East
                    Germans. We reasoned that if Honecker's lawyer knew that this issue was there,
                    he knew that his boss Honecker had a problem keeping his youth in country. The
                    Hungarians did just what I would argue Gorbachev wanted them to do; they acted
                    independently to support Glasnost and Perestroika. They could be more open and
                    reformed, but still communist. They didn't need to fear these young people and
                    could tweak Honecker's rejection of Glasnost. The Hungarian action had nothing
                    to do with the West in my view, it had everything to do with Gorbachev and
                    Glasnost and Perestroika. Although I must add that German Foreign Minister
                    Genscher was astute and exploited the situation to get the East Germans out; the
                    East Germans were immediately eligible for West German citizenship. In any case,
                    the Hungarians let these young East Germans go and they arrived in Bergenland,
                    Austria with some fanfare. The Hungarians obviously, with hindsight,
                    underestimated what releasing these people would release in political fallout.
                    They didn't make it clear that they were making a statement in support of
                    Glasnost and against Honecker's recalcitrance, they just let these people go and
                    signaled their support for freedom of travel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it Honecker at this point was sort of an
                        anachronism with in the Block? He was the worst figure as far as people, he
                        had no popularity...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: That's right. He and the Czech leader were the two pro-Stalinist
                    leaders still resisting Glasnost. They were the two stalwarts to Stalinism, and
                    Gorbachev had to encourage them to go. The Hungarians led the way by doing
                    accepting Glasnost and that had encouraged everybody. In the back of our minds
                    we knew that the Poles had begun the revolution in 1980 with Solidarity. The
                    East Germans, and there were million East Germans who had signed up to
                    immigrate, started to poor over the Hungarian and Czechoslovakian borders. On
                    October 3rd, just before the 40th anniversary the GDR closed their border. That
                    is they had a visa requirement for Czechoslovakia and Hungary. The U.S. Embassy
                    in East Berlin was immediately affected on the night of the 3rd of October.
                    During the day 18 people were leaving the GDR and were turned back at the border
                    because they didn't have visas. They didn't go home however, they arrived in
                    Berlin and went to the Permanent Representation Office of West Germany seeking
                    to emigrate. The West German Mission had been closed since July 1989 because
                    over 100 refugees had sought the same route to freedom and it took my friend
                    Joerg von Studnitz months to win exit visas for them. On October 3 these new
                    group turned to the American Embassy. They arrived at the American Embassy late
                    in the day, and knocked on the door. A consul came out to meet them and said:
                    “What are you doing?” As he opened the door they rushed in and the moment was
                    captured on television. There were five children under five and 13 adults. They
                    told us that they wanted out of the GDR because they knew that after the 40th
                    anniversary the security forces would crush them and they would never get out of
                    East Germany. They feared that the American embassy was their only chance to
                    flee after begin turned back at the border. I reported to Ambassador Barkley and
                    he immediately called Wolfgang Vogel to inform him that we had these people in
                    the U.S. Embassy. He asked for some assistance and told Vogel that he thought it
                    appropriate that they leave. Working with Mary Rose Brandt, the Consul General,
                    we got their names and their identification, and Mary Rose Brandt took the names
                    to Vogel's office in the Reilerstrasse. Vogel went through the process of
                    getting approval from the Stasi and Honecker. The East Germans stayed overnight
                    in the front hall outside the “hardline” we used for security. We went shopping
                    for them to get some food and took care of them.</p>
                <p>At the same time outside the Embassy and around in East Berlin were 60 or 70 TV
                    crews preparing for 40th anniversary with nothing to do. We didn't think that
                    they cold see inside the building but we didn't know. In the morning there was a
                    news report that there were these people in the Embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whose news?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: German, but it didn't matter. It was a West Berlin news service. I
                    think what happened there was a journalist inside. As I came down I recall a
                    journalist sitting inside the lobby, who didn't say anything and left. The next
                    day we had the spotlight of the world turned on us. Suddenly we had 200 people
                    outside the Embassy trying to get in. The building itself was an old building,
                    which was built in the 1880s. After the Second World War it had been the home of
                    East German craftsman guild; we had taken it over in 1974 when we established
                    diplomatic relations with East Germany. The front door was cut from a wooden
                    frame in the center archway and it was very unstable. Although we had asked the
                    State Department for money to replace it with something more stable, we had to
                    live with the shaky portal. The refugees were between this wobbly door and the
                    hard line security parameter, which they obviously could not pass. We had no
                    choice but to keep them in the very front entry where this door could actually
                    fall on them, if it came to a confrontation.</p>
                <p>In the morning two hundred people converged on the embassy and stood outside our
                    door. I went out in the late morning to Vogel's office and he gave me this pad
                    of little pieces of paper with his signature on it, and name of each of the
                    fleeing East Germans, which was their free pass to get out.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>Then when I returned to the Embassy to give out the passes, the question became
                    whether we could convince these people that this slip of paper was real. By
                    about 3 o'clock in the afternoon or even earlier, the 200 people outside where
                    getting restless, and they were right up against the building. As DCM, I took
                    one of the most difficult decisions and called the East German Foreign Office
                    and I said, “We need to maintain the access to the building, could you have the
                    demonstrators move on the other side of the street? We don't want you to
                    disperse them, it's fine that they demonstrate, but we need access, we can't get
                    access.” I knew the danger of that decision when they loved that idea that the
                    Americans asked for the Volkspolizei to move against East Germans. They ordered
                    in the Volkspolizei to come and force the 200 people back across the street, but
                    still in front of the embassy.As the “Vopos [German guards]” were moving the
                    crowd, a woman sat down on the sidewalk with her kids. The Vopos returned for
                    her, picked her up and put her on the back of a police truck. The whole scene
                    was eerily reminiscent of the Nazis and the transports during the Holocaust. The
                    entire event was filmed by TV crews and was shown immediately on television,
                    including CNN. I was inside the chancery building so I couldn't see what was
                    going on outside, nor was I watching television so I couldn't see what was
                    showing on television, but the TV crews covered all angles. We still had the
                    eighteen fleeing Germans to set free with their Vogel exit passes and could not
                    open the doors without expecting a rush from the still assembled demonstrators
                    across the street. About 4 o'clock, I decided that we had to close the embassy
                    for the day. I told Ambassador Barkley: “What we really need to do is close the
                    Embassy and people would perhaps go home so we could get these 18 people out.”
                    Well, the word that we were closing reached the demonstrators outside of the
                    building and also the television crews, which reported immediately and surprised
                    the State Department. Jim Dobbins, the European Bureau Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary called before I could get from the front door to my office. He was
                    outraged and irate. Apparently, he had just heard it from the Secretary's office
                    and they were yelling at him, and he was yelling at me. They assumed that we
                    were closing the embassy permanently, as the West Germans had done earlier and
                    to do so needed a decision by the State Department. I explained dangers of the
                    door, the crowd of demonstrators seeking to force their way into the embassy and
                    tried to reassure him. I said: “Jim, it's 4 o'clock, we'll be open tomorrow,
                    we're not closing like the West German mission, we just need to provided for the
                    safety of these people we are helping to flee East Germany...” He was still not
                    happy, but given assurance that we were just closing early for the day and not
                    permanently shutting, he reluctantly accepted my report. We wanted to maintain
                    an open Embassy and had no argument with Washington. Ambassador Barkley also
                    went back to Vogel and asked him to take into consideration any of the
                    demonstrators who also applied for exit visas and asked that they be treated
                    favorably. Vogel gave us assurances that the message would be delivered and told
                    Barkley that he had already identified the woman and children, who were loaded
                    on the police truck to get them exit visas. After we closed for the day, we were
                    able to let the East Germans out without incident as they made their way to West
                    Berlin and freedom. That facilitation was the kind of role we could play in this
                    revolution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say you got them out, what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: We just opened the door, they had decide for themselves to walk out
                    on their own. We were not going to force anybody out. We had to convince them
                    that what we had done was legitimate. Wolfgang Vogel called and he talked
                    directly to them, explaining that they had to believe in this piece of paper and
                    that voice on the phone (Vogel's) had negotiated a free passage for themselves
                    and their husbands and wives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did somebody go with them to see if they got out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: No, we didn't, but we had no feedback; they either left or they were
                    happy. However, for us the issue was not to repeat an earlier incident in the
                    same embassy when a fleeing East German was turned away and immediately arrested
                    by the East German police. Not repeating that nightmare was always the question
                    for us. We would not expel people from the Embassy, nor could we give them
                    asylum nor could we guarantee their immigration. We could only act as a
                    facilitator between them and the GDR government, in this case with Wolfgang
                    Vogel. We had found Wolfgang Vogel over the many years we dealt with him a very
                    honest, straightforward man, even if he was dealing with the devil as Erich
                    Honecker's lawyer. Vogel was still a respected person.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they got out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: They got out. I know some of them got out and I assumthe rest of them
                    did too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: By then we were already noticing that the revolution was like a video
                    flashing before our eyes, all the demonstrations and activities had been set on
                    fast forward and the revolution was going 24 hours a day. It became very hard
                    for us to keep up with all of these events that kept occurring. The next big
                    event was the Fortieth Anniversary of the German Democratic Republic when
                    Honecker would receive Soviet President Gorbachev in East Berlin. Barkley was
                    invited to a State Dinner for Gorbachev and other communist dignitaries like
                    Nicaraguan Daniel Ortega and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. The communists
                    all came. Honecker had a torchlight parade - Fackelzug - that evening on the
                    7th. The embassy staff was in the Embassy and gathered there in the Political
                    Section with Political Counselor Jon Greenwald. On the street the Free
                    Democratic East German Youth (FDJ), wearing their blue shirts and carrying
                    torches, marched in a torch lightparade. Like Hitler's Jugend, the FDJ marched
                    by the Brandenburg gate. They marched around the Embassy, beginning at their
                    assembly point behind the Embassy at the Metropole Hotel. Once their torches
                    were lit, they marched in front of the Embassy turned left and marched down
                    Unter den Linden where Honecker was standing on risers in front of the
                    Kronprinzenpalais. Honecker was glassy-eyed, kind of aged, with his almost
                    mechanical arm waving at them. The FDJ looked happy and cheerful as they
                    marched. Whether they were acting or really having fun, it was hard to tell. The
                    torches were impressive and it looked like there were hundreds of thousands of
                    them. Actually, maybe ten thousand that were marching around but in a circle
                    repeatedly around the U.S. Embassy. What was terror under Hitler seemed to be a
                    farce under Honecker; the Fackelzug evoked mixed emotions.</p>
                <p>The mood in East Berlin that night was very eerie, and it was at that evening
                    that Honecker and Gorbachev met. Even the message that came out of that meeting
                    was a riddle. We understood that Gorbachev had said to Honecker: “Those who come
                    too late will be punished by history.” What does this mean? We could only assume
                    that it meant that either Honecker changed and took Glasnost and Perestroika, or
                    he would be punished and be over. Gorbachev then went into the streets and had
                    some interviews that were shown on television. In theory these were real East
                    Germans talking to him, I doubted it. The questions Gorbachev was asked about
                    the problems in the GDR. His comment that he wished the Soviets had East German
                    difficulties later appeared on television, so I'm sure it was all staged. His
                    message was delivered and he left.</p>
                <p>The minute he left that evening on 7th of October there was a demonstration at
                    the Gethsemane Church, which was between my house and the Embassy. As I drove
                    home that evening about 8 o'clock, the demonstrators blocked the street. The
                    church is one block back from the Sch�nhauserallee and the demonstrators, who
                    were numbered thousands had poured out into that street. I stopped, because I
                    couldn't get through, rolled down my window and asked what was going on. As I
                    chatted with some of these demonstrators, I learned of their fears of a
                    crackdown by the East Germans now that Gorbachev was gone. After they moved
                    aside, I drove home.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>During that night the people's police moved against these demonstrators, they had
                    trucks with big shovels in the front, they had dogs, they arrested about a
                    thousand people. They took them to various staging areas just as the East
                    Germans thought it would happen. They were interrogated, they were mistreated,
                    no one was killed, but the stage was set. People understood that the crunch was
                    coming. This was now the time for the security forces to confront the
                    demonstrators and take the Chinese solution. So tensions rose dramatically.</p>
                <p>The previous Sunday at our church, Maria Magdalena in Pankow, the priest at the
                    end of the service said there would be gathering of the members of the parish to
                    talk about the debate over the “renewal of the GDR,” code words for what was to
                    become the revolution. After that Saturday night, the 7th of October events
                    could not be contained even with Catholic Church discussions for peaceful action
                    of renewal. On the 8th of October I took my family to church. At the end of that
                    church service the pastor said, “The mass has ended and you can go, but a member
                    of the parish would like to read a letter.” There had been a discussion out in
                    the church circles that they needed to take action (Catholics, unlike the
                    Lutherans, were not politically active in the GDR). Writing a letter seemed to
                    be a reasonable, not provocative thing to do. No one left the church. This
                    parishioner got up and in front of the church and said: “We met, we talked about
                    the renewal of our country and what we needed to do. We decided we would write
                    this letter to head of the People's Chamber, Volkskammer, the parliament. They
                    are supposed to be representing us. We wrote this letter. 'Dear Mr.
                    Sinderman...'" He went on and said something like, “We demand the separation of
                    the SED, the East German Communist Party, from the government, we demand SED out
                    of our schools, we demand the right to pursue our religion.” I was thinking:
                    “This is like St. Paul's Cathedral in Frankfurt in 1848. This is serious. This
                    man is declaring himself and anybody who signs this as an enemy of the East
                    Germans. He brought the letter to the back of the church and he said, “I don't
                    want any scribbling, I want to be able to read your name and address.” A lot of
                    people, but not everyone, signed it. Then they went outside to the courtyard
                    around the church and now they didn't know what to do. They knew they would be
                    reported on by their friends and neighbors and expected visits by the Stasi.
                    Slowly they got their courage and they walked outside of their church. And
                    nothing happened to them.</p>
                <p>On Monday night, October 9, 1989 there were protest vigils at the Gethsemane
                    Church in Berlin, and as always in Leipzig and Dresden as well as other places
                    around the country. The vigil at the Gethsemane Church was one at the same
                    church that had been attacked by the police on Saturday night. The Maria
                    Magdalena parishioner went to the Gethsemane Church. I'm told that he got up and
                    said, “We are with you.” He was a Catholic and Catholics were renown for not
                    being political at all and for tolerating all, while the Protestants had fought
                    for their role in the society to some degree of success or not. He said, “We
                    join with you in this effort.”</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>Such vigils after October 7, and reports like this, whether this report was
                    totally accurate or not, signaled the change from renewal to revolution,
                    although honestly we did not yet see what would come out of this mess. There was
                    unity among the dissidents after the attacks by the police on October 7 as well
                    as the sense that confrontation was coming and would end in a very unpleasant
                    way. There seemed to be no alternative, and the dissidents had to stick to what
                    they believed in. On Monday, the focus turned to Leipzig. The demonstration in
                    Leipzig on October 9, 1989 was the largest. In the month of September the
                    numbers went from a few thousand, to tens of thousands, to hundreds of
                    thousands. On October 9th we really feared that now there would be a
                    confrontation. The six leading figures from the community met in the afternoon,
                    among them were Kurt Mazur, the director of the Gewandhaus Orchestra, who
                    currently today is the director of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. Kurt
                    Mazur, the SED East German Secretary for Leipzig, a caberetist, a couple of
                    communists and police representatives set down at a table to discuss what they
                    could do. They really didn't have authority from Berlin to do anything because
                    they had to get from Berlin permission to prevent the demonstration. However, if
                    the situation got out of hand the Volkspolizei would intervene and Honecker's
                    counter-revolutionaries would be put down first in Leipzig on October 9th. The
                    risks confrontation were known knew already on October 3rd, when the GDR imposed
                    a visa requirement on East Germans traveling to Czechoslovakia or Hungary. The
                    SED was greatly embarrassed by the trainload of East German “refugees,” who had
                    been released from the West German Embassy in Prague. The Honecker regime
                    demanded that the train pass through East Germany and the Germans get papers
                    from the GDR as they went to Hof in West Germany. The train was blocked in
                    Dresden and there had been a confrontation in Dresden at the train station.
                    Police used tear gas and clubs to clear the tracks to move away other East
                    Germans wanting to get on the train. All sides were very much on a verge of a
                    violent confrontation.</p>
                <p>The six men gathered in Leipzig on the afternoon of October 9 decided they needed
                    to act. Kurt Mazur agreed to make a statement, which he would tape on a little
                    cassette and would allow it to be played on the radio. The others would not stop
                    it from being played. What is still not clear in my mind, because we were not
                    there, was whether or not police agreed, tolerated, or simply ignored the plan
                    to broadcast the Mazur message calling for no violence. The tape was played
                    shortly before the Nikolaikirche vigil that evening. The tape basically said
                    “demonstrate, no violence.” Unstated was “the police will not do violence
                    against you.” As a result a huge demonstration occurred with perhaps one hundred
                    and fifty thousand people, who marched around the center ring of Leipzig. There
                    was no serious, violent confrontation, although there were some isolated
                    confrontations on the fringes.</p>
                <p>Then the crises moved from the street back to the SED and the Central Committee
                    and back into the Politburo. That week Honecker demanded that the
                    counter-revolutionary acts had to cease. The next week in Leipzig the
                    demonstration numbers doubled and two days later, on Wednesday the 18th,
                    Honecker was deposed.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>At that point the focus was totally on the Politburo. Egon Krenz took over from
                    Honecker, who was deposed. I was in my office speaking with a journalist from
                    the Wall Street Journal when I received the call that Honecker was deposed. I
                    noted the change to the journalist, who reported it without attribution.
                    Ambassador Barkley was at the barber and I reached him during his haircut. We
                    hurriedly tried to determine the meaning of the change in the Politburo.</p>
                <p>Egon Krenz we noted did not fire all members of the Honecker Politburo, he got
                    rid of only half of them. We determined that he already immediately didn't have
                    any credibility with the man in the street. Then the focus began in that
                    Politburo to seek to establish legitimacy and get the people with them. They
                    were nervous about the demonstrations, dissident activity and so many youth
                    escaping their paradise. We as well as they were focused on how the SED would
                    address the concerns of the people out on the street who wanted the freedom to
                    travel. The idea created by the Politburo was to revise the travel law allowing
                    more travel with the hope that changes would take care of the question of the
                    refugees and so forth. On the 6th of November, the GDR announced a revised
                    travel law in their newspaper, Neues Deutschland. At the same time the Premier,
                    their head of government, Willie Stoff, resigned, and became acting, interim
                    Premier.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Barkley came into the Embassy briefing that morning and asked what was
                    going on. It seemed that he couldn't get to the embassy because there were
                    demonstrations. He wanted to know what was going on. It was a fascinating staff
                    meeting. Jon Greenwald and I were already chatting and Jon reported that the SED
                    had changed the travel law, and that they had really liberalized the travel
                    regime. He was certain they were trying to make travel a reality. We set out to
                    find out what the demonstrations were about during the day. We were surprised to
                    see that the people rejected the changes to the travel law as too little, too
                    late. The dissidents were emboldened by what they had achieved. They had rid the
                    GDR of Honecker; however, they now had this weak guy Krenz, whose government
                    moved to change the travel law but they didn't like it. They wanted more. This
                    of course caused panic in the SED and the Politburo met again on the 9th. It was
                    the day to consider among other things more changes to the travel law.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>That afternoon I went out to Aspen Institute in West Berlin for a reception, in
                    honor of Hildegard Boucsein, who David Anderson had been chosen as his deputy
                    director. David was a retired Foreign Service Officer, and former U.S.
                    Ambassador to Yugoslavia. He hosted this reception for his deputy, and everyone
                    came. There were mayors of East Berlin, West Berlin, there were all the military
                    commanders from the West, all the political leaders. It was clear later to all
                    of us that nobody had an inkling of what was about to occur that evening. At the
                    end of the reception Wolfgang Vogel asked if I could give him a ride downtown to
                    his car which was in central Berlin, so I said “Of course.” We drove together to
                    the Ku'dam and on our way to get his car he told me about the GDR lawyers
                    collegium. They had met that day and recommended to the Politburo changes to the
                    travel law that would resolve this confrontation and help get the process back
                    on track. I dropped him off on the Invalidenstrasse, where he told me later he
                    had gone across there in 1961 and saw Soviet tanks stationed as the Berlin Wall
                    was built. On November 9, 1989 he had crossed to see Trabants lined up and
                    demonstrators already gathering.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Trabants being?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: The little East German car, two-cycled car made of plasticized
                    pressed wood, with a little lawn-mower-like engine that spewed out a mixture of
                    gasoline and oil. It was the symbol of the economy. It worked but you wouldn't
                    want to have one. I went back into the Embassy with my hot news to find Jon
                    Greenwald and his crew excited. They just heard an announcement by East German
                    [Guenther] Schabowski, who had said something like “If you want to go to the
                    West, you get the visa and you can go to the West. If you want to immigrate, the
                    GDR will set up a new office to process immigration immediately.” Jon said:
                    “This announcement is unbelievable as well as the changes from the last couple
                    of days.” Jon sent Imre Lipping, a political officer, out to find out the text
                    of the Schabowski announcement at the press center. He sent Heather Troutman,
                    another political officer, out to Checkpoint Charlie to see what was happening.
                    In the next hour or two we watched the second broadcast of this statement by
                    Schabowski on the eight o'clock West German news, Tagesspiegel. Jon got the text
                    and sent a cable immediately with the text. We called the Operations Center and
                    the White House Situation Room to try to make sure they got the cable. I talked
                    to Harry Gilmore who was the U.S. Minister in West Berlin and basically said
                    “Harry, looks like you are going to have a lot of visitors soon, but we are not
                    sure what it looks like, probably tomorrow or the next day when they start
                    issuing visas.”</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>As I drove up Sch�nhauserallee in East Berlin to Bornholmerstrasse, which is a
                    checkpoint across the Berlin Wall where my children went from East Berlin to
                    school in West Berlin, I saw Trabant automobiles parked haphazardly around the
                    streets and a group of people standing in front of the gate. I heard them saying
                    something, but I couldn't understand exactly what it was they were yelling. I
                    decided that I could watch them on television. I saw on the other side if the
                    Wall a television crew with its lights on. I thought I could probably see this
                    on television and besides I needed to get to a telephone. As soon as I arrived
                    home around 10:00 pm, I got on the telephone and obviously made noise as I
                    turned on the television. Jean, my wife, came in and said, “What are you doing?”
                    I told here that something going on at the Wall and we had to find out what was
                    going on. She was concerned that our kids were sleeping, but I told her we had
                    to do this as the Berlin Wall was being besieged. I called Ambassador Barkley
                    and told him to turn on his television. He was incredulous and I told him he
                    would not believe what's happening. I called Harry Gilmore to revise me earlier
                    statements. I said, “Harry, remember I told you hat you would going to be seeing
                    lots of visitors maybe in the next few days. Well, they might be tonight. It
                    looks like things are going to break loose, we don't know how it will
                    happen.”</p>
                <p>We watched the TV, we saw those first people go through the Wall. We saw the
                    lights come on in the neighborhood, we spent several hours talking,
                    coordinating, it seemed to be going peacefully. I got a couple of hours of
                    sleep, woke up my kids because they had to go to school. I put them put
                    Annamarie, my daughter in the car with two other kids with some trepidation. I
                    decided to drive behind them in my personal car to the same Bornholmerstrasse
                    checkpoint. When we arrived, there were people everywhere at seven o'clock in
                    the morning. There were people going back and forth, and yet they were very
                    nice. They saw the red diplomatic license plate that indicated a diplomatic car
                    that carried Annamarie, they moved aside and let her through. As she drove off
                    through the Bornholmerstrasse into West Berlin, I said to myself: “Well, there
                    she goes. Will I see her again? What's going on here?”</p>
                <p>Shortly afterward, the GDR announced that their visa requirement, which had not
                    been imposed overnight, would be required as of eight o'clock in the morning. I
                    stayed at the checkpoint watching people coming back and forth. About 20 minutes
                    to eight, there was a huge influx of people coming down the street to try to get
                    across into West Berlin before the eight o'clock deadline for visas. When eight
                    o'clock came the people were still everywhere, and in order to avoid a
                    confrontation, the visa requirement time was moved to noon.</p>
                <p>I went to the office, went through all of the activities we were doing. At noon
                    the deadline was moved to Monday, and for us, the Berlin Wall had, as we had
                    reported earlier, become irrelevant. The Wall had not only become irrelevant,
                    the East German government had become irrelevant. They lost the authority of
                    government to do basic things like issue visas. They had no control over that
                    crucial aspect of their authority. The Soviets didn't intervene. We thought they
                    would do something. They were clearly taken by surprise as East German
                    government was taken by surprise what had occurred.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>But that wasn't the end of the story. For weeks I tried to figure out who gave
                    the order, why did they do this? We asked guards, we asked individuals, nobody
                    had seemed to have given an order. I had been at Bornholmerstrasse, a checkpoint
                    that was on a bridge over the S-Bahn train tracks and it had two or three police
                    barracks in it. Driving across the checkpoint, I had seen that these barracks
                    were filled with soldiers with rifles. I'd seen fire-hoses laid out next to
                    these barracks in preparation to spray against people. The hoses were used on
                    people as we saw on television at the Brandenburg Gate. I couldn't figure out
                    what was happening. A couple of months later, Jean and I were over having coffee
                    with some of the people from the church where we were, and we were talking about
                    his story. One of them got up and said, “Would you like to know what happened?”
                    I said, “Of course, I want to know, I can't figure this out.” This person went
                    and got his East German identification card, which is a billfold-like picture
                    passport. I opened it up and on one side there is a picture and on the other
                    side is his name and date of birth. On the picture the guard at
                    Bornholmerstrasse, where this person had been that night, had stamped across the
                    picture an exit visa, making the ID invalid. He was thrown out! They expelled
                    the first hundred or so people who were standing there that I had seen there
                    that night. They threw them out and were intending to close the gate area to
                    avoid a confrontation. Getting rid of the first demonstrators by expulsion was
                    an expedient solution. But what went wrong?</p>
                <p>What went wrong was on the other side of the street when they got through the
                    gate was this guy with the camera. The camera team was from Spiegel Television I
                    learned later, in fact several years later in Hamburg. I was telling the same
                    story when Steven Aust of Spiegel stopped me before I said what I have just said
                    and told me, “Would you like to know what happened,” and I said “Yes.” He told
                    the same story. His TV crew was waiting on the other side, they filmed these
                    people, they didn't asked if they were expelled, they just filmed them. But then
                    they went back after having collected these films and interviewed he guards and
                    some of the people and had found that these people were indeed expelled.</p>
                <p>The beauty of the multi-media world that we live in, the only thing that was in
                    public domain was all these people were free. That's why all the lights came on
                    in the neighborhood, because they saw on television all these people were going
                    and they got up and took the only chance they had for freedom. They knew the GDR
                    would not give them visas, and decided to go on their own. when the visa
                    requirement gave them the window. They poured into West Berlin, thinking it was
                    over, that was the only chance they were getting. People were driving from miles
                    outside Berlin to get there in time to go across because they thought it was the
                    only chance in their life they would have to go to Berlin. And it was because
                    the television only reported what they had seen and not the facts, and good that
                    they didn't in this case.[Note: I would like to add my written recollections on
                    the night the Berlin Wall fell, as contained in a speech I delivered at the

                <p>A speech by Ambassador J.D. Bindenageformer Deputy U.S. Ambassador to the German
                    Democratic Republic</p>
                <p>Thank you, Professor Wegs, for the invitation to speak at the Nanovic Center for
                    European Affairs. It is a rare pleasure for a practitioner of diplomacy to step
                    back from the intense pressure of instant analysis and reflect on some of the
                    implications of today's politics on the ideas that shape our lives.</p>
                <p>The major conflict of ideas that has shaped my career was the East-West
                    confrontation between capitalism and communism. In fact, I have spent a majority
                    of my professional career defending freedom from the communist threat. The
                    symbolic vortex of that conflict was at the Fulda Gap in Germany, where a
                    million soldiers from NATO were lined up against a million soldiers from the
                    Warsaw Pact ready to destroy the world. I myself was an infantry officer in
                    Wuerzburg, Germany, near the Fulda Gap, this main Soviet invasion route across
                    Central Europe.</p>
                <p>Recently, a friend of mine, Major General Bruce Scott, recounted his briefing to
                    newly commissioned army officers in this post-cold war world. General Scott was
                    somewhat uncertain whether these new officers knew about the significance of the
                    Fulda Gap, or even whether they knew if the Fulda Gap existed. When he voiced
                    his concern in his briefing, a young lieutenant responded that he had just
                    returned from a visit to Fulda, Germany, where they had built a new shopping
                    center and he could assure the General that there was a Gap there. He had
                    shopped there himself. How times have changed.</p>
                <p>The division of Germany, Europe and the world into two fundamentally opposed
                    ideologies prepared to destroy the world seems so distant, but the fear-filled
                    emotion of the division of Europe in the Cold War has left lasting legacy for
                    us. The division of Berlin, symbolized by the Berlin Wall, was for us a deeply
                    terrorizing reminder of man's inhumanity to man.</p>
                <p>During the first year of the Berlin Wall more than 50 people died trying to
                    escape the communist paradise. On August 17, 1962, 18-year-old East Berliner
                    Peter Fechter tried to escape near Checkpoint Charlie. As he climbed the Wall,
                    his own East German border guards shot him. For hours he lay helpless and
                    unattended at the foot of the Berlin Wall while he bled to death. The worldwide
                    rejoicing at the fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9, 1989 was easily
                    understood everywhere as an end to this affront to the dignity of human beings
                    everywhere. Throughout its 28-year existence, the Berlin Wall divided, but did
                    not conquer the spirit of the Germans in the German Democratic Republic. The end
                    of the Berlin Wall brought a new, reborn Germanthe Berlin Republidedicated to
                    human dignity, founded in democratic institutions of the Bonn Republic and the
                    democratic revolution in East Germany.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>I was the deputy American ambassador in East Berlin when the Berlin Wall was
                    breached. Later I was country director for Germany in the State Department and
                    then deputy and acting American Ambassador in the Berlin Republic. The question
                    most asked over the past decade was and is; “What is the Berlin Republic?” The
                    following question was inevitably; “What does this new Germany, the Berlin
                    Republic, mean to the United States?”</p>
                <p>Although the revolution of 1989 was the last act in the cold war, no hot war
                    ensued. Now the Berlin Republic has begun to take its rightful place in Europe;
                    recently Chancellor Schroeder described it as a major European power. Germany
                    has undoubtedly become a major European power deploying its military forces in
                    combat alongside its NATO allies for the first time since World War II and
                    modernizing its economy to compete globally. I would like to explore with you
                    today my observations on the Berlin Republic and its implications for
                    German-American relations.</p>
                <p>The future of our relations with Germany depends on our shared values, our shared
                    interests and our common solutions to issues in European security, economic
                    reform and global issues.</p>
                <p>Founding Myths of the Berlin Republic</p>
                <p>In order to analyze these issues, I would like to turn to some of thfounding
                    myths of the Berlin Republic.</p>
                <p>The political culture inherited by the Berlin Republic is one of continuity and
                    discontinuity. The Federal Republic's Basic law, created fifty years ago,
                    embodies the country's continuity in democratic institutions from the Bonn
                    Republic. The Democratic Revolution of 1989 led to the democratic government in
                    1990 that ended the German Democratic Republic and swept away most of the East
                    German institutionpolitical, social and economionly the political party of the
                    East, the re-christeneSocialist Unity Party, now the Party of Democratic
                    Socialism, has remained.</p>
                <p>The common commitment to core values of freedom, as demonstrated by the 1989
                    Revolutionary movement decrying the GDR Travel Law and the respect for human
                    dignity, in remembrance of those who died in the Holocaust, embodied in Article
                    I of the Basic Law and captured in the motto “Nie Wieder Auschwitz” unite the
                    halves of the formerly divided county.</p>
                <p>Democratic institutions legitimized by popular sovereignty in the March 18, 1990
                    election in the GDR that gave a mandate for German unity and in the September,
                    1998 election in the Berlin Republic that defeated a sitting government for the
                    first time in contemporary German history.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>Belief in the Social Market Economy that formed the basis for the transfer of
                    wealth, at an annual rate of $100 billion per year, from the western to the
                    eastern states to fund unfunded social security, unemployment compensation,
                    retraining programs and infrastructure.</p>
                <p>Shared History with the United States</p>
                <p>The United States shares with the Berlin Republic common commitments to freedom,
                    the respect for human dignity, democratic institutions and belief in the market
                    economy. We also share contemporary history.</p>
                <p>Beginning with Secretary of State James F. Byrnes Speech of Hope in Stuttgart in
                    1946 which offered Germany a place in the community of nations again, the United
                    States stood up to defend Berlin from Soviet attack beginning with the Berlin
                    Airlift in 1948. On June 17, 1953 the East Germans rebelled against their Soviet
                    occupiers and their effort for freedom was brutally crushed. After the Berlin
                    Wall was built in 1961, it became a symbol for our troubled times. President
                    John F. Kennedy won our hearts and those of the Germans when he said that free
                    me everywhere would be proud to say that they were “Berliner.” For ten years we
                    negotiated with the Soviets to create stability in Berlin and Germany,
                    eventually signing the Quadripartite Agreement in 1972. In the 1980s we deployed
                    Pershing missiles to defend Germany and Europe against the Soviet SS-20 rockets
                    that were aimed at Germany. By 1987 President Reagan called on President
                    Gorbachev, in the spirit of Glasnost and Perestroika to “Tear down this Wall.”
                    Just two years later the Germans in the GDR did just that in the Democratic
                    Revolution of 1989. Americans and Germans shared this history of Berlin and the
                    fight for freedom.</p>
                <p>We also lived up to our promises. It was American support for German unification
                    that was the key element in completing the East German's peaceful, democratic
                    revolution. We negotiated the 2+4 Agreement with the two Germanies and
                    “Victorious Powers” of the Second World War, and on October 3, 1990 helped to
                    bring the three parts of Germany together - the Federal Republic's
                    forty-year-old democracy, the freedom-seeking East Germans and Berlin - to
                    create a peaceful, democratic Germany in the heart of Europe. The Berlin
                    Republic was born. And with the new Berlin Republic has come an enlarged NATO
                    and many economic challenges; its new members can hope to enjoy some of the same
                    freedom, peace and prosperity found in the Berlin Republic today.</p>
                <p>The Heroes of BornholmerstrassNovember 9, 1989</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>Let me share with you one anecdote that captures the spirit of freedom on the
                    1989 Revolution. I was a fortunate eyewitness when the Berlin Wall came tumbling
                    down (Ich war dabei) twenty-eight years after the East German leader Walter
                    Ulbricht erected this hated symbol of communism and division. I was the deputy
                    American ambassador in East Berlin reporting on that democratic revolution that
                    would bring down the Berlin Wall, help end the cold war and create a new order,
                    in which Germany emerged once again united, sovereign and strong.</p>
                <p>Throughout the year 1989, dramatic events stirred a new sense of freedom in the
                    world and challenged the cold war. Soviet President Gorbachev began his Glasnost
                    and Perestroika experiment. Students in China demonstrated for democracy on
                    Tiananmen Square and were brutally crushed by communist tanks. In the two
                    Germanies 2 million soldiers still stood face-to-face across the Berlin Wall
                    ready for war.</p>
                <p>On the night of November 9, 1989, the entire world held its breath waiting for
                    the Soviet tanks to roll and crush the German revolutionaries as they had done
                    in 1953. Although the Soviet tanks did not roll out, revolution has changed our
                    world.</p>
                <p>The United States throughout the Cold War preached self-determination in an
                    effort to promote democracy movements and stationed millions of American
                    soldiers in West Germany to deter a communist attack. East Europeans had
                    repeatedly tried and failed to find freedom and break the yoke of communist
                    rule. Despite failed attempts in East Germany in 1953, in Hungary in 1956, in
                    Czechoslovakia in 1968, and in Poland in 1980, in the summer of 1989 the Central
                    Europeans tried again.</p>
                <p>At the American Embassy in East Berlin, we knew that the Red Army's response with
                    its million Soviet and East German soldiers deployed along the German-German
                    border would determine the success or failure of this new democratic revolution.
                    A Washington Post editorial in August that year reminded us that if the Soviet
                    Union intervened anywhere in Europe to protect its interests, it would do so in
                    East Germany.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, some East Germans wanted their freedom and sovereignty and were
                    willing to demand some of their rights guaranteed in the Helsinki Final Act
                    signed by their communist leader, Erich Honecker. These brave souls sought
                    freedom to travel and abolishing the East German travel law became the symbolic
                    cry for political freedom during their revolution. They knew the words of
                    President John Kennedy, that free men everywhere would be proud to call
                    themselves Berliners, and they knew President Ronald Reagan's challenge to
                    Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall. They were
                    testing that strong bond of common destiny in our commitment to the dignity of
                    man, the rule of law, and freedom.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>Events in the revolution were breathtaking. Tens of thousands of GDR citizens had
                    fled to the West and a million more were seeking to emigrate. Demonstrations by
                    thousands of demonstrators in the streets of Leipzig, Dresden and Berlin
                    threatened the government and by October 18 had led to the ouster of German
                    Communist leader Erich Honecker. The new GDR leader, Egon Krenz, was also a
                    communist and desperately needed to establish control of the government and to
                    win support of the people. We knew events could unravel the stability of the
                    cold war and our embassy reported on November 6 that the GDR Politburo was
                    changing the despised Travel Law and predicted hopefully that if such changes
                    continued, the Berlin Wall would become “irrelevant.”</p>
                <p>Based on our embassy's reporting, President George Bush was told in his November
                    9 morning briefing by his intelligence briefer, that the GDR had opened
                    possibilities for freer travel for its citizens and that the Berlin Wall might
                    as a result become “irrelevant,” the very description used by the American
                    Embassy's Political Counselor Jon Greenwald report. Now was the time to
                    determine whether this revolution fit the definition. I had never lived through
                    a revolution and only knew the textbook definition. I was about to experience it
                    very personally.</p>
                <p>While, as Timothy Garten Ash has noted, a century was defeated at the polls, I
                    believe that it was the democratic revolution that spread from Solidarity to the
                    Kremlin and ended communism in Europe. It is in the aftermath of the end of the
                    cold war that I have found the comments of Ralph Waldo Emerson about the
                    American Revolution to capture the new dynamic of European politics at the end
                    of the Millennium. He said, “If there is any one period one would desire to be
                    born in, is it not the Age of Revolution, when the old and new stand
                    side-by-side, when the energies of all men are searched by fear and by hope,
                    when the historic glories of the old can be compensated by the rich
                    possibilities of the new?”</p>
                <p>It Began as Any Normal Day in the Revolution</p>
                <p>Events during that Thursday in November were calm; President Gorbachev had ended
                    his visit in honor of the fortieth anniversary of East Germany with a warning
                    about the dramatic events East Germany saying, “Those who come too late will be
                    punished by history.” Little did we now that history was about to overtake
                    us.</p>
                <p>That same evening in Berlin I attended Aspen Institute Berlin Director David
                    Anderson's reception for his new deputy, Hildegard Boucsein, with the mayors of
                    East and West Berlin, the Allied Military Commanders, East German spy-swapping
                    lawyer Wolfgang Vogel and many others. We were an unsuspecting group of
                    insiders. What was about to happen at the Berlin Wall later on November 9, 1989
                    would be a surprise to us all.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>At the end of the reception, East German lawyer Wolfgang Vogel, who had
                    negotiated the freedom of Soviet dissident Sharansky and earlier the U-2 pilot
                    downed over Russia, Gary Powers, asked me for a ride to West Berlin where he had
                    parked his car. Of course I was pleased to offer him a lift and to seek his
                    assessment of the East German reaction to the changes in November 6 GDR Travel
                    Law that had been rejected by thousands of demonstrators throughout the country.
                    Vogel as Honecker's lawyer was most likely to know the GDR's next steps.</p>
                <p>A few months earlier when U.S. Ambassador Richard Barkley and I visited Vogel at
                    his modest home on the Titi Lake, he told us that the Hungarians would likely
                    allow several hundred East Germans in Hungary escape to the West. The Hungarians
                    had dramatically cut down the barbed wire fence along their border in May.
                    Indeed, the Hungarian border was viewed as an escape hatch from the communist
                    bloc and cutting down the fence launched a flood of refugees in late summer. The
                    Hungarians were about to honor their new commitment to a UN convention on
                    refugees and to ignore their obligations under the Warsaw Pact to return East
                    Germans to the GDR. Vogel would surely clue me in on Politburo thinking about
                    how to respond to the revolutionaries' demands for the right to travel
                    freely.</p>
                <p>On our way to the downtown West Berlin's heart on the Ku'dam, Vogel told me that
                    the GDR attorney's collegium had met November 7-8 and proposed additional
                    changes to the GDR Travel Law. Vogel thought the new changes, not yet announced,
                    would satisfy East Germans' demand for more freedom of travel.</p>
                <p>Back at the American Embassy</p>
                <p>As I drove into East Berlin around seven-thirty, the acrid smell of sulfur from
                    East Germany's brown coal met me. It was a knowing feeling that the smell
                    brought to my nostrils; the smell clung everywhere, in my clothes surrounding
                    the buildings. The smell of brown coal gave the whole of East Germany that
                    sinister, dreary appearance that had become so familiar.</p>
                <p>I went directly to the embassy where I found a greatly excited political section.
                    They were stunned by East German government spokesman Guenther Schabowski's
                    statement on television. He had told the world that the Politburo agreed to more
                    changes in the Travel Law and East Germans could get visitor visas quickly (in
                    kurzem) for travel to the West from their local “People's Police” and the GDR
                    would open a new processing center to handle emigration cases immediately.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>Although beyond anything we could have imagined, Schabowski's oral statement was
                    open to widely varying interpretation. NBC anchorman, Tom Brokaw, who attended
                    the Schabowski briefing, asked if this meant the Berlin Wall was open;
                    Schabowski reportedly said; “Yes.” He rushed to the western side of the
                    Brandenburg Gate to announce to the world that the Berlin Wall was open. The
                    East Germans heard; “Travel to the West is possible immediately.” The
                    revolution, once remarkably controlled, with its Monday night demonstrations in
                    Leipzig and Dresden, seemed to be spinning out of control.</p>
                <p>We sent one embassy political officer, Heather Troutman, directly to Checkpoint
                    Charlie and another, Imre Lipping, to the GDR press center to get the text of
                    the statement. While we were hunting down the travel law text, the first East
                    Germans, attempting to cross without visas, were sent back home by the guards at
                    Checkpoint Charlie who told them to first get visas. It seemed to us that the
                    GDR guards could keep things under control, while the new procedures were being
                    worked out.</p>
                <p>With the text of the announced freedom to travel and emigrate in hand, we
                    translated it and cabled it to Washington. I telephoned the White House
                    Situation Room and State Department Operations Center to make sure they had the
                    report and to alert them to the latest developments. Then I called Ambassador
                    Barkley and the American Minister in West Berlin Harry Gilmore, and we diplomats
                    shared our quick assessment of the Politburo announcement. We thought the East
                    Germans would get their visas and then head to West Berlin. Little did we know
                    how quickly the East Germans would test the will of the border police to let
                    them leave and return.</p>
                <p>After assuring ourselves that we had reporting officers in place to follow events
                    and had reported the latest news, I headed home to the near-in East Berlin
                    suburb of Pankow around 10:00 PM. As I drove up Sch�nhauserallee in East Berlin
                    I was surprised to see so many East German, plasticized pressed-wood Trabant
                    automobiles seemingly abandoned near the Bornholmerstrasse checkpoint crossing
                    over the S-Bahn train into West Berlin. At the end of the street near the
                    checkpoint, I saw dozens of Germans standing at the barrier and shouting at the
                    guards defending the crossing.</p>
                <p>I knew the crossing well. I crossed it regularly; my children crossed there daily
                    to attend the German-American John F. Kennedy Schule in Zehlendorf, West Berlin.
                    Inside the crossing were barracks filled with armed border police. Fire hoses,
                    like those used later at the Brandenburg Gate were carefully laid out in
                    readiness to repel any wall jumpers. Across the checkpoint safely in the West,
                    the bright lights of a TV camera crew, was poised on the bridge ready to
                    instantaneously transmit pictures of this confrontation at the bridge around the
                    world.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>I hurried through the last few blocks to get home quickly. Inside, I turned on
                    the television to see which pictures were being beamed at the East Germans from
                    the camera I had seen. My wife Jean rushed in to the TV room worried I would
                    wake our children. I explained the latest events and how our worry seemed to be
                    turning into excitement as we witnessed the fall of the Berlin Wall. I called
                    Ambassador Barkley, Jon Greenwald our political counselor and Harry Gilmore in
                    West Berlin. We knew events would soon envelop us.</p>
                <p>The Berlin Wall Falls</p>
                <p>Within minutes the Berlin Wall was breached. First, a wave of East Berliners came
                    through the Bornholmerstrasse checkpoint signaling freedom for all East Germans.
                    They streamed across and their pictures were flashed around the world. They were
                    free! But I had a sinking feeling. Did they have visas? What happened to the
                    visa requirement? Who was in charge? *</p>
                <p>A few hours later, around 6:30 A.M., I followed my third-grade daughter
                    Annamarie's school van to Bornholmerstrasse on her way through the crowd to
                    school in the West. Her van moved into the masses of people now streaming in
                    both directions. Seeing the red diplomatic license plate, the people stepped
                    aside to let her through. I stood there watching my child disappear into the
                    West with some uncertainty of her fate. My son Carl was to follow in less than
                    an hour.</p>
                <p>GDR radio announced that visas were required to travel as of 8:00 am on November
                    10. I stayed at Bornholmerstrasse and as the hour approached the crowd grew
                    larger and pressed against the checkpoint as panic spread. The fear of being
                    shut in, of having missed the chance to see West Berlin before the GDR shut the
                    gate, was palatable. Shortly before that appointed hour, that deadline was moved
                    to noon. Later, the deadline was revised to Monday. However, by Monday the Krenz
                    government had lost its legitimacy and its authority; the people had demanded
                    and won their freedom. Power and authority had passed from the SED government to
                    the people, who were now in charge. No one knew what would happen next.</p>
                <p>No-mans-land and the Death Strip</p>
                <p>We were all caught in the blurring pictures of the revolutionary video stuck on
                    fast-forward. Events in those hours overwhelmed us with a mixture of anxiety,
                    euphoria and hope for the future.</p>
                <p>When our children, Annamarie and Carl, returned from the John F. Kennedy Schule
                    in West Berlin, my wife, Jean, and I decided that we, too, would test the new
                    openness of the Berlin Wall. We ventured down to the Wall at Eberswalderstrasse,
                    where the buildings were in the East and the sidewalk was in West Berlin, and
                    where terrible scenes of desperate people jumping to their freedom or death
                    [took place] in 1961 when the Wall was built.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>The “Bausoldaten,” soldiers on construction duty, were deconstructing the Berlin
                    Wall at Eberwalderstrasse. They had already taken several three-meter tall,
                    one-meter wide sections out of the Wall by the time we arrived. Lined up in
                    front of this gaping hole were hundreds of East Germans dutifully waiting for
                    the East German Volkspolizei to issue them visas in accordance with the November
                    9 Schabowski statement.</p>
                <p>We had our diplomatic identity cards and proceeded to enter the no-mans-land
                    through the new crossing point. As we, accompanied by our dog Willi, stepped
                    into the eerie space between East and West, seven-year-old Carl exclaimed;
                    “There are two walls.” Indeed, at the end of the no-mans-land stood towering
                    above us was the whitewashed wall on the western side.</p>
                <p>We crossed into West Berlin with numerous East Germans and were greeted with
                    cheering West Berliners and a sense of time suspension. Disoriented, we found a
                    playground for our children where they played while Jean and I tried to absorb
                    the strangeness of standing in West Berlin amid so many East Germans.
                    Unification had just happened among the Germans and we were witnessing the
                    mixture of two conflicting systems separated for two generations. Berlin had
                    become an East German city overnight.</p>
                <p>After getting our personal bearings we turned back toward East Berlin and stepped
                    back into the death strip on our way home. As we entered the forbidden zone an
                    East German guard who blocked our way and demanded our passports approached us.
                    When we produced our East German Diplomatic identity cards, he rejected them
                    saying that the crossing was only for citizens of the German Democratic
                    Republic. We argued that we, too, lived in East Germany despite the fact that it
                    seemed incredible that any Westerner would voluntarily lived in that communist
                    country. After some heated dialogue, we were allowed to pass. Stepping back into
                    East Berlin was like wandering into the twilight zone, the country had
                    disappeared, and a revolution swept away the Berlin Wall and would soon sweep
                    away the very existence of East Germany itself.</p>
                <p>The End of East Germany</p>
                <p>I knew East Germany's days were limited. Only intervention by the Soviets could
                    prolong its agony. President Gorbachev risked Perestroika and Glasnost in Russia
                    if he chose to intervene militarily in the GDR; he would lose East Germany if he
                    did not. We had no idea of the next steps or how the revolution would play
                    out.</p>
                <p>While the world was caught up in the euphoria of the pictures at the Brandenburg
                    Gate, President Bush instructed us that there would be no dancing on the Wall.
                    The East Germans had won some freedom, but the revolution had unleashed the
                    forces of history contained by the cold war.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>Meeting with Gorbachev six months later, Gorbachev told President Bush that
                    Germany could decide whether or not to join NATO. In the intervening months the
                    greatest diplomatic venture since World War II was undertaken with the greatest
                    skill. Germany, with the vision and skillful leadership of the American
                    President and Chancellor Kohl, was unified and this millennium may end in peace
                    with Europe whole and free.</p>
                <p>Postscript</p>
                <p>There is a postscript to this story that I would also like to share. I felt there
                    were some unanswered questions about those first wall jumpers at
                    Bornholmerstrasse checkpoint. Did they have visas? Just what did those guards
                    with the hoses and rifles do to defend the Berlin Wall on November 9, 1989? A
                    few months after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Jean and I were having coffee with
                    the Uwe Gerson family, friends from our local East German church. Among the
                    guests were East Germans that had been among those at Bornholmerstrasse that
                    night.</p>
                <p>As we recounted this story, one of them asked if we knew what actually happened
                    to the first freedom-seekers who burst into the lights of the Spiegel TV cameras
                    and changed the course of history. Of course we did not and were intrigued to
                    hear a first-hand account. Herr Gerson's brother took out his GDR identification
                    card, a paper passport with a photograph on one side and his name typed on the
                    other. Across the picture was a GDR exit visa stamp. A stamp that actually
                    invalidated the I.D. card. It hit us. The first people crossing into the lights
                    of the TV camera* had been expelled! The GDR had tried to save itself from its
                    discontented citizens by throwing the rascals out of the country. Be gone you
                    revolutionaries, they must have said. The last laugh was on those guards. The
                    television pictures of people held back by a hated system fleeing into freedom
                    were too powerful to resist. The heroes of Bornholmerstrasse had taken their
                    fate in their own hands. East Germany fell to the irrepressible human desire for
                    freedom.</p>
                <p>The pictures were enough to rouse other East Germans from their sleep and head
                    for the Berlin Wall. The numbers soon overwhelmed the guards and the East German
                    government's implementation of its exit visa requirement was delayed and
                    delayed. Meanwhile the Germans in the GDR continued their revolution and took
                    ownership of their country.</p>
                <p>* Note: The Spiegel TV crew filming the East Germans great escape only reported
                    the first Germans to flee were free. Steven Aust, editor of the Spiegel told me
                    in October 1996 that he had sent that crew to film the crossing and had later
                    interviewed the guards who let the people into West Berlin. He confirmed that
                    the first to cross into the West had been expelled by the East German
                    guards.</p>
                <p>Conclusion</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>American support for German unification allowed the East German's peaceful,
                    democratic revolution success. On October 3, 1990, they would join with the
                    Federal Republic's forty-year-old democracy to create a peaceful, democratic
                    Germany in the heart of Europe. The Berlin Republic was born.</p>
                <p>Since then it is clear that the Berlin Republic, now under SPD Chancellor
                    Schroeder, has accepted the responsibilities accruing to a major European power
                    in providing security in southeaster Europe. The bombing war in Kosovo was also
                    a seminal event in German politics. Along with the United States, Germany chose
                    to lead our effort to stop the human rights abuses, ethnic cleansing that had
                    echoes of Nazi atrocities. In fact, the elevation of human rights as a basis for
                    armed intervention in violation of the sanctity of sovereignty will have lasting
                    effect on political relations for the next Millennium. Some have argued that the
                    intervention in Kosovo signaled the end, not of the cold war, but of the
                    Westphalian Peace that has governed international relations for centuries.</p>
                <p>In Germany the Kosovo decision is deeply rooted in the new political culture of
                    the Berlin Republic. Not only must war not emanate from German soil, but as
                    Foreign Minister Fischer has reminded us: “Nie Wieder Auschwitz” is the motto
                    that takes precedence over the sanctity of sovereignty. This political
                    commitment to human rights is deeply embedded in the German “Basic Law” in its
                    respect for human dignity and is undoubtedly a founding myth of the Berlin
                    Republic.</p>
                <p>Along with the New Berlin Republic, the political world has changed
                    fundamentally. The Soviet Union was swept away in revolution in 1991. NATO has
                    enlarged its membership; NATO has intervened militarily with Bundeswehr forces
                    to stop ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. Former Warsaw Pact members can hope to enjoy
                    some of the same freedom, peace and prosperity found in the Berlin Republic
                    today. Europe has adopted the EURO as its unified currency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While this revolution was going on, particularly at the
                        early stages, this was a time when the mobs were building up, over a period
                        of time these demonstrations and all, the scenario, all of us who were in
                        the Foreign Service and anyone else who I brought it up with, this was going
                        to happen, it was going to build up, there was going to be an explosion, the
                        East Germans have been trying to get out, the government will try to stop
                        them, the West Germans, with or without our consent are not going to let
                        this happen, they are going to maybe storm in or something like that, and
                        the Soviets were come in and World War III. So you are sitting there,
                        watching what in our old scenario was World War III beginning to develop and
                        the end of civilization as we know it. What were you reporting back? Were we
                        just sort of reporting, and was there anything come from Washington, or were
                        we looking at Soviet tanks and East German tanks, what was the Embassy
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: I can't speak for Washington, but at the Embassy we were inundating
                    the government with individual reports of what was occurring. There were
                    demonstrations on Alexanderplatz, which were put down by East Germans. We knew
                    that the National Volks Army was on alert but not engaged. We focused on the
                    connection between the Soviet army and the NVA, the East German Army. The
                    escalation steps were well known and the “People's Police” on the streets were
                    the first line of defense. If that line was breached, then you go to the
                    “Betriebskampfgruppen” or militia. The militia appeared during the Gorbachev
                    visit. The militia were mostly old guys in National Guard-like uniforms, they
                    looked like Army and they had Czech weapons as they were wandering around the
                    streets. These were the guys that had marched down Unter den Linden to set up
                    the Berlin Wall - the Anti-fascist protective Wall - in 1961. We watched them
                    appear on the streets and looked for signs of NVA deployments, however, we never
                    did see any Army on the streets. We wondered where the Russians were and found
                    them still in their barracks. Nevertheless, we were nervous. We were all very
                    nervous, but we watched that to the extent that seven or eight embassy officers
                    could have access to see what was going on. But we were the diplomats on the
                    ground and were right there to see all these demonstrations. We saw where the
                    chain of violence might occur and reported on developments daily.</p>
                <p>We did have some frantic questions from Washington. Once there were news-reports
                    out of Washington in the middle of the night. I recall being asked about a
                    confrontation with a Soviet tank in Bernau. Somebody obviously reported this
                    event but it was very hard to find out what had occurred. It took us a day to
                    find out that the mayor from the small town of Bernau outside of Berlin wanted
                    to move a World War II trophy tank that was on a pedestal in a downtown square
                    to some other sight. The confrontation was apparent Soviet dismay with the
                    mayor.</p>
                <p>There were reports of East Germans having fights with Russians near their
                    commissary, but they were Russians married to Germans. Those incidents turned
                    out as far as we could determine as domestic or personal quarrels, not political
                    incidents. Later there was another report in the middle of the night when I was
                    called by the State Department Operations Center about a group of East Germans
                    attacking a Soviet military installation in the Harz Mountains. I was in Berlin
                    and the Harz Mountains are not nearby and told the Ops Center the we would find
                    what we could. We usually talked to working journalist to expand our coverage of
                    events and our network of contacts. In this case I turned on the radio and I
                    heard a nighttime BBC report that had that part of the report, there was a
                    confrontation of East Germans with the Soviet installation in the Harz
                    Mountains. The report went on to say that this installation was a radio antenna
                    site and the East German was telling the Russians that some day this land will
                    be our country again. I called the Operations Center and asked if they want to
                    check that report as well and that seemed to settle that rumor. In reality, the
                    point was that we were very tense. We were doing little things to control
                    rumors, and reporting furiously on bigger things like the demonstrations and
                    debates inside the SED, trying to find any indication that we were crossing that
                    threshold of dissent to revolution and we were extremely nervous.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>Washington only began to wake up to the dangers of the changes on that night of
                    November 9. All the reporting that we have done seemed to have been swallowed up
                    ahead of time. Although I learned later that the President's morning briefer on
                    November 9 had reported to the President our assessment of the November 6
                    changes in the GDR travel law, which we said would make the Berlin Wall
                    irrelevant. Washington knew there were changes. In all honesty, we did not
                    predict a revolution, you couldn't have predicted a revolution. We didn't know
                    when the confrontation would happen, we simply tried to keep track of things.
                    But I tell you, after the 9th of November, Washington turned its attention to
                    every little event that was about to occur in East Germany.</p>
                <p>The next major political event for us occurred a month later when Secretary of
                    State James Baker came to West Berlin to give a speech on U.S. policy in Europe,
                    focusing on NATO, the EU and OSCE. At this point in November after the Wall had
                    been breached, we did a report to the State Department making some suggestions
                    of kinds of initiatives we could take to gain control of this situation and
                    Baker would include a restatement of our policy on German unification. We
                    suggested new initiatives; my favorite was to re-open our Consulate in Leipzig,
                    which was the heroic city of the demonstrations and symbolic of the coming
                    revolution with Nikolaikirche vigils and Maestro Mazur's timely intervention to
                    prevent violence. We had another advantage. As part of our rights negotiated in
                    our diplomatic recognition of the GDR in 1974, we agreed that the GDR could open
                    an office in New York and we would have the right to a second office in East
                    Germany. We also suggested initiating conversations with upcoming communist
                    leaders because we were waiting for a new leadership to follow Glasnost and
                    Perestroika, opening relations with the West.</p>
                <p>One of the suggestions we made was have Secretary Baker visit with the East
                    German leadership. By that time Hans Modrow, the friend of Gorbachev, was named
                    Premier and took office on 18th of November. We saw this appointment as an
                    opportunity to pursue Glasnost in the GDR and to find out if Glasnost and
                    Perestroika had a chance after Honecker. We argued that a meeting with Modrow
                    would be important. Never in history of the GDR had a US Secretary of State
                    visited the GDR. The highest-ranking official had been John Whitehead, Deputy
                    Secretary of State. So we would be breaking new ground in having a higher level
                    official visit and send the signal that the U.S. was prepared to do business
                    with a new regime. I called Jim Collins, one of Baker's Deputy Executive
                    Secretaries and my former boss from the Operations Center. I called him
                    repeatedly and told him that we really want Baker to come. We thought a visit
                    was just the right thing with the debate in East Germany moving toward free
                    elections. We argued that if the GDR had free elections, the communists would be
                    defeated. He told me that the argument in Washington was not so clear and warned
                    that if I wanted an answer immediately, the answer would be an emphatic “No!” I
                    accepted the wait and declined Jim's offer to keep the possibility of a visit
                    alive.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>Baker came to West Berlin on the evening of December 11th. Ambassador Barkley was
                    hosting dinner for Congressman Gephardt in East Berlin with prominent East
                    German leaders, including Deputy Premier Christa Luft. Baker called Barkley to
                    West Berlin to meet with him and he left the dinner. As his replacement I
                    enjoyed the lively conversation in his absence about supporting Perestroika and
                    Luft's proposal that the U.S. support joint ventures with GDR companies, of
                    course with 49% foreign ownership. Barkley's meeting with Baker included General
                    Walters, who was Ambassador Walters from West Germany. They discussed whether or
                    not the Secretary should go to meet with the East German leadership. Ambassador
                    Dick Walters had a very good argument in that he said if Baker went, he would be
                    seen supporting the communist leadership and reinforcing their hold on power.
                    Walters argued that Baker should not go to East Berlin. Barkley argued that the
                    new GDR leadership was committed to elections and if they have actually free and
                    fair elections, they are finished. Afterward the dynamics in the GDR will change
                    in our favor. Baker had a clear presentation from both his ambassadors in the
                    Germanies who were speaking really from the two very different perspectives.
                    General Walters speaking from the World War II and onward experience, a very
                    legitimate point of view, and Barkley from his experience of living in
                    revolutionary times when all politics were beginning to change. Baker dismissed
                    the two Ambassadors and then told Under Secretary of State Bob Zoellick to tell
                    Barkley that he would come to East Berlin after his speech the next day.</p>
                <p>When Ambassador Barkley came back to our dinner about 10 o'clock at night, he
                    pulled me aside and informed me of the Secretary's decision to visit the next
                    day. Our tiny embassy was to host the Secretary of State in East Germany he told
                    me. I was delighted, but quite aware that no secretary had ever been there
                    before and that we were short on time to find someone for him to meet. Barkley
                    and I conferred and I set about to find a host.</p>
                <p>We went over to the dinner table, adjourned for coffee, and Barkley asked
                    Modrow's deputy, Christa Luft, if she would call the Premier and ask him to meet
                    Baker the next day. Recognizing the validity of Walters' point of view, Baker
                    said that he also wanted to meet with the church leaders who were leading the
                    protests and running the revolution. I called Imre Lipping, who was covering the
                    politics of the churches and asked him to invite Bishop Leich of Eisenach. When
                    Imre called back and said the Bishop was unavailable, we called and made an
                    arrangement to meet at the Potsdam Nikolaikirche with Manfred Stolpe, who was an
                    East German church leader at that time and who later became Minister President
                    of Brandenburg. They both agreed.</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>Secretary Baker sent Karen Grooms to meet with us the next morning, we went to
                    the site visit. Anne Bodine, our administrative officer, and Karen put together
                    this visit in less than a day. The work may have been painful, but the pain was
                    short. It was really fun in a fascinating way. Baker had a speech in West Berlin
                    and delivered U.S. policy on the architecture of CSCE, of European Union and
                    NATO. And then he added a part, which we had also suggested, we'd hoped he would
                    even say something like German unification. One of the “back-channels” I had was
                    with the State Department Policy Planning Staff and most of my conversations
                    were with Jim Holmes on a secure line. Jim Holmes was clearly heard by Baker and
                    Zoellick and the policy planning office was influential in getting our message
                    to the secretary. Our request to restate U.S. policy in support of German
                    unification won Baker's approval, but he had four conditions. Among them were
                    continued German membership to NATO.</p>
                <p>Anyway, after his speech in West Berlin, Baker's motorcade, big Mercedes cars and
                    West Berlin police paddy wagons drove off with their big blue lights and sirens.
                    They arrived at the Glieneckebr�cke, this spy-exchange bridge, where Nathan
                    Sharansky, the Soviet dissident, had been exchanged as well as U-2 pilot Gary
                    Powers. The Motorcade stops and of course the West Berlin escorts cannot cross
                    over the bridge past the Soviet sentry. All of these impressive Mercedes police
                    cars and the paddy wagons had to stop and just the American cars go across. They
                    were met on the other side by the other German police car, the Wartburg, which
                    is a little tiny Fiat like thing that sported a little tiny blue light, maybe 20
                    watts. They drove up to the Interhotel Potsdam where Baker met with Modrow. I
                    met the party in the hotel, where I have chatted with Modrow. When Baker
                    arrived, Modrow made the point that Americans should support the DGR in
                    Perestroika. The East Germans wanted to make these changes, and promised 49%
                    joint ventures with American to get the economy going, which would be good for
                    all. Baker made one point in reply that after the GDR elections, we'll be glad
                    to talk to you about Perestroika. Baker then talked about U.S. support for
                    German unification and Modrow looked surprised and asked what about German
                    unification?</p>
                <p>As background I must say that Modrow had given his inaugural speech in the
                    Volkskammer on November 18th saying that perhaps two Germanies could have a
                    “Vertragsgemeinschaft,” a “contractual agreement” but not unification. Also on
                    28th of November, West German Chancellor Kohl had given a speech calling for a
                    confederation of German states, as an interim phase before discussing
                    unification. The United States seemed to be ahead of both German parties as they
                    were moving very quickly toward their own unification.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Between the time when the Wall sort of opened up and the
                        Baker visit, what was happening as far as, was the Wall open, were the
                        people going back and forth?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: The GDR over the weekend of November 9-12, 1989 agreed to open 20 or
                    more crossing points through the Berlin Wall. The next day, on November 10th, I
                    took Jean, our two kids and our dog down to Bernauerstrasse, where the sidewalk
                    was in West Berlin and the building was in East Berlin. The pictures of people
                    jumping out windows to freedom in West Berlin when the Wall went up were world
                    famous. That morning we started to cross the Wall with a long line of people
                    getting visas. The police were stamping visas for everybody, but since we had
                    our GDR pass and we could go back and forth through the other checkpoints, and
                    we simply proceeded through the Wall. We didn't get in line because we didn't
                    have our passports to obtain a visa. We walked through no-man's-land into West
                    Berlin, and as we crossed Carl, my son exclaimed that there we really two walls.
                    One was on the East Berlin side, which was three slabs of concrete laid sideways
                    on top of each other, then came the death strip, and across the death strip
                    plowed areas with raked sand, mines, sensors, razor fences and towers. There was
                    also a road for the guards to patrol the death strip. As we stepped into this
                    eerie area my son said, “Gee, there are two walls. Look at all this.” The West
                    Berlin, that Wall was one that you saw everywhere with its murals memorialized
                    was made of poured concrete with a big foot on it. That's the West Berlin Wall.
                    We strolled into West Berlin, where the people cheered. It felt a little
                    uncomfortable. We only spent a few minutes at a playground there where we let
                    the kids play for a while, then we came back. As we came back, the GDR guards
                    wouldn't let us pass into East Berlin. And they started arguing at this crossing
                    point that the promise was only for the GDR citizens. But we argued that we also
                    lived there, and I showed them my ID card. I said “Well, where do you think we
                    live? We live in East Berlin.” They then let us through. I told the story to
                    Ambassador Barkley; he tried it on Saturday and he had to go through three
                    levels of command before he could get back. The East Germans opened several
                    crossing points and activity then began. Film crews filmed the East Germans
                    euphoria of travel and openness with East Berliner going to West, lining up for
                    “Greeting Money” - a hundred marks - and the buying forbidden fruit, symbolized
                    mostly by bananas. You could buy bananas rarely in the GDR and bananas became
                    the symbol of the change. Walking down the Ku'dam, people got bananas. They
                    missed the whole revolution, and suddenly it was peaceful and people were coming
                    and going to West Berlin. Things began to change. In GDR cities round table
                    governments were formed to follow the Polish model placing local citizens along
                    with the SED functionaries together to govern. Of course, the rubric was on
                    renewing the GDR. There was never talked about revolution - revolution in German
                    is a dirty word. It's a very difficult, violent and destructive event. The
                    roundtable discussion was about the renewal of the GDR.</p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>However, just before Secretary Baker came to the GDR, just a few days before, on
                    the weekend of 7th-8th of December, one of West Berlin Mission Minister Harry
                    Gilmore's friends, and a West German SPD member visited Rostock, in East
                    Germany. He reported back to Harry that he had seen the roundtable there and
                    noted that city governments were collapsing. He really feared, as he told Harry,
                    that East Germany was on the verge of civil war. Harry did what every good
                    political officer should do, and reported this story to Washington. However, he
                    didn't give us the courtesy of informing us that he was reporting this report
                    about the GDR, nor did he comment in his report about the validity or meaning of
                    what was going on. Of course, he wasn't really in a positionto comment on
                    another country: he just sent the cable off to Washington. The lights lit up in
                    Washington at the National Military Command Center, the Ops Center, the White
                    House Situation Room and the CIA Command Center like you wouldn't believe. This
                    is the scenario painted of the Operations Plan for World War III, uprising in
                    East Germany - here it comes!</p>
                <p>When we got this cable and I called the political section - Jon Greenwald had
                    already left for home, and Emre Lipping joined me and Mike Mozur, the Economics
                    Counselor to give me an instant analysis of the West Berlin report. They wrote a
                    very long cable very quickly and did a great job of explaining developments in
                    the GDR. I took the report to Ambassador Barkley and we talked about how do we
                    present the analysis. We agreed that, “The only thing that counts is the
                    summary.” If we did not get the story right and Barkley argued that the current
                    draft was not right, it would not work. He turned to me to go back and rewrite
                    the summary. In a few short paragraphs I wrote “The situation in the GDR is
                    serious, the city governments are collapsing but roundtable governments are
                    taking over, and yes the garbage is still being collected and demonstrations
                    happen on Monday nights. The pace of this revolution is breathtaking.” Then I
                    sent the cable to Washington, hoping to reassure the government that World War
                    III was not breaking out, at least not yet.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>Before Baker left for Berlin, he met with the Washington Post editorial board. On
                    his way to the editorial board he stopped by the Operations Center, where they
                    gave him an update of overnight events so he wouldn't get blind-sighted about
                    crucial development. The Ops Center had seen our cable analyzing the prospects
                    for Civil War in East Germany and they gave him a copy. Now James Baker is a
                    very smart man, and he folded up this cable and put it in his pocket. Perhaps
                    that was not kosher, but it is a very smart thing to do because when meeting
                    with the Washington Post editorial board about his trip and NATO, they asked
                    him: “What are these reports about the deterioration, or unrest in the GDR?”
                    Being a smart politician as well, he reached into his pocket and said, “Let me
                    tell you what Mr. Barkley's Embassy in East Berlin has to say about this
                    situation.” He read the summary, and that ended the question. Obviously the
                    journalists took very good notes because the next day the summary appeared in
                    the Washington Post, almost verbatim. The following day it appeared in Neues
                    Deutschland, the communist newspaper in the GDR, on page 8, as I discovered
                    reading ND. I reacted immediately, “Good Grief, this is a translation, what's
                    going on here?” I ran over to Barkley, and I said “Look at this, this is our
                    cable.” I got on the phone, called the German desk. They said, “Oh, yes, didn't
                    you see that? We thought that was great.” “Well you didn't even tell me!”
                    Anyway, I guess it was the Secretary who released it, so it was okay. That was
                    what was happening between those periods, November 9th and December 12th.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think this is probably a good place to stop. So we
                        finished thBaker visit. And we'll pick it up after that.</hi>

                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is the April 8, 1998. J.D., again the Baker visit was when?</p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: December 12th, 1989 in Potsdam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After Baker left, what was happening? How was Baker
                        received?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: The conclusion was a great one. We had not anticipate much interest
                    in the press. The GDR was in its glory on November 9th, when the Wall came down,
                    and after that it seemed to have passed from the daily news as the revolution
                    spread throughout the rest of the Central Europe. However, the Secretary had
                    about 20 or 30 press traveling with him and much to our surprise as Secretary
                    went into his meeting with Modrow, the press gathered outside and it had grown
                    to about 130 of journalists. The Secretary came out and said “We have an
                    announcement to make, about open and free elections.” Modrow announced that
                    elections were planned for May 6, 1990. Then he tried to turn to a new debate.
                    However, Perestroika, Glasnost, the policies of Gorbachev were put on the back
                    burner. The focus was then on elections in the GDR. Would there be elections,
                    and if so, when. May 6th 1990, they were planned.</p>
                <p>Politics in January were working on two tracks. One was the unification track
                    that Baker had mentioned in the meetings. The U.S. was for unification; the GDR
                    revolutionaries were still for the renewal of the GDR. And Modrow in January, as
                    Premier Modrow and with the PDS, the Party of Democratic Socialism, ahead of the
                    pack on unification and renewal. And the event that had happened just before
                    that, if I may back up a bit to December 21st.</p>
                <p>On December 21st, the politics of unification really became apparent. West German
                    Chancellor Kohl had visited Dresden in East Germany on the 19th, for his first
                    visit. Baker had come on December 12th, Kohl on December 19th, and then on
                    December 21sPresident Mitterrand, all visiting East Germany. However,
                    Mitterrand's visit was a return visit for the state visit that Erich Honecker,
                    the GDR leader, had made to Paris. While we were promoting unification and Kohl
                    confederation, Mitterrand was promoting two Germanies. He had given a speech
                    just before that in Kiev, arguing the case for two Germanies, the British were
                    also for divided Germany and wished for two Germanies, which were better than
                    one Germany. My good friend, the DCM of the Soviet Embassy, Igor Maksimichev was
                    giving a speech, the same speech in several places, once at Aspen Institute
                    Berlin, talking about the rise of the Fourth Reich. So the U.S. was rather
                    isolated in politics around unification. Here was Mitterrand coming to East
                    Berlin, meeting with Egon Krenz, speaking at the University in Leipzig and then
                    hosting a Gala in East Berlin.</p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>Unfortunately for me the Mitterrand Gala was the same evening as the Embassy
                    Christmas party. We had prepared some good lyrical songs and we were going to
                    have a blast. I was invited to the reception for Mitterrand, but decided that as
                    much as I liked the Embassy party, this Mitterrand party would be a rather
                    interesting evening. I went to the Palast Hotel, which was next to the German
                    Cathedral of the Prussian Hohenzollerns, I walked in as Margo Honecker, Mrs.
                    Honecker, the Education Minister, assembled with other members of the Politburo.
                    The leader of the Communist Party was about to be chosen that night was there.
                    He was Gregor Gysi, the son of Klaus Gysi, the State Secretary for Church
                    Affairs who was an acquaintance of Ambassador Burns, was about to be named head
                    of the Communist Party. It was an exciting evening. As Mitterrand seemed to be
                    giving the PDS, the SED the follow-on party of democratic socialism reform,
                    socialists, support for the GDR as a separate State from the Federal Republic.
                    Mitterrand came gave his speech and didn't stay too long, but the air was filled
                    with excitement. A new party the, East German Social Democratic Party, had been
                    founded and the leader of the Social Democratic Party was there was well,
                    Ibrahim B�hme. Ibrahim B�hme was thought to be a real revolutionary, however, as
                    it turned out a few months later he was really an agent of the East German State
                    Security, or Stasi. The end of the GDR was beginning to become very clear. The
                    question then for us was, “Would it hold?” Could you avoid the questions of
                    civil war, as it had been raised just before the Baker visit? As the month went
                    on, the next day in fact a very important event happened on December 22nd.</p>
                <p>The Brandenburg Gate was opened for pedestrian traffic. There were crossing
                    points on both sides of the Brandenburg gate. Symbolically the opening was very
                    important, as the President, Richard von Weizs�ker, had said often, “As long as
                    the Brandenburg Gate remained closed, the German question remains open.” And
                    then suddenly on December 22nd, the Brandenburg gate was open, as soon as
                    Mitterrand had left. Resolving the German question was on the political agenda.
                    What happened in January was fascinating, because...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But let me stop at this point J.D. Was there any debate
                        within your group of the people you were talking to, on the American side
                        and then others, at this sort of Mitterrand time, would say, “What's that
                        for the U.S., maybe it's a good idea to keep Germany divided?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: You know, that was an interesting question, and I thought there would
                    be more debate. But once Baker had made his speech, President had endorsed
                    unification, there was very little visible debate that we could as least see
                    sitting in East Berlin. It seemed that the President had taken a leadership
                    decision, in spite of what the British were saying and their concerns, the
                    French and their concerns, the Russians, they all seemed to be historical
                    concerns. President Bush focused on our commitment to West Germany, the
                    democracy that had been built up and the fact that we'd had something like 15
                    million soldiers in West Germany. It seemed to be that constituency in the U.S.
                    that he touched, it was very strong and powerful one, and there wasn't very much
                    debate about the U.S. supporting German unification.</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>There were others that did object to unification. I met during this period twice
                    with the Brussels representative of the World Jewish Congress (WJC), Maram
                    Stern. He met with the East German Foreign Minister Fischer, raised concerns
                    about German reunification and encouraged the East Germans not to move so
                    quickly. This lack of support for German unification became of course a serious
                    point of contention later when the GDR record became available and known to
                    Chancellor Kohl. Some years later when asked about the WJC and unification, Kohl
                    revealed the contents of the conversations between the World Jewish Congress and
                    Fischer. Kohl's relations with the WJC were soured in a very important way as a
                    result. But despite the efforts of people to delay and the concerns of others to
                    prolong the division of Germany, events on the ground were moving very
                    quickly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Everyone was being behind the times, things were taking
                        over. Traditionally we think of the French as playing the spoiler and just
                        going off in the different track, but we generally agree with the British
                        and the British may have wanted to move a little slower. Was it the feeling
                        that the French were playing the usual spoiler role or was this more serious
                        than that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: The power of European historical experience was very evident in all
                    of their arguments. There was a very deep, deep, deep concern about a powerful
                    Germany in the center of Europe, uncontrolled, not a part of a greater element
                    in itself. Even in our own pronouncements, if you look at Secretary Baker's
                    December 1989 speech and you will find that we conditioned our support for
                    German unification, particularly on Germany remaining in NATO. Giving Germany a
                    place in Europe was a very strong theme that ran through the entire debate. For
                    us, NATO, for Germany, for Helmut Kohl, the answer was the European Union or how
                    to embed Germany in European Union. Chancellor Kohl, during the debates that
                    came after the Fall of the Wall, made several concessions of German sovereignty
                    in order to have Germany have a place in Europe. Most important one perhaps in
                    this point in history was his decision to propose German economic monetary union
                    to become a European monetary union, which led to the introduction of a new
                    currency, the “Euro.” Kohl put European monetary union on the table; he didn't
                    negotiate it of course until much later.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: In January we faced many very fascinating events. I knew Prime
                    Minster Hans Modrow well and his leadership was key to the events. He was a
                    member of the PDS, Party of Democratic Socialism, which was the successor to the
                    Communist Party in Germany. Modrow was a very close friend of Gorbachev, with
                    whom he vacationed. Modrow wanted a separate East Germany, although in his
                    opening speech to the Volkskammer, the Parliament, he called for a confederation
                    or what he called for a “Vertragsgemeinschaft” with West Germany. It could be
                    literally translated as “contractual community or federation” of German states,
                    a point that Kohl picked up on later, on November 28th when he talked about his
                    “Ten-point Plan” for German reunification. In January however, there was a surge
                    in popular support for Modrow prior to the GDR election, and he hoped that this
                    popularity would help him win those elections. However, Modrow made what I
                    considered a fatal error; he decided to not abolish the internal state security
                    system, the Stasi office that kept track of everyone. He decided, based on an
                    argument that every country had an espionage fighting secret service, that one
                    element of the hated Stasi, the Staatssicherheit, needed to remain, although the
                    internal security mandate would be curtailed. The new office would be the
                    external arm of the Stasi, renamed the “Amt fur National Sicherheit.” The moment
                    he took that decision, the political support he had been building simply
                    evaporated.</p>
                <p>After his support disappeared, stability of the GDR was again threatened and by
                    the end of January, he advanced the date of elections to March 18, 1990 from his
                    call for elections for May 6th, as he had informed Secretary Baker only a month
                    earlier. Modrow's support was waning and his ability to carry on the campaign
                    was slipping away. Modrow needed to have an earlier election so that he could
                    have a chance to continue governing.</p>

                <p>Fascinating events began to occur with increased rapidity. People began to doubt
                    the stability in the GDR. The next brilliant move to exploit the opportunity, if
                    I may say so was done by Horst Teltschik, who was the West German the national
                    security adviser to Helmut Kohl. On the first weekend in February, as the
                    Chancellor was planning to go visit Gorbachev, Teltschik declared that East
                    Germany would be unable to pay its bills within 24 hour“Die DDR wurde
                    Zahlungsunf�hig... Of course, it was a rather stark assertion, based a little
                    bit on fact, but a brilliant political move, because it brought into question
                    the entire financial situation of the GDR. Not so much for the GDR, which was
                    teetering on bankruptcy since 1983 when Franz Josef Strauss bailed them out with
                    a one billion-mark loan, but for Gorbachev. Chancellor Kohl did not need to pose
                    to Gorbachev the question: “Will you pay for the GDR?” Teltschik's question in
                    the press posed it for Kohl before the Chancellor visited Gorbachev. During that
                    visit Gorbachev told Kohl that German unification was a possibility that could
                    be acceptable in Gorbachev's eyes. The shocking news for us was that Gorbachev
                    even talked about unity of Germany. The existence of the GDR was based entirely
                    on a sovereignty that grew out of the military force of the Soviet Union, and
                    Gorbachev's musings of German unification were devastating blows to the GDR.
                    East German leadership, including Modrow could only understand that Gorbachev
                    would not use the Russian military to sustain the GDR. That conclusion was read
                    everywhere and accelerated the process of unification dramatically. I was at a
                    conference of the Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik in Pullach when the
                    announcement of Gorbachev's statement came over the television. Immediately, the
                    Germans in the room grasped the significance of the statement and were jubilant.
                    Horst Teltschik won my greatest admiration for his daring statements that had
                    dominated our conversations. I had to content myself in responding to Michael
                    St�rmer's demands that we open our consulate in Dresdethe heart of German
                    culture, not in Leipzig. Jim Dobbins, Deputy Assistant Secretary was at the
                    meeting and called on me to defend my decision in favor of Leipzig, which I
                    defended easily as Leipzig was the Heroic City of the unfolding revolution.</p>
                <p>About the same time, President Bush was meeting with leaders in Ottawa for an
                    open-skies conference. There the unification policy was born. That policy was
                    directed from Washington, and we watched the results of the revolution move from
                    our hands in East Germany to the capable hands of Secretary Baker, Dr.
                    Condeleeza Rice, Robert Zoellick, Bob Blackwill and Phil Zelikow, who were
                    working with their counterparts in West Germany. After the March 18th election
                    when the East German revolutionaries were elected, they joined in the
                    negotiations as well and the talks became known as the “Two plus Four
                    process.”</p>

                <p>This reference to the Four Allied Powers that were victorious in World War II and
                    were responsible for Berlin and Germany as a whole, reminds me of an incident
                    that occurred in West Germany, in West Berlin. In December, just prior to
                    Baker's Berlin visit, Ambassador Walters, seeing that the situation was very
                    unstable, took an initiative to call the four Allied ambassadors responsible for
                    Berlin - the U.K., France, the USSR and the U.S. - to get together. He proposed
                    meeting to discuss an on-going topic the “Berlin Initiative” at the old Allied
                    Kommandatura building, in West Berlin which hadn't been used since 1948 when the
                    Soviets marched out. The four Ambassadors arrived and had their picture taken,
                    which appeared in the press. They didn't have much discussion, but the symbolic
                    value of the four victorious powers of World War II meeting to decide the faith
                    of Germany was too much. West German Foreign Minister Genscher was furious and
                    I'm sure, although I wasn't part of it, I'm sure he shared his ire with Mr.
                    Baker.</p>
                <p>That led to the question who will made the decision about German reunification,
                    and in the open-skies meeting that was taking place in Ottawa, formulation was
                    proposed by Genscher that we should call this process “Two plus Four.” That is
                    the two German states would take their sovereign decisions and the four
                    victorious powers by the right of the conquest in the World War II would
                    participate in that process. The agreement itself would become a surrogate for a
                    peace-treaty with Germany. There in Ottawa, the U.S. along with its other allies
                    launched the “Two plus Four” unification process. Embassy East Berlin was
                    brought back into the picture to support the Washington-based talks.</p>
                <p>On March 18, 1990, Lothar De Maizi�re, Christian Democrat, was elected the first
                    and only democratically Prime Minister of the GDR. Marcus Meckel, SPD and a
                    Lutheran Minister, was named Foreign Minister. De Maizi�re was of the CDU, Mr.
                    Meckel was a social democrat and Meckel chose as his deputy Hans Misselwitz. I
                    had met Hans Misselwitz in Washington in 1988 when Hans came as a guest of the
                    United Christian Church. He had been a chemist; however, he had decided he was
                    too revolutionary to be a chemist and so he couldn't have a career in chemistry.
                    He had changed careers and had just completed his studies at a theological
                    seminary. He was married to Ruth Misselwitz and he was able to take a year with
                    the United Christian Church and had come to Arlington, Virginia, where he was to
                    study for a year. The East Germans forbid travel to the U.S. by his wife and his
                    children. We met several times at the home of a German pastor, Berndt Wrede, in
                    Arlington, Virginia, and we had some wonderful conversations about the dissident
                    movement in the GDR, which served me well before I went to East Berlin.</p>
                <p>After the March 18th election Misselwitz was State Secretary in the Foreign
                    Ministry. We had many conversations and I had open access to the East German
                    Ministry of Foreign Affairs during the 2+4 negotiations to discuss East German
                    positions, however, the U.S. government saw little role for the GDR negotiators.
                    This was due in part to their inexperience and their desire to take Polish
                    positions to the table as their own. Washington talked almost exclusively with
                    Genscher.</p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>Marcus Meckel the GDR Foreign Minster, the first, last and only democratic
                    Foreign Minister, had unification ideas that were really not in tune with the
                    rest of us. This is 1990, before the Soviet Union disappeared, before the Warsaw
                    Pact disappeared. Although the GDR was withdrawing from the Warsaw pact in order
                    to join the rest of Germany, Poland was still in that orbit. Misselwitz and
                    Meckel tried to engage with their Polish friends, with whom they had a
                    revolutionary period in the Solidarity movement and had worked very closely, and
                    as they came into more power they wanted to put the Polish agenda on the German
                    unification talks. We did not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is this the border firm between Germany and Poland?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Actually, you raise a very interesting question. The Polish-German
                    border was unsettled. In fact, all of Germany was unsettled, the borders of
                    Germany were from 1937 and became one of the key issues decided in “Two plus
                    Four” talks. The decision was Germany would be made up of three parts, that is
                    West Germany, East Germany and Berlin. The Germans were to renounce their claim
                    to those parts of Poland, which had been Germany. Those parts of Germany that
                    were under the administrative control of the Soviet Union since the end of the
                    war, that is K�nigsberg, or Kaliningrad, were left outside the three named parts
                    of united Germany. At some point at the next ten or twenty years this issue of
                    the status of Kaliningrad will come back again. We know that in the “Two plus
                    Four” agreement Kaliningrad is not part of Germany but we also know that it
                    isn't a contiguous part of Russia. Corridors, like that from Russia through
                    Lithuania - the Danzig Corridor or the Berlin Access Routes - have always caused
                    problems. The Danzig corridor that played a role in World War II, the Berlin
                    corridor that played a role in western access to West Berlin and in German
                    unification. The Russians have to now drive through Belarus or Lithuania to get
                    to their territory there in Kaliningrad. But I digress.</p>
                <p>We saw many events around “Two plus Four” as very important events.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you getting from the people you were talking to
                        from our Embassy in Bonn, about the role of Genscher? Did Kohl and Genscher
                        seem to be on the same path or was one leading the other? How was that
                        duality viewed?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Our Embassy in Bonn and our Embassy in Berlin were worlds apart.
                    Communication between the two Embassies took really place through Mr. Zoellick,
                    or Mr. Blackwell, whenever we were informed. There was very little direct
                    discussion. I participated in as a staff member, not at the table, in the “Two
                    plus Four” meetings that took place in East Berlin. But having served in Germany
                    many years I knew many people and with two of them we talked informally to keep
                    track of what was being said. The East Germans were running their government but
                    had to ask what Genscher was doing and why he did what he did. The basic East
                    German contribution was to make the 2+4 agreement possible in the first
                    instance, not in the details of unification.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling about Genscher that you were picking
                        up?Was he a driving force?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Genscher was certainly a driving force and the strongest drive that
                    he tested, although it never went very far, was to insure German unification by
                    considering not having Germany in NATO. This idea was bandied about and was
                    quickly shot down, but it was out there as an idea that could be perhaps
                    resurrected at some point and it made us very nervous.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to say, that would have made everyone nervous,
                        because this would have meant a Germany with its own armed forces, a
                        powerful Germany not under any sort of overall control.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Exactly. Our policy was built on the idea that although Germany was
                    sovereign and could decide its own fate, however, we expected that they would
                    find their fate with us in NATO. Alternatives to German NATO membership were
                    very unsettling; that view was shared throughout Germany. Other issues, more
                    fun. Once when we had “Two plus Four” negotiating session in East Berlin with
                    Bob Zoellick. We had a very interesting “Two plus Four” discussion at Schloss
                    Niederschonhausen. I was fascinated by our equally unbending approach to the
                    Russians, whose rigid positions seemed so out of place. The presentations were
                    very stiff and formal with little movement from any position. The fun came
                    afterward. Mr. Zoellick wanted to visit the headquarters of the East German
                    Army, the NVA (Nationale Volksarmee), and meet with the Minister of Defense, the
                    newly elected democratic Minister of Defense, Mr. Rainer Eppelmann. Mr.
                    Eppelmann and his NVA were headquartered in Strasbourg outside of Berlin because
                    Berlin was “demilitarized” by the victorious powers from World War II. I had the
                    task to escort Zoellick from East Berlin, through the GDR to Strasbourg, a
                    circuitous route that was very time consuming. We followed the archaic Allied
                    Power rules governing the divided city of Berlin, which in Berlin meant that
                    Westerners had to leave Berlin from West Berlin, go out into the GDR, go all the
                    way around Berlin and come to Strasbourg, rather than cutting through town. We
                    were precluded from entering the GDR from East Berlin under these rules because
                    there were no checkpoints marking the end of Berlin and consequently East Berlin
                    appeared to be part of the GDR although the Allies refused to give recognition
                    to East Berlin as the capital of the GDR. Such was the theology in “Berlinery.”
                    We followed the rules, however, in order to make sure we arrived in Strasbourg
                    in time we asked for East German police escort. Unlike the police escort that we
                    thought we were going to get, we got a very conscientious policeman, or one who
                    wanted to torpedo the visit. He drove a little less than the speed limit, which
                    made us somewhat late, then he took us on what he thought to be a shortcut but
                    it turned out to be a dead end and then we had to double back, and by the time
                    we got to Strasbourg, Mr. Zoellick was steaming of course. Minster Eppelmann was
                    also steaming and has just left without seeing Zoellick. It was a very
                    instructive point about end of Berlinery. At least from Mr. Zoellick's point of
                    view these rules were finished, he would never travel under them again. We went
                    straight back through Berlin to West Berlin. And indeed, the passing of
                    Berlinery had started and would have a direct impact on how we were operating
                    after the Fall of the Berlin Wall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for how the East Germans, were they
                        left differential towards the Soviets, were they looking after themselves
                        all this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: After the democratic elections, the East Germans were looking to the
                    Poles, to the West Germans to define their role. They were basically told by the
                    West Germans what to do and were not able to get any international support for
                    what they were doing. But there were fun events in this time of transition.
                    Speaking of Strasbourg reminds me of the visit by Jim Woolsey, who was at that
                    point negotiator for the Conventional Forces in Europe negotiations. He wanted
                    to go to the same headquarters of the East German Army that Zoellick had
                    attempted to visit. This time we were more successful. We arrived on time. We
                    did the same Berlinery theological logistics all the way around Berlin, but we
                    got there on time. We went into the NVA headquarters and were met by the East
                    German colonels in uniform, who escorted us into the conference room. There we
                    met with a young, 20-something year-old State Secretary Marzinek, who was a
                    revolutionary, although he had served in the NVA. He and Mr. Woolsey had a
                    correct and pleasant discussion, as these East Germans Officers looked on in
                    bewilderment. They clearly were baffled and uncertain about this American
                    Ambassador talking directly to their State Secretary; it had never happened
                    before. Jim Woolsey tells the story to this day. It was really funny. Strange
                    world was coming, the world was coming apart, that's really what we were
                    experiencing. That the old no longer fit, it was still in place, were would that
                    world go?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting a feeling at all from East Germans, were
                        they concerned about their role in the former government, particularly
                        Stasi, was this beginning to make people nervous?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Absolutely. The nervousness increased as we got closer and closer to
                    unification. However, the democratically elected Volkskammer decided to open the
                    Stasi files themselves. They passed a law and began the process of historical
                    examination that led in some cases to recrimination, but the process was an
                    historical examination. After unification the law was passed again in the
                    Bundestag creating the same law into law for all Germany. So that historical
                    review process began already in the first months of unification. There were
                    expos�s of people like Ibrahim B�hme, the leader of the social democrats. Yes,
                    there were scandals. Ron Brown had come and visited us at this time...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was Secretary of Commerce.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: He was later Secretary of Commerce. He and his son wanted to see some
                    of these revolutionaries and I took him out and we went to a church basement we
                    met some revolutionaries, including Wolfgang Schnur. Unfortunately, Schnur
                    turned out to be a Stasi agent! I later found that such revelations were common.
                    Several of the people that I dealt with, in fact, somebody working at USIS,
                    Steven Laufer, who had been also a speech writer for Berlin Governing Mayor
                    Diepgen, claimed to be a South African, turned out was not only Stasi but was
                    actually an agent for the KGB. He was working at the Press Section in the
                    American House in West Berlin. There was always the question of who worked for
                    the Stasi. In the Embassy itself, our employees were all from the
                    “Dienstleistungsamt” or the DLA, the East German Labor Office. Every one of them
                    reported to State Security, and as unification was nearing, many of them
                    confessed to us that they were reporting to the Stasi. Of course, they did it
                    only because they had to if they were to keep their jobs. Others were
                    embarrassed, some quit and disappeared, some denied that they ever did anything
                    to harm us. Our own household staff told us almost immediately that they were
                    interviewed regularly about what we were doing, what we said, there were
                    wiretaps on our phones and so on. Stasi surveillance was very much a part of the
                    fabric of life and it was a very serious problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was our Embassy in Berlin, were you feeling more and more
                        a kinof observer to things that were happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Yes, the Embassy was very much sidetracked in fomenting or supporting
                    the revolution. The Embassy in East Berlin never really was able to play much of
                    a role domestically except on occasional interventions in unification process.
                    But what we did do is report on events with our analysis and work with
                    Washington to support the unification process. We worked closely with the
                    democratically elected Prime Minister to GDR Lothar De Maizi�re. We brought the
                    highest U.S. visitor to the GDR, Secretary Baker. Although he had come to visit
                    under the old government, he helped move the elections forward and supported
                    unification. We tried to work very closely to get a visit with President Bush,
                    which was not possible. However, we were able to win an invitation for De
                    Maizi�re, the democratically elected Prime Minister, to visit President Bush.
                    Working with Robert Hutchins, at the NSC's European Office, we worked very hard
                    to arrange visit and talked about how to win GDR support for the 2+4 talks
                    outcome. We wanted to recognize not what the Embassy had done but rather what
                    the East German revolutionaries had actually achieved. They elected a democratic
                    government with a mandate for unification with Germany. President Bush in June
                    of 1990 did receive Prime Minister De Maizi�re in the White House and made the
                    right point that the U.S. recognized not only the West German role, but also
                    what the East Germans had done to achieve the end of division of Germany. I was
                    very pleased as we saw the end of division of Europe that we had recognized some
                    of the revolutionaries that helped make it possible. This was a very important
                    symbolic message that was overlooked in the shuffle of papers moving through
                    June 1990, which was a very important month in German unification.</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>At the end of the month German economic monetary union took place, where East
                    German currency was abolished, and exchanged for German, D-Marks at three
                    different exchange rates. In the night of June 30-July 1, armored cars moved
                    through the quiet streets of Berlin with police escorts, sirens screaming.
                    Overnight the D-Mark was delivered and at effective rate of 1.8 East marks to
                    the D-Mark. The D-Mark put East German industry out of business overnight. The
                    conversion raised prices way beyond the market value of anything the East
                    Germans could produce. It gave some cash to individuals, their savings were
                    converted at 1:1. The used car market was exploding, you could make a lot of
                    money selling used cars, computers and stereos. It also sealed the fate of East
                    Germany. There was no economy left, East Germany was disappearing on the way to
                    unification. The NVA military was free from the Soviets, but had no role. The
                    place really was unraveling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought that you all in Berlin would have
                        been following the economy very closely, because if all of the sudden the
                        so-called independent country loses its currency, as was in those days,
                        today with Euro coming in it's a bit different, but in those days that's as
                        much sovereignty as you could possibly give up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Absolutely. And we did follow events very closely; we reported on the
                    effects of what was happening. We reported on collapse of companies and efforts
                    to deal with the debt issues of companies, which were converted at the same
                    exchange rate, including debt. As a result companies couldn't sell anything and
                    their debt was higher than they could ever repay. We spent a lot of time trying
                    to work with them to see what could be done to support new investment. We did a
                    lot to try to see if American business would be interested.</p>
                <p>In the postal, area, as they moved through unification, East German Postal
                    Minister, Fischer I think was his name, proposed the idea they keep East German
                    postal system, which also included telecommunications, separate for ten years
                    from the Bundespost in order to modernize it. We had 15 or so American companies
                    absolutely clamoring to get into that piece of Germany, to bring in cellular and
                    digital phones, to bring in fiber-optic cable, to move this new Germany into the
                    21st century and to have a piece of action. The Federal Post Ministry in West
                    Germany was, however, much stronger and in negotiations this idea was squashed.
                    In fact I received an irate phone call from Mannesmann which had an American
                    company as a subcontractor, very irate, screaming at me, what I was doing trying
                    to cut them out of the market and so on. To which I could only explain that we
                    had 15 American companies that were willing to do things other than lay copper
                    cable which is what they still had in stock and they started to do until they
                    ran out. Nevertheless, the Germans combined the two postal services into one
                    postal area, and kept our companies out at initial stages of unification. It
                    caused a lot of bad blood in 1990 period. But yet, we did follow the economy
                    very closely.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we as aware during this period before of how almost
                        abysmal the production of the GDR was? Or was this beginning to surface,
                        because we always thought of the GDR as being a crown jewel of Soviet Block
                        economy and that kind of blinded our eyes to what was being produced, or how
                        was that dealt with at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: The state of the East German economy was fascinating. The first fact
                    was that the people ate well; they had cars and they had electricity and they
                    lived better than anywhere else in the Soviet Union. The second fact was that
                    all statistics, including environmental statistics, were all top-secret. That
                    secrecy covered everything from industrial production to public health; all
                    statistics were kept secret. We, the West, were then shown the exemplary
                    examples of East German productivity. With its secrecy the GDR had in this
                    totalitarian system, they simply controlled information, which prevented a
                    transparent examination of the economy. There were a few industries, which were
                    really stellar industries, for example the computer-chip industry. Honecker
                    touted the expertise in the computer field by praising the manufacture of a
                    microchip, which was ridiculed privately as “the world's largest microchip.”
                    Nevertheless, it was in that industry, right at the time of 1989 revolution that
                    the GDR had been able to reverse-engineer a 386 IBM computer. I visited the
                    factory and met with the engineers after unification and they were very proud of
                    their achievement. It was the GDR, as they asserted, that kept all the Soviet
                    component parts for East Bloc computer systems working. Despite the West's
                    export control regime, Coordinating Committee (COCOM), they had been able to get
                    access to Western computers and the technology to crack the system. However,
                    such successes were exceptional. In more traditional industries we knew the
                    situation was much worse. The roads were deteriorating and were generally in a
                    bad shape. The railroads and the two automobile companies were of poor quality.
                    Factories spewed out effluents damaging the environment. Waldsterben, death of
                    the forests, was a great concern. But as long as all of the data was classified,
                    some of it “Top Secret,” our analysis was something that was based on
                    intangibles. The intangible that made East Germany work was “Vitamin B.” Vitamin
                    B, stood for “Beziehung” or “contacts” and was a kind field expediency to
                    correct problems but was not evident. For example, you could not see them take a
                    shovel and make a plow out of it. You couldn't see it. You couldn't see
                    bartering trade that would bring things from the West to get in the crucial
                    materials that you needed in order to keep producing. The system only worked on
                    “Vitamin B,” on contacts, personal relationships, that were everywhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Italians call this Vitamin B “arrangiarsi,” which
                        means “tmake arrangements.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: That's it! But if you're an economist, you simply can't say “I don't
                    have any statistics, however, I have seen a couple of really great examples of
                    economic efficiency. Anecdotally, this place works.” Unfortunately, that was the
                    basis of much of our economic calculations. The East Germans knew that they had
                    a 2/3rds economy, not some economic miracle.</p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>One joke circulated at the time along these lines:</p>
                <p>East German manager meets a Japanese manager (at the time the powerhouse economy
                    was Japan.) The East German expresses his awe and admiration for the Japanese
                    economy and asks the Japanese manager to lift the cloud of bewilderment and tell
                    him the Japanese secret. The proud Japanese manager looks and the forlorn East
                    German and declares: “Our secret is quite simple. We work one-third of the time
                    for ourselves, one-third of the time for our company and one-third of the time
                    for the Emperor.” “Eureka,” exclaims the East German manager, “Now I understand.
                    We, too, work one-third of the time for ourselves, one-third of the time for our
                    company and we have no emperor!”</p>
                <p>Of course when the unification process took place, there was much more
                    transparency. We started seeing these dismal factories and we said, “How does
                    this work? This is a factory built in 1880 and it's still using the same
                    equipment! I wonder why the Soviets didn't take it with them!” And then we saw
                    that the special cases were few. The monetary unification took place and the
                    Vitamin B relationships disappeared. There was no way that they could barter and
                    the economy began to collapse. When we came to look more closely at the economy,
                    we did not see the “Beziehungen” that had kept it together. The relationships
                    simply weren't there. And then we were roundly criticized; the criticism was,
                    “How could you ever believe that it anything could ever work in such an economy?
                    This is stupid you didn't see this disaster coming.” Well, it wasn't stupid, it
                    was a closed society, cloaked in secrecy and functioning on this field
                    expediency. We made the best analysis based on very limited knowledge and
                    defended our efforts. Of course, we should have seen, we should have known more,
                    but we didn't, and when the collapse came it came very rapidly and very deeply,
                    and the place was very much shut down. Some of the collapse was also induced by
                    the introduction of the D-Mark, which converted East German debt into hard
                    currency that none of these companies could pay. That currency conversion
                    contributed to the collapse of the East German economy, even when none of us
                    mourned its disappearance.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time, we're up to the summer of 1990, was the
                        Embassy sort of trying to play catch-up, where things happening so fast...?

                <p>BINDENAGEL: As a matter of fact, it was a fascinating time. Since humor often
                    reflects reality better than analysis, let me recall two jokes that were
                    circulating at the time. One was a reference to Otto von Bismarck. During the
                    fall of '89 and through the spring of '90, events were happening so fast that
                    the present was blurred. The comment on the time was: “Bismarck said; 'When the
                    world comes to an end, we will all go to Mecklenburg, because everything happens
                    there 100 years later.'" We heard that comment and said, “Okay, what's happening
                    in Mecklenburg?” Indeed, Mecklenburg is a distant province in the North where it
                    is quiet and often behind the times. My ancestors came from Mecklenburg-Vor
                    Pommern.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That being in East Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Yes, it was an East German State. The quote offered us a perspective
                    on time. As demonstrations were taking place in the fall of 1989 we watched
                    those in Leipzig in particular. It was a fast-paced and very exciting time in
                    Leipzig, in Dresden and even in Plauen, a small border town of 50,000 people
                    where some 100,000 demonstrators gathered one night. East Germany was literally
                    exploding with demonstrations. When we looked at Mecklenburg in that period of
                    September-October 1989, we were astonished to see demonstrations had already
                    appeared in Mecklenburg. Recalling the Bismarck quote, we made a little
                    calculation and said, “If two weeks after the big demonstrations in Leipzig,
                    there are demonstrations are in Mecklenburg, then two weeks equals a hundred
                    years. Maybe the world is indeed coming to an end.” That was the feeling that we
                    had as we watched the end of the Cold War.</p>
                <p>The speed of events was like being on a video, watching yourself on a video stuck
                    on 'fast forward'. Fast forward was stuck for months. When you went to sleep by
                    the time you woke up the next day, your world was totally disorientated. I must
                    have asked myself daily: “Where are we in this movie, where are we in this
                    play?” Each day I needed to find my spot just to know where to hop back on into
                    the movie. The movie kept on moving, all the way through the summer.</p>
                <p>All activity was not revolutionary however. On the other hand, in the summer of
                    1990 we had begun working with George Ward, Embassy Bonn DCM, to structure a new
                    Embassy office in Berlin. We cut some positions and we set up the staffing
                    patterns. Of course I knew that after unification, my position as deputy would
                    be redundant, because obviously the deputy in Bonn would be the deputy for all
                    of Germany. But because there were so many things going one we thought that the
                    unification wouldn't come until January of '91, and that there would be a few
                    administrative things that needed to be dealt with as we tried to put these two
                    missions together. That was a mistake on my part.</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>I went to California to visit my in-laws, with my family, we came back in late
                    July, early August. In the meantime Saddam Hussein had invaded Kuwait on August
                    2nd. Why was that important? It was important because in the GDR all of the
                    Middle Eastern terrorists had bases and were working from GDR. One time after
                    the democratic government was elected, I went to visit the Interior Minister of
                    the GDR, with an official visitor about the East German involvement in the
                    LaBelle Disco bombing in West Berlin. [Interior] Minister Peter-Michael Diestel
                    was sitting across the table and we were talking about terrorists and the
                    LaBelle Disco bombing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the bombing of a nightclub in Berlin by the
                        Libyans, some 10 years before.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Exactly, the bombing was in the mid-1980s and at least one American
                    was killed. We were looking for the information on the Libyans, because they,
                    like the Iraqis, were operating from East Germany. Our conversation about the
                    LaBelle Disco bombing, went well. Later, the Germans worked closely with me to
                    arrest and convicts several people involved in this terrorist act, but that's
                    another story.</p>
                <p>Diestel, the Minister, and his East German policemen, who were still part of this
                    Stasi organization, suddenly sat back and said; “I have a report it's an
                    interesting one. You asked about terrorism and we have a more recent, a new one
                    to report.” He went to the next room and asked someone to bring him that report.
                    He put down this report in front of me and said: “Since the outbreak of the Golf
                    War we've been getting these reports in here is one of them. This is a report of
                    a Middle Eastern-looking person driving a West German rented car, filming a
                    residence, casing a place. We suspect that he is setting up an assassination.”
                    And I replied: “Can I see the report? I would be very interested.” I looked at
                    the address, and the address was my house. I asked the minister, Mr. Diestel,
                    “Would you mind if I had a copy of this report? This is where I live!” He said,
                    “Of course not” and gave me a copy. I alerted our security people and at that
                    point my life in East Berlin changed. Under threat our West Berlin colleagues,
                    who had treated us in communist East Germany as second, poor cousins apparently
                    felt some pity on me. For my remaining time in the last few days in the GDR, and
                    gave me a partially armored car to drive around in. We also undertook some other
                    security precautions because timing of the threat was linked to the U.S.
                    invasion of Iraq. My children remember vividly this time because I would no
                    longer say goodbye to them at the front door as I had done even through the
                    revolution. I simply did not want them exposed to danger if an assassination
                    attempt was made as I left the house.</p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>One most rewarding decision taken by the Department of State before the GDR
                    disappeared was the creation of a new consulate in Leipzig. Ambassador Barkley
                    proposed opening a Leipzig consulate right after the fall of the Berlin Wall and
                    before Baker's December 1989 visit to East Berlin. He wanted to take the
                    initiative on several ideas and one of those was opening a Consulate in Leipzig.
                    We suggested opening a Consulate in Leipzig or better said, reopening the
                    consulate we had in Leipzig until 1940. That consulate was started with an
                    American of German descent, Frederich Liszt, who was from Recklingshausen. He
                    had emigrated to the U.S. because of his radical pro-capitalist views. While in
                    the U.S. he learned railroad business from Harriman. And then he came back to
                    Germany with the title of Consul. He wanted to find a job where he would be
                    recognized as U.S. Consul. He tried Berlin, but was rejected. Then he went
                    tLeipzig where his main activity was building the first railroad between Leipzig
                    and Dresden. He became the first American Consul. We thought there was a
                    historical connection, which was nice, but more important, opening the consulate
                    was a way of saying, “Thank you, here are the heroes of 1989 revolution, heroic
                    city of Leipzig.” Leipziger went to the streets in the thousands and hundreds of
                    thousands and brought down the communist system. We wanted to be on record of
                    having said “America stands for those who demand their freedom.”</p>
                <p>The Department of State decision was not so easy. We had already argued for a
                    decision in November 1989 and had no answer. Luckily a friend of mine, Bill
                    Inglee, from the House of Representatives, where I had been a Congressional
                    Fellow, visited East Berlin in January 1990. This staff member and I were
                    talking and I told him about his proposal for a Consulate in Leipzig. He said,
                    “that's very interesting. We should have that, that's a very good thing.” So in
                    February 1990, Secretary Baker was testifying before the House Foreign Affairs
                    Committee, and Bill had written a question for Mr. Baker, and the question was,
                    “Mr. Secretary, are you opening Consulates in Bratislava, Kiev and Leipzig?”
                    Bratislava had been a major discussion, “Kiev” had also been under discussion
                    for a very long time, but Leipzig was apparently new. The Secretary's response
                    was, “Leipzig?” with a big question mark on it. But since the transcript came
                    out with a period, I got immediately a call from the East German Foreign Office
                    saying “you're opening a Consulate in Leipzig, are you?” They had received the
                    message and they understood immediately why we were doing this, “You are doing
                    this because of the demonstrators!” “Yes, we could do that” was my reply. We had
                    no problem opening a second office in GDR, because in 1974 when we negotiated
                    diplomatic recognition of East Germany, the GDR wanted an office in New York. We
                    conceded that point to get the title to our property on Pariserplatz next to the
                    Brandenburg Gate. This person from the East German Foreign Office told me
                    immediately, “No problem, I understand you have the right to have a Consulate.”
                    So we began the process of finding the Consulate, getting the State Department
                    to say “yes,” since the Secretary had said “yes,” so to speak. The State
                    Department didn't like this idea, and they didn't understand it. They said, “Why
                    are you trying to open a consulate in Leipzig?”</p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>Jim Dobbins came to Germany where I saw him in Bavaria. He was Assistant
                    Secretary by then in the European Bureau. We had this conference and Michael
                    St�rmer, a professor from Ingolstadt, said, “Why are you doing this Consulate in
                    Leipzig, you should be doing it in Dresden, that's the heart of Saxony, heart of
                    Germany as well, that's where all the activity is?” Dobbins turned to me and
                    said “You explain it, it's your idea!” So I explained that we were trying to do
                    it for political statement and that this is a very important one, we had a
                    Consulate there before and wished to send a political message in support of
                    freedom. Dobbins stated that the Department of State would approve this
                    Consulate in Leipzig, but we will review it in six years. Meaning, in
                    administrative parlance that the State Department would close it in six years
                    because Germany will be united and we won't need Consulates any more.</p>
                <p>Another highlight that I had was regaining the title for the U.S. property at
                    Pariserplatz. I went over to the East German Foreign Ministry on the request of
                    the State Department administrative side, for a copy of our tittle to that
                    property. The Director General, Mr. Neumann, came to the Embassy. He had never
                    been to the American Embassy. This was after the elections and I received him in
                    our small visitors' room for his presentation of the title of that property next
                    to the Brandenburg Gate, Pariserplatz 2. He was nervous about his own future and
                    talked of his cabin in the woods where he would retire. He showed me the city
                    plan of Berlin with the surrounding property near Pariserplatz. I was excited
                    because we could rebuild our Embassy in the heart of united Germany, I hope.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had we been trying to do anything about these terrorists,
                        middle Eastern and other terrorist who had been trained in East Germany? Was
                        that a bone of contention or not? Even prior to all these things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Prior to the democratic election of March 18, 1990 the GDR would not
                    entertain any discussion with the United States on such matters. We raised the
                    La Belle bombing after the change of government because we attributed the
                    bombing directly to the GDR. We had tried to discuss the issue for years, but
                    they had gone nowhere. What we didn't know was that the West German terrorists,
                    who had killed American soldiers and many leading German politicians and
                    businessmen, were being harbored by the GDR. After unification these terrorists
                    were exposed. Terrorism became a very serious problem for us but we really had
                    very much success.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do things play out here? We're towards the end of
                        '90?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Right. By end of 1990 we had opened our Consulate in Leipzig (in
                    September 1990). German unification came on the 3rd of October, along with it
                    the pink slips from our own government as East Germany disappeared and the U.S.
                    Embassy closed. I left few weeks later. Ambassador Barkley left almost
                    immediately, because this country had disappeared and he really had no role. And
                    after getting my own pink slip from the head of our Mission in West Berlin,
                    Harry Gilmore, I left shortly thereafter returning to Washington in January. I
                    left in November, took a short leave and reported for duty in January.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the general feeling about whither Germany with
                        this East Germany when you left?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: There was a lot of optimism that unification would bring prosperity
                    to the former East Germany. There were no regrets at the passing of the
                    communist dictatorship. On the night of German unification there was a huge
                    celebration in downtown Berlin. In Embassy Berlin we had a party ourselves, an
                    awards ceremony for our troops that had delivered so much during the revolution.
                    We had a lot of meritorious honor awards and other awards were given out. And
                    then as the night wore on, the real jubilation was on the other side of the
                    Brandenburg Gate at the Reichstag, where the Chancellor raised the German flag.
                    Jean and I walked from the U.S. Embassy to the GDR after the party through the
                    Brandenburg Gate surrounded by the cheering crowd. I felt a great sense of
                    accomplishment tinged with anger at the clumsy way my own colleagues from West
                    Germany dismissed us in the East, as if we were tainted by serving in a
                    communist country. We sensed that the tremendous satisfaction and hope of
                    unification, and the idea that in a few years West German capital and East
                    German capability would make Germany united, wealthy and rich. Our own treatment
                    foreshadowed the dashing of hope that occurred over the next five years.
                    Revolution swept away the communists, but soon other problems would become very
                    difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During these events was there much interest on the part of
                        Congressmen or in a way had it sort of fallen of the screen and they were
                        looking at sexier places or something? How did you feel about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: For a brief moment we were in the spotlight. Congressmen came in
                    droves. We must have had 90 Members of the House and 30 or 40 Senators, coming
                    in the period between the fall of the Wall, the 10th of November to March when
                    the East Germans voted. Several of them were very influential and wanted to see
                    for themselves before they decided on own opinions and own conclusions about the
                    revolution, unification and the future of Europe. A couple of them were really
                    fun.</p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>One was on December 2nd, 3rd, 4th 1989, when Senator Pell led a Senate Foreign
                    Relations Committee delegation to Berlin. We met them at the airport, there were
                    a number of Senators. Senator Garn was there; I don't remember them all. We
                    brought them to the Ambassador's residence for a relatively small we had a
                    dinner planned. We could accommodate only a small group including the Senators,
                    two staff members, two people from the Embassy (the Ambassador and myself) in
                    order to maximize the guests from the East German Foreign ministry and many of
                    the revolutionaries that we'd known. Gathering all these people in the same
                    place made for an absolutely delightful time, rather like the round-table
                    government that was taking over the GDR. We lost several of the communist
                    guests, particularly members of the Volkskammer and Politburo who did not come.
                    We were very disappointed that they didn't come, we had counted on them to help
                    us understand the gravity of the revolution. There were other communists and the
                    Foreign Office types, but not the members of the Parliament. What we learned
                    however was that there was a special session of the Central Committee to revise
                    the Constitution, deleting the monopoly of the power of the communist party in
                    the GDR Constitution, as an effort to save the communists. It was a desperate
                    act, doomed to failure. For us we lost our guests, but it was a fascinating
                    time. Congressmen, Senators interacted with the revolutionaries and communists
                    who did come. I joined in a conversation with Senator Garn and Schorlemmer, a
                    radical who regaled us with stories of the revolution.</p>
                <p>The next day the Congressional Delegation had a whole set of briefings in West
                    Berlin and then on Saturday night about 11 o'clock Senator Lugar's assistant,
                    Ken Myers called me. I had been unable to accommodate all the staff at the
                    dinner and they were rather upset. In fact, when I announced that we had only
                    two seats for staff at the dinner one of them told me that I would never be
                    confirmed for anything because they would remember for as long as they lived
                    that I had prevented them from attending the Ambassador's dinner. In an effort
                    to make peace, Senator Pell asked that I come and join them on Sunday. Of course
                    I accepted. They were in West Berlin and were going to take a tour of Berlin. I
                    joined them on their tour bus, the ten Senators or so, and we toured a little
                    bit of West Berlin before crossing Checkpoint Charlie. There, as we crossed into
                    East Berlin, the Army major, was giving them a Cold War U.S. Army talk about
                    divided Berlin. The briefing could have been dated in 1965, and had no relevance
                    to anything that had happened in the last few weeks of revolution.</p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>So I took the microphone from her and said; “Would you mind if I continued? I
                    would be delighted to conduct the rest of the tour.” While they wanted to go see
                    the house where the capitulation of World War II had been signed, I agreed that
                    that site was interesting. However, I suggested that en route we had to see the
                    sites of the revolution. We had to go to Alexanderplatz, where I told them about
                    demonstrations that took place on Alexanderplatz; how the East Germans marched
                    down the main street, Unter den Linden, past the Parliament VolkskammePalast der
                    Republik building. As they moved toward Martini church en route to the
                    Brandenburg Gate, the demonstrators heard “To the Gate.” I only saw this three
                    times myself, but there where all kinds of demonstrations, where the
                    provocateurs in this crowd, not revolutionaries, would say “To the gate!” I
                    surmised they were provocateurs because the Brandenburg Gate, near our Embassy,
                    was guarded by police who filled trucks waiting for the confrontation. It was a
                    set up, and the police we preparing to confront the demonstrators and brutally
                    take care of them. However, the leaders of the demonstrations, ministers and
                    some demonstrators themselves, were able to force the crowd to stop and turn
                    into the big parking lot, in front of Honecker's office, sit down and light
                    candles.</p>
                <p>I wanted the Senators to hear these stories, such as how the Fernsehturm, the TV
                    tower, had for several weeks jammed news reports of the West Berlin radio
                    station of 100.6, who's very conservative news programming angered the GDR. I
                    wanted to take them to the Gethsemane Church, near Sch�nhauserallee. There I
                    said; “Here at this church were the Monday night Lutheran vigils for the
                    political prisoners in the GDR who were held as demonstrations continued in
                    Berlin. I recalled the day, October 7, 1989 that Gorbachev had said to Honecker,
                    'Those who come too late will be punished by history.' After Gorbachev's comment
                    the same evening there was a demonstration at this, the Gethsemane church, with
                    thousands of East Germans. The East German police that had moved against them
                    with clubs, dogs and trucks with snow shovels on the front to disperse them. I
                    wanted the Senators to get a sense of the revolution that breached the Berlin
                    Wall.</p>
                <p>We went to a few other places before heading out to the Soviet military district
                    to see the Museum where the Nazi's signed the capitulation. As we were driving
                    along Karl Marx Allee, suddenly a policeman stops us, stops all the traffic, and
                    I thought; “What have we done now?” I got out of the bus, went over to the
                    policeman, and I said with a tone of authority; “What's going on here?!” He
                    replied rather sheepishly: “It's not my fault, we didn't do it, we had nothing
                    to do with it.” At this point, I saw people coming up from the underground
                    walkways, and lining up to block the street. It dawned on me immediately. Ruth
                    Misselwitz, the wife of the soon-to-be State Secretary in the democratically
                    elected GDR and also pastor at the Pankow Lutheran Church, had told me couple of
                    weeks before that she was helping to organize a 'human chain' of protestors from
                    the northern part of East Germany all the way to the Alps. She said the theme
                    was “Renewal of the GDR.”</p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>What we were witnessing as the people poured out of the ground was this human
                    chain. I rushed back to the bus and said, “I'm sorry about the delay, but if you
                    want to see a demonstration, let's go right now. If you come of the bus, we will
                    be able to go talk to these people and see the revolution in progress.” I
                    worried only a moment. At that point if it was going to be violent it was going
                    to be violent, but it wasn't. Senators and their staff were engaged with these
                    people and trying to understand. They asked: “Why are you out here, what are you
                    doing?” The demonstrators were lighting their candles, but remained silent,
                    because they are supposed to be silent. Everyone was taking pictures. The human
                    chain began at noon; at 12:15, the demonstrators disappeared; they just went
                    away. It was amazing. All the organizing had been done by the word of mouth, and
                    there were millions of people there that day. Reluctantly, we climbed back on
                    the bus and went to this house of capitulation. The Nazi capitulation was an
                    anticlimax, after seeing the revolution in action.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure it was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: I redeemed myself with the staff; I guess. [laughter] Those were
                    really the kinds of events that were pouring out all the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came back to Washington and you check in to
                        European Affairs, what sort of reception did you get? This is a loaded
                        question, so often when people had been in the eye of the hurricane, or
                        whatever you want to say the point of the charge for something, you get back
                        to Washington and there really isn't much effort to debrief people for what
                        they learned. I was wondering if that you experienced that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: It's a story I tell only reluctantly. The European Bureau did not
                    return me to the State Department, they refused orders. I signed a waiver
                    accepting financial responsibility for my shipment while the Department of State
                    sorted out who would pay for my return. I needed to get my family back to enroll
                    my children in school in time to complete a semester without losing a semester.
                    I returned to the State Department and reported to Personnel for duty. They sent
                    me the administrative office of the Economics Bureau, EB/EX.</p>
                <p>When I went into the personnel department, they said “Do you have your orders?” I
                    said “No, I don't have any orders.” They found the orders in the file and they
                    said, “oh, oh, well, oh.” Embarrassingly they said I had been identified for a
                    position they couldn't fill and had assigned me without consultations. They gave
                    me the orders and sent me to see the Director for the European Bureau Executive
                    Office, EB/EX, who took one look at me and said, “You can grieve this
                    assignment, you don't have to accept this.” I said, “If in its wisdom the State
                    Department wants me to do this job, I will do it.” We're talking about a year
                    assignment and I understood service discipline. Besides I had just had the
                    assignment of my career and there was no way to top it.</p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>The job was an office director for trade with developing countries, as far away
                    from Germany as you can get, far away from everything I had previously
                    experienced. The office was a mess; I could see why people didn't want the job.
                    Nevertheless, I worked diligently for several months, little less then a year,
                    working on getting the developing countries in the NAFTA agreement, particularly
                    Mexico. Doing some other things, it was very fun time.</p>
                <p>There was no interest in the European Bureau in debriefing me or even in talking
                    to me. I would describe the time more as an exile from my previous assignments,
                    than an interest. Since I was unassigned for the next summer, I had applied for
                    a training assignment, the senior seminar. There was one position left for and
                    FSO-1, but it was given to charg� for Baghdad. Disappointment followed
                    disappointment but eventually I was assigned to an executive exchange program.
                    Apparently I was too senior and there were no positions, however, Deputy
                    Secretary Eagleburger intervened and was assigned to work for Rockwell
                    International for one year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you ascribe this were you on somebody's list or was
                        this just, the Department, you know, if your country goes down the drain
                        essentially, you're just a problem. Looking at this with some, I would hope,
                        maturity and distance, what would you ascribe it to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Some of the problem was being off cycle (the embassy closed on
                    October 3, 1990) and not being able to be placed, there were not many jobs left.
                    Second is that during the revolution there were a lot of reports that people in
                    Washington did not like what the Embassy in East Berlin was doing. I frankly
                    ignored them because I assumed the grumbling was from envious colleagues. One of
                    them was award the Department of State Distinguished Honor award; I received a
                    superior honor award. We kept the Department fully informed and I also spoke
                    almost daily with Jim Holmes, in the Policy Planning staff; I assumed a direct
                    line to S/P caused some consternation in my own bureau. I know that in dealing
                    with the incidents on October 3-4, 1989 with the asylum seekers in the Embassy,
                    when I closed the Embassy that I had angered some people. I don't know why the
                    decision was taken not to return me to the European bureau. I think it was a
                    combination of a lot of things. I know that there was some personal animosity,
                    lack of jobs, availability of hard to fill jobs. In the end the European Bureau
                    had no commitment to its people in East Berlin. That was the hardest thing for
                    me to deal. There was no commitment to placing people who had done, what I
                    thought was a good job.</p>
                <p>I was treated as if, we who served in the East were the part of the communist
                    camp, as if we had been the part of the problem, as if we had been on the East
                    German side during the “two plus four” negotiations. We were apparently
                    tainted.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This happens sometimes. Earlier it manifested itself when
                        people were kidnaped or held hostage. There was a great effort on the behalf
                        of the Department to change that attitude because the original attitude was,
                        “Well, you should have gotten yourself taken hostage in the first place.”
                        This was very much the case. It's funny, because I ask the question not
                        knowing, but from my many other interviews and the personal experience, I've
                        seen when you come back from the most trying thing, often there just isn't
                        any interest.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: I was personally very angry, exceedingly angry for about a year. Not
                    so much that I didn't have a job, but I felt very mistreated and that my family
                    had to bear the brunt of the treatment. On the other hand, coming back last
                    September (1997), after having been a charg� in Germany for a year and a half, I
                    also did not have an assignment. I was asked to be a Deputy Assistant Secretary
                    in the European Bureau, but priorities changed and another person was given the
                    job. Promises, promises. In 1997, I felt much better about the treatment. I did
                    learn not to expect the commitment to reward excellence. Excellence is its own
                    reward.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm not sure when you say the problem of closing the
                        Embassy iOctober, you're talking about October 1990?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: No, the incident was in 1989. That was when the children, the
                    escapees, the asylum seekers sought refuge in the Embassy and we negotiated
                    their safe emigration from the GDR.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were in the Economics Bureau, what did you feel
                        was youmajor function?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: We had several trade issues, there were some questions of general
                    schedule preferences, and we had trade framework agreements that were negotiated
                    with Americans who were in other Latin American countries. We had business with
                    [Alejandro] Foxley, Finance Minister from Chile, basically was working on
                    developing countries, the Caribbean and South American trade problems. It was
                    not particularly rewarding, but the work was very important. The NAFTA agreement
                    negotiations took place that time and we played role in that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: North American Free Trade Agreement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Right. I played a role in the automotive talks, disome energy talks.
                    It was an interesting time but sort of a sidelight.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went to Rockwell for what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: I spent a year there where we did some strategic marketing with
                    Soviet Union. In fact, the day I arrived the coup d'�tat attempt had taken
                    place. Soon after that the Soviet Union collapsed. Rockwell had done a lot in
                    aero-space of course and so did the Russians and they had a project for an
                    Ilyushin aircraft transport plane that they needed western engines, they got
                    Pratt and Whitney engines, and they needed avionics, which Rockwell had. That
                    was one project I participated in. There were some other scientific things;
                    science was very good in the Soviet Union. Also worked on some of the
                    relationships that they had with the Germans, with Daimler-Benz, and tried to
                    create some business opportunities there with JPATS joint patrol on training
                    aircraft that they were proposing. How to present it to the US. It was kind of
                    fun. Rockwell didn't win that contract...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You finished up at Rockwell when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: I finished in the fall of 1992. I have to come back to individuals in
                    the State Department that count. Tom Niles had been my office director when I
                    was a desk officer in the Central European Affairs Office before he was
                    Assistant Secretary. He knew me and how I had been treated. What goes around
                    comes around, we also said. Tom Niles asked if I would be a Office Director for
                    Central Europe - Germany, Austria and Switzerland. I said yes, it was a very
                    good way to come out of exile if you will and come back to Foreign Service. I
                    had a chance to do some really good work. President Bush was still there and we
                    had an aviation agreement that was being negotiated, of course we had the
                    American elections that fall. I enjoyed plunging back in and seeing what had
                    happened in the year and a half that I had been away from Germany. Not very
                    long, but nonetheless, a lot had happened.</p>
                <p>There were many really very interesting events that took place after January of
                    1993 when the Clinton Administration was sworn in. I had been working in the
                    fall of 1992 on the return of the Berlin Documents Center records, BDC, which
                    were the party records of the Nazi party captured by U.S. Forces at the end of
                    World War II. Tom Niles, when he was office director in 1980-1981 had negotiated
                    an agreement to microfilm all of the Nazi records in the Berlin Document Center.
                    This project was finished and the National Archives was to receive a complete
                    microfilmed copy. While I was preparing to return these originals documents to
                    German Federal Archives, Richard Holbrooke was named Ambassador to Germany.
                    Shortly afterward, I went to a meeting in Jerusalem on German-American-Israeli
                    relations, and while in Jerusalem New Yorker magazine ran a story about the
                    return of BDC records, including an interview with Ambassador-designate
                    Holbrooke. Of course the story did not come out exactly with the facts as I saw
                    them, but rather ran along the line that the U.S. was giving this American
                    property away and the Nazi records will be lost to us. Consequently, I was faced
                    with the question that scholars would never be able to do research again in
                    these records because of my irresponsible action.</p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>The story was picked up by House of Representatives Member Tom Lantos, who was
                    Hungarian survivor of Nazi concentration camps, and a Congressman from
                    California. He took article's assertion as the truth and denied the State
                    Department comments were truthful. He was saying; “You can't turn the documents,
                    you have to consult the Congress,” which we had done over the years. The
                    decision was to implement the agreement from the 1980s. Nevertheless, Lantos
                    called for a Congressional hearing, which included very contentious
                    presentations about what we were doing. I was also called before the Office of
                    the Inspector General to determine whether we were disposing of U.S. Government
                    property properly. Both the hearing and the IG determined we were acting
                    correctly and we returned the records to the German Government.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like something that should have been taken care
                        of. Was it just a political temper tantrum or something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Yes, the incident showed the showed tremendous political sensitivity
                    about issues from the Nazi-period. I say this because this historical period
                    keeps returning as an issue for me personally. The other event that occurred in
                    April 1993, the opening of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. I had helped
                    approve a piece of legislation when I was on the desk with Tom Niles and John
                    Kornblum as directors. The legislation in 1983 had created the U.S. Holocaust
                    Memorial Council. That lead to grant of land on the Mall and the creation of
                    Holocaust Memorial Museum. The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum opening was in
                    April. Just before April, the new Administration had come into office...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about the Clinton Administration, '93.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: ... and Secretary Warren Christopher's first speech in February was
                    on the war in Bosnia. We needed to do something in Bosnia. The whole debate on
                    Bosnia had swirled around about what the UN should do and NATO should do, what
                    the U.S. should do, whether it should be considered an internal or international
                    conflict. Bosnia dominated the early political discussion. At the same time, the
                    German Defense Minister, Volker R�he, gave a speech on March 26 in London,
                    calling for NATO expansion for new countries, East-Central Europe. Bosnia and
                    NATO expansion became mixed together, and I started to see in my own work that
                    we were going to deal with them in the context of the Nazi past. We had a very
                    interesting beginning of the Clinton Administration, from the Office of
                    Central-European Affairs.</p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>The opening of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, was an occasion for the Museum
                    to invite more than 20 heads of state, heads of governments to visit, mostly
                    from Central Europe, the Balkans and the Baltics. At the opening ceremony they
                    had planned to have Elie Wiesel, a famous Holocaust survivor, give a speech. The
                    Museum deemed the invitation to the government officials as a private
                    invitation, and the Museum was organizing the opening event without help from
                    the State Department. They insisted their event wasn't an official government
                    meeting in Washington, although the Museum is a government institution. The
                    Clinton Administration was new and Tom Niles, as the assistant secretary was the
                    official responsible for all the countries invited to the Museum. He commented
                    that this is really a Holocaust issue, and it belongs to the Office of Central
                    European Affairs, and assigned me the duty to help deal with this 20 or so
                    EasEuropean heads of government, who wanted to see the new president. I assigned
                    David Straub to work closely with the Museum on a program to include a reception
                    at the White House and a group meeting with the President, with a photo
                    opportunity, for the visitors.</p>
                <p>At the White House reception, President Clinton in his first days in Office, was
                    gregarious as ever and started having individual conversations with these
                    people. It was raining outside where the reception was held. It was April, cold,
                    rainy, and hot. The reception was supposed to be two hours, three hours into the
                    reception these people hadn't come outside yet. We all wondered what they talked
                    about. They talked about Germany's history, Holocaust, they talked about Russia,
                    they talked about where they sat between these two great powers that had fought
                    over their territories and they pleaded for a seat at the table at NATO. They
                    wanted to be a part of NATO. President Clinton told his National Security
                    Advisor Tony Lake to take this issue on and see what could be done.</p>
                <p>Part of the reason the Holocaust and NATO enlargement emerged from the Museum
                    opening was derived from Elie Wiesel's speech at the Holocaust Memorial Museum,
                    particularly since he was a survivor of the Nazi concentration. Wiesel spoke of
                    the Holocaust and said there was another Holocaust beginning in Bosnia. He
                    called on the U.S. and the heads of governments to act. He was telling the new
                    President that he needed to do something. This event presaged my very
                    interesting involvement in NATO enlargement.</p>
                <p>Richard Holbrooke was named Ambassador to Germany in June, 1993 and he sought to
                    define a whole set of new issues. He had issues for me to consider: What do we
                    do with Bosnia, what do we do with NATO? What do we do with Central Europeans on
                    our watch?</p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>I had already called the Embassy in Bonn, to ask the political counselor, Don
                    Bandler, about the R�he speech to determine whether the Defense Minister's talk
                    on NATO was German policy? Do they really want this expansion, and if they are
                    launching this initiative, what are they going to do about it? The answer back
                    was, “Oh, no, that was just a speech by the Minister.” I said, “Well, ask the
                    Chancellor's Office, ask the Foreign Office, ask the Defense Ministry.” The
                    answer comes back, “Just a speech.” What do you mean, it's just a speech? What
                    is he trying to do? Answers would come later. In June, Senator Lugar gave a
                    speech on NATO enlargement. He, too, had questions about what should we do with
                    the problem in Bosnia. Suddenly we had an unofficial speech of the Defense
                    Minister of Germany and the another from the Republican Senate opposition party,
                    a very senior foreign policy spokesman for the Republican party saying, “NATO
                    enlargement.” Meanwhile the fighting in Bosnia continued. We did not have the
                    answer to the question about what to do in Bosnia. We had not defined a role for
                    the U.S.</p>
                <p>The Germans don't have an army that could be legitimately deployed in conflict
                    outside Germany. That is, the Bundeswehr had never been used in a conflict. The
                    German domestic political debate is deeply involved in a serious of questions on
                    sending their ships or German Navy sailors to participate in sanctions against
                    Serbia in the Adriatic. The debate is also legal and is expected to go to court
                    as the issue develops. Another related issues was whether the FRG could send
                    their crews on AWACS (Airborne Warning aircraft control ships) aircraft to fly
                    over Hungary to monitor the NATO sanctions against Serbia? Hungary was
                    particularly difficult because it was a former communist country and member of
                    the Warsaw Pact. The court did not decide early on the issue; the German
                    Government decided the Luftwaffe could fly such missions, but the F.D.P.
                    coalition member had brought suit in court against the decision. Of course, the
                    Luftwaffe had not been deployed in a combat at time when their defense minister
                    proposed NATO enlargement. These security issues in the post Cold War world was
                    all very confusing and hard to deal with.</p>
                <p>Diplomacy is a mixture of policy papers, briefing memos and speeches that lead to
                    decisions. Steve Oxman, the new Clinton Administration Assistant Secretary for
                    Europe gave a speech to the Atlantic Council in August 1993. As Assistant
                    Secretary foEuropean Bureau his speech would be an important step forward in our
                    policy make. Working with Oxman's speech writer, we put in a few questions that
                    Senator Lugar had posed earlier in an attempt to see if the Atlantic Council
                    meeting, which included press, to see if the debate on NATO enlargement was ripe
                    for discussion. We learned that the focus was still on Bosnia, not NATO
                    enlargement. Steve Oxman then went to a North Atlantic Council (NAC) meeting in
                    Brussels, to talk about what kind of U.S. participationshould an IFOR, an
                    international force under the UN, have.</p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>Then the action on new security structures shifted in the next few months over to
                    the Pentagon and Frank Wisner, who was Under Secretary of Defense. He was
                    invited for a regular meeting with his counterpart, FRG Defense Ministry State
                    Secretary Jorg Schonbohm. The meeting took place in the German Ministry's Berlin
                    office in the Bendler Block, which had been the headquarters for the Wehrmacht
                    and sight of retribution killings for the failed coup against Hitler in July
                    1944.</p>
                <p>Wisner and Schonbohm met for their annual high-level group consultations and
                    Ambassador Holbrooke went and I also attended. The meeting was also in
                    preparation for the upcoming Travemunde Defense Ministers meeting. The topic was
                    of course Bosnia and the military forces necessary to meet the challenge. The
                    State Secretaries were looking for an initiative for the defense ministers and
                    they came up with the idea of Partnership for Peacekeeping in Bosnia. The
                    meeting was quite remarkable and lasted late into the night. I was the only
                    State Department attendee as the military had its long nearly all-night
                    discussions on Partnership for Peacekeeping initiative. In the meeting agenda
                    for Travemunde with Defense Ministers loomed large. Consequently, the Defense
                    Ministers announced their initiative for Partnership for Peacekeeping as a way
                    to deal with the Southeast and Central Europeans, but not to let them into NATO.
                    Defense was not ready to discuss NATO enlargement, and they thought that this
                    initiative of “Partnership for Peacekeeping” would fix the problem, even as it
                    became Partnership for Peace. Indeed the debate was deflected as questions about
                    framework agreements and work-plans enveloped the players and moved the issues
                    inside in the bureaucracy. The delay was not long, however, the NATO Summit
                    which was slipped from December to January 1994, took up the issue, reaffirmed
                    Article 10 of the Washington Treaty, and started the debate again that NATO
                    certainly could have new members. NATO enlargement did not stop the bureaucracy.
                    From January 1994 almost all my work on security issues was on Bosnia and
                    Partnership for Peace designed to answer questions about engaging more countries
                    in PfP, and about preventing NATO participation in UN mission. Let the IFOR do
                    its job under the UN and keep NATO out of the process; that was the game
                    plan.</p>
                <p>The Germans were arguing for a new role for the Bundeswehr. In the Gulf War in
                    1990/91, they didn't even want to participate. They paid a lot of money in the
                    Gulf War, but now said the FRG would not just pay a lot of money. They argued
                    that they were either in or out. Again the domestic, internal political debate
                    heated up on the issue. As we then moved through the spring into summer, the
                    Germans were still having their back and forth debate, but had reached no
                    decision. The AWACS decision was being tested in the court.</p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>Ambassador Holbrooke arrived in Bonn in October 1993 and remained until July
                    1994. In October I was chosen as his deputy, however, he told me to stay in
                    Washington and be his deputy there while he made the acting deputy the Embassy
                    Economics Minister his temporary DCM for this eight-month period. This was the
                    ambassador's management style to have several “deputies.” It was a very
                    interesting constellation of star FSOs. Personnel management issues were
                    interesting, but the FSOs worked very closely together. The NATO enlargement
                    debate, which had been announced in January was not moving forward. The German
                    political elite weren't playing ball: they wanted Bundeswehr to evolve, but were
                    very nervous about the German army's historical role, especially in the
                    Balkans.</p>
                <p>We lived through this debate to June when the planning for President Clinton's
                    visit to Berlin became our main pre-occupation. He was going to meet with the
                    U.S./EU summit leaders and then have a bilateral meeting with Chancellor Kohl in
                    Berlin. In addition, we were going to have a whole series of events, including a
                    major speech and a “Farewell” visit to the Berlin Brigade, because in September
                    their mission to protect divided Berlin would be accomplished. The Berlin
                    Brigade did a super event with the troops, a fly by in helicopters with little
                    parachutes with candy dropped to remember the airlift of 1948.</p>
                <p>But more important, was the President's meeting with Chancellor Kohl. They met in
                    the Reichstag and while the meeting was still on going, the German
                    Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe, Germany decided the AWACS issue. Germany
                    could be part of an international military force, the court decided. I received
                    the phone call while we were sitting outside in the ante chamber outside the
                    meeting of principals, wrote a little note saying the court had decided Germany
                    could participate in an alliance to deploy outside of its borders with
                    parliamentary support and gave it to Andrew Friendly who was an assistant to the
                    President. Andrew intercepted the President as he and Kohl were going to the
                    press conference after the U.S./EU summit. They started off the press conference
                    and President Clinton made a reference to the court decision; he was pleased
                    that Germany could be a full partner and he wanted the Germans to be a partner.
                    The first time in my life that I had heard Chancellor Kohl say anything in
                    English came right after that. He said in German at the beginning, “This does
                    not mean...” and then he said in English “...Germans to the front.” We were all
                    little taken back, not because of English but because off what he was saying.
                    The answer was that the Germans were partners, but they would not send troops to
                    the front though. That dynamic was clear that we would need a high-level push to
                    success. Ambassador Holbrooke was able to keep the pressure on after that very
                    good visit with the President.</p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>The President walked after that with Chancellor from the Reichstag, one block
                    down the road and turned from the West side of Berlin to the East. He walked
                    under the Brandenburg Gate, into the eastern part of Berlin, up to a podium
                    where he gave a very short, exceedingly short, five-minute speech. In it, he
                    among other things praised the Germans for their civil courage, referring in
                    part to the East German revolution, but more recently to the demonstrators
                    against right wing violence, neo-Nazi violence that had taken some lives. He
                    called on the Germans to maintain their “Civil Courage.” He stated that “Alles
                    ist moglich.” He assured the Germans there in the heart of reunited Berlin that
                    the U.S. would stand on Germany's side, “Now and Forever.” Then we drove through
                    the city. There were people everywhere. The numbers according to crowd control
                    officials were tens of thousands, maybe 80 or 90 thousand people. The whole
                    speech event was very uplifting. The President then went on to the “Rotes
                    Rathaus,” the City Hall in East Berlin. None of these places had been visited by
                    a sitting American president since they were in the former East Berlin.</p>
                <p>After the Presidential visit, Ambassador Holbrooke come back to preside over a
                    very important initiative in German-American relations, a new emphasis on
                    commerce and culture. I say “we” in sense that as Holbrooke's deputy my job was
                    to be creative and proposed ideas. After we discussed them and he chose what he
                    wanted, the program was certainly his. One of his greatest ideas was a “New
                    Traditions” Conference, recognizing that the military presence was declining
                    rapidly in Germany, therefore and the rising need for Germany to be a partner of
                    the U.S. in commerce and culture. We pushed very much the business and cultural
                    connections with the U.S. Holbrooke's New Traditions Conference brought together
                    40 or 50 CEOs from the U.S. along with German CEOs, Chancellor Kohl, Secretary
                    of Defense Perry, and Defense Minister [Volker] Ruhe. Holbrooke had a commitment
                    from Vice President Gore to come, however, he tore his Achilles' tendon and we
                    received him on interactive video. The theme of the meeting was new traditions
                    in business and how do we keep the relationship alive and vibrant.</p>
                <p>NATO enlargement also played a key role. In Holbrooke's effort to push for NATO
                    enlargement, he had developed close working relationships with two of my
                    friends, Joachim Bitterlich, the National Security Advisor, and Admiral Ulrich
                    Weisser, the head of the FRG Defense Ministry's policy planning. During the
                    summer Chancellor Kohl had come to attend the World Cup soccer opening game in
                    Chicago. I attended with Holbrooke, who used the occasion to discuss with
                    Weisser a line in the Defense Minister's upcoming speech at the New Traditions
                    conference endorsing NATO enlargement. Holbrooke then worked on adding a line in
                    the Vice President's speech as well.</p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>Mr. Gore mentioned NATO enlargement in his remarks. When Secretary Perry spoke to
                    the New Traditions meeting, we had been able to put in a little line in it about
                    talks on NATO enlargement from the January 1994 NATO summit. In Perry's speech
                    he mentioned that it was important to begin NATO enlargement negotiations. As
                    planned, Volker Ruhe, the German Defense Minister said, “That means now.” to
                    which Perry said “No.” The lines were drawn. From January to September we worked
                    very hard to break this knot. Nevertheless, NATO enlargement as an issue was on
                    the U.S.-German table and it was clear that we wanted to have this debate. We
                    needed understanding of what NATO enlargement meant and who was playing and how
                    important the issue would be for us.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We've been talking about this peculiar thing of DCM but
                        you were also in Washington dealing with NATO enlargement. I would like you
                        to address the next time around how NATO enlargement was being discussed
                        within both the State Department, the NSC, and particularly the Pentagon and
                        also Congress. The other question I'd like to ask would be during this time,
                        which would be from when to when? You took over that job...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: I was Office Director from 1992-1994. Although I was assigned as DCM
                    Germany in October 1993, I actually physically moved to Bonn in June, 1994.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, in this '92-'94 period, how were the events in
                        Yugoslavia seen, particularly through your position? Also, what you were
                        getting from Germany? Not just because of the NATO thing but how we were
                        reacting and the debates that you were observing about what to do there.
                        Also, the reaction, you referred to is somewhat, the Clinton Administration,
                        one had a feeling that early on Clinton was not, his campaign had been
                        focused on economy and he had been a Governor of Arkansas, so this was not
                        an Administration that came in with a high level approach to foreign
                        affairs. Warren Christopher was not a conceptualizer, at least he was more
                        or less the lawyer who dealt with the problem on his plate. So I'd like to
                        get your feelings, but we'll pick these things when we pick it up next
                        time.</hi>

                <p>Today is June 11, 1998. J.D., we're talking about NATO enlargement, could you
                    give a perspective as you saw it, how State was looking at NATO enlargement, the
                    Pentagon, Congress and the NSC, and note that we are talking about '92-'94,
                    which means that we are straddling Administrations, I mean we're between two.
                    Did these things change during this late Bush early Clinton period?</p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Actually, if you start a little bit earlier, just before I came back
                    to State from Rockwell International to head the German desk, the key decision
                    dealing with the Germans came with the issue of recognition for Croatia and
                    Slovenia. U.S. policy at the end of the Bush Administration was to treat
                    Yugoslavia as unified country, not encourage its break-up, but encourage the
                    resolution of its internal conflict. At the same time when the fighting broke
                    out, the European debate, especially among Germans, was focused on stopping the
                    fighting. German Foreign Minister Genscher came up with the idea that if you
                    recognized Croatia and Slovenia; that is, made this problem an international
                    problem, then the international community would then act in the way to stop the
                    fighting. In conceptual terms Genscher's idea may have been correct, and you
                    could argue that our position wasn't leading to a resolution of the conflict
                    either, however, by recognizing Croatia and Slovenia, the Europeans only
                    successfully internationalized the problem. They only got half of the issue
                    correct by making the German position the EU one. The first half of the issue
                    was to make it international issue, the second half was to intervene
                    internationally to stop the fighting and they were not prepared to intervene. If
                    the EU was not prepared to intervene and the UN was not able, the result was
                    quite different than the hoped for result from the Genscher policy initiative.
                    The fighting did not stop; it got worse. The fighting and ethnic cleansing
                    spilled across the U.S. debate in 1992-93, when we were looking at that issue as
                    Yugoslavia broke up.</p>
                <p>And in terms of NATO, the debate from my vantagepoint was whether our job in
                    Europe was finished and therefore perhaps we could go home. We asked whether we
                    really even needed NATO? That was the debate. The sub-text was whether we could
                    downsize dramatically our Forces in Europe. We had taken our Forces to the Gulf
                    War and rather then bringing them back into Germany after the Gulf War, we
                    re-deployed them to the U.S. The Pentagon set about reconfiguring the U.S.
                    military presence in Europe and considered what force structure was necessary.
                    They debated how to build two divisions, or two divisions (minus), and which
                    bases were necessary and which could be closed. I became the U.S. Embassy
                    negotiator on “residual value” of closed U.S. bases in Germany, a debate over
                    money for military construction or for construction of a new U.S. Embassy in
                    Berlin.</p>
                <p>The whole concept of downsizing and eliminating our presence became also a
                    political debate. In September of 1995 this process of U.S. abandonment of
                    Europe was referred to in a speech at a symposium I attended at the Bundestag in
                    the Wasserwerk. A French member of National Assembly spoke against relying on
                    the U.S. by saying, “Look the Americans after the Gulf War re-deployed to the
                    U.S., downsized their forces, they will continue to do that and they will leave
                    Europe and go away.” My Wasserwerk speech called for new defense industry
                    partnerships as well as competitive projects to solidify our transatlantic
                    cooperation. The tenor of the debate was the end of NATO and war in Europe for
                    the Europeans to solve; that is, Bosnia was a European problem. Unfortunately
                    the European made the problem worse, while we were downsizing and leaving. At
                    the end of the bush Administration there was very little debate about NATO
                    enlargement, because the issue was really about NATO's role and the continued
                    presence of the Americans in Europe.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think that the issue could be, particularly from
                        the Department of State side, would be NATO made sense because it keeps all
                        the military forces in the area under one tent, you know, we were there to
                        keep France and Germany from going at each other again. And that in a way it
                        doesn't look likely but it's still very much a possibility with a change in
                        political leadership. So, it's a good idea to have it. From the Pentagon
                        side, I would think it's something for you military forces to do, it gives
                        employment to your troops. Congress would look the other way and the NSC
                        would be trying to balance it up. Could you talk about this particular
                        '92-94 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: In the early part of that debate indeed the question for the military
                    was whether returning forces t the U.S. would mean demobilization. In fact, U.S.
                    Forces were being downsized radically and DoD had to decide to keep their forces
                    in the U.S. or in Europe. As DoD downsized in the US, the political pressure in
                    Congress to downsize in Europe instead of the U.S. was much stronger. From where
                    I was sitting the pressure was to maintain some semblance of NATO commitment,
                    but to build the force structure to maintain it at home as well as to keep a
                    minimal structure in NATO. There was also debate in the White House and in the
                    State Department about the Franco-German relationship. We perhaps were convinced
                    by the post war and Cold War experience that the Germans and the French had
                    cooperated for this long period and that it wasn't necessary for us to play a
                    mediator role in Europe any longer. If we didn't need to be there to keep to
                    keep these formerly warring parties apart, they could build their own force
                    structure to deal with the military problem in Bosnia. At the beginning of the
                    process we were encouraged the Europeans to deal with this European problem.
                    However, by the time of Chancellor Kohl's first visit to the new Administration
                    in March 1993, the issue had changed significantly because Europeans were not
                    able to deal with Bosnia. They were unable to bring themselves together; they
                    were unable to bring military force to bear on the problem. Frederick the
                    Great's comment was very applicable. He said, “Diplomacy without weapons is like
                    an orchestra without instruments.” The Europeans were playing at diplomacy, but
                    they didn't have any instruments. They couldn't solve the Bosnia problem without
                    us.</p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>At the beginning of the Clinton's Administration, very early part, Christopher's
                    very first speech was on Bosnia, and how we deal with Bosnia. Then Volker Ruhe
                    gave this March speech on NATO expansion, trying to draw the U.S. into using
                    U.S. military force to help NATO deal with Bosnia. That was the beginning of the
                    debate and preparation for Chancellor Kohl's meeting with President Clinton for
                    the first time in March of 1993. The discussion inside the NSC and the State
                    Department was not about NATO enlargement, it was about Bosnia and how do we
                    bring military forces into Bosnia. The debate ran along the lines of: the only
                    forces we had were NATO forces; did we want to use them? No, we didn't. In the
                    end, we decided on a UN mandate and preferred to have the United Nations be the
                    multilateral forum. The UN could bring in not NATO, because NATO had opposing
                    forces in the former Warsaw Pact; deploying NATO troops to former Warsaw Pact
                    countries was not conceivable. But those former Warsaw Pact countries were the
                    very countries that were affected. They couldn't be brought into NATO we
                    thought, and consequently a UN mandate seemed to be a more reasonable approach
                    to deal with the Bosnia problem. As we then moved through the beginning of that
                    period of March to May, June of '93, there was a debate among ourselves, “what
                    did the Germans mean when they talked about NATO expansion? What did Volker
                    Ruhe, the Defense Minister mean? Why did he do this? What was his purpose?” The
                    Germans refused to pronounce themselves openly on what the policy was, in part
                    because they had never used their military since the Wehrmacht in the Second
                    World War. They were very tentative and didn't want to unleash an argument among
                    the Europeans that would bring them back into conflict.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was also against their constitution at that point,
                        wasn't istill?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: The Constitution was the issue: it said they could only use their
                    force in alliance. The government wanted to make its forces available outside of
                    the borders of NATO. A friend, General Bruce Scott, wrote a paper at the
                    National Defense University at the time with the theme “NATO, Out of Area or Out
                    of Business.” That theme captured the debate. The Germans had not tested the
                    constitutionality of out-of-area deployments, which a Balkans force would
                    entail. They wanted to have someone else take the leadership on the NATO issue.
                    The Germans strongest argument for deployment was in NATO; second was UN
                    deployment. Neither had been tested in the court or in public opinion. Ruhe
                    wanted us to take the initiative and present the NATO enlargement and no one in
                    the U.S. was rising to the challenge. The next political event happened not from
                    the White House or the State Department, the NSC on NATO enlargement, but rather
                    from the Congress. That was in June 1993 when Senator Lugar, republican from
                    Indiana, gave a speech in which he endorsed the idea of NATO enlargement. To
                    bring these countries into NATO as a way of encouraging political development in
                    their countries and bringing their military forces under the principals of NATO,
                    such as civilian control of the military, were strong arguments. That was in
                    June of 1993. Then we had the government of Germany and the American opposition
                    on the similar track. But in the U.S. the debate, NATO “expansion” was opposed
                    by senior figures like Paul Nitze and Senator Nunn and other very long term NATO
                    proponents, saying “To change NATO would be to destroy it. It served its purpose
                    well as it was. So why change it?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From your point of view were they saying “it served its
                        purpose and it serves its purpose well,” or were they saying “and it's sort
                        of outrun its time and let's think about it.” Was it implied that they were
                        thinking about letting it run its course and eventually move out of NATO you
                        think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: No. Congressional support for NATO was strong, but the circumstances
                    for NATO action had changed. The opponents argued that to change it, was to
                    destroy it and argued for NATO as it was. It was a very reasonable, defensive
                    position when NATO seemed to be under attack for political reasons. In my own
                    view, the problem was that in 1989 when the Berlin Wall came down and we
                    celebrated with great euphoria the end of the Cold War, we also stopped thinking
                    about what life without divided Germany and Europe meant for our policy. We were
                    stuck, but history went on. New conflicts arose, new or old conflicts came back
                    to us, as in the Balkans, the Romanian/Hungarian problems over ethnic conflicts,
                    borders with Poland and Germany, the question of Kaliningrad (Konigsberg) being
                    a part of the Russian Federation. Most such changes, as in the borders, normally
                    led to war in Europe. The peaceful end to the Cold War and its affects on
                    alliances were not factored into our thinking in any strategic way in the early
                    days of 1993.</p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>The thinking evolved throughout the summer of 1993 as the debate moved to the
                    U.S. policy circles, especially about the implications of sending forces to help
                    deal with the Bosnian war. In August of 1993, Steve Oxman, the Assistant
                    Secretary of the European Affairs at the State Department gave a speech at the
                    Atlantic Council. His speechwriter assistant, Bob Litt, and I talked about the
                    Lugar speech and we talked about putting the questions that Lugar and Volker
                    Ruhe had raised into his speech in an academic setting to discuss this issue.
                    That was done, but immediately thereafter attention turned to a NAC meeting,
                    North Atlantic Council, in Brussels where we were negotiating what we would
                    contribute and what we would not contribute in terms of Bosnia. And that was the
                    debate that was happening in the State Department, in the Pentagon and in the
                    NSC over questions such as why and where do we send forces and who should
                    command these forces? It was clear that DOD did not want U.S. Forces commanded
                    by the UN; they should be commanded by the U.S. We also discussed how a
                    multilateral and multinational force could be commanded by NATO. That was the
                    discussion and we tried very hard, and ended up with IFOR, UN forces, without
                    American combat troops.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling that, I mean the Clinton
                        administration came in with the phrase “Domestic economy is the most
                        important thing” and President Clinton had not had any real foreign affairs
                        experience. You did not have a Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, who
                        had a world outlook. I mean it was basically, maybe I'm not being fair, but
                        seemed to me, a man who was sort of the house lawyer for international
                        affairs. He would deal with the problems, whatever the problems were on
                        hand, he would deal with the, but he wasn't looking for anything. Did you
                        have the feeling that you didn't have an administration that was willing to
                        focus on this at the beginning?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: I had no doubt that the focus of the Clinton Administration was
                    Bosnia. The Administration's effort as well as a very sincere effort by Warren
                    Christopher, was to try to understand that Europe after the Cold War was
                    different. We used NATO procedures and felt close to the Europeans through our
                    values. Operationally the U.S. would lead and NATO would take whatever policy
                    prescriptions we laid on the table and go forth. In May of 1993, Warren
                    Christopher went to NATO with stops at several European NATO capitals with a
                    proposal to deal with Bosnia, but nevertheless to have NATO deal with Bosnia. It
                    was called “Lift and Strike.” This “Lift and Strike” policy was to lift the arms
                    embargo and strike at warring parties that would violate a ceasefire.
                    Christopher was unlike those Secretaries of State who preceded him in the Cold
                    War, whose message to NATO was: “This is what the United States has in mind;
                    we'd like you to agree.” During the Cold War the NATO representatives would
                    argue around the table and then they would agree to the U.S. proposal.
                    Christopher was different. He sought to build a consensus on this “Lift and
                    Strike” policy before actually proposing it.</p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>When he arrived in Brussels for the NATO meeting in May of 1993, he thought that
                    he would have some consensus. However, the opposite, quite shockingly occurred.
                    Despite his forward leaning, new look at the new Europe, by a new post Cold War
                    America by the new administration, the Europeans didn't like this lift and
                    strike idea because it actually meant using military force against the Serbs and
                    other warring parties. So they ganged up on Warren Christopher and attacked him
                    during the meeting and rejected the American policy. Christopher was angry and
                    the rejection became a key event in determining Christopher's orientation
                    towards the Europeans. The Europeans' effort to bring themselves together was
                    only successful in blocking something that the U.S. wanted. It set a tone for
                    our relationship and not a very good tone at all for the relationship that was
                    to follow. Bosnia became the defining issue of our relationship.</p>
                <p>So we came up with another idea of the Contact Group, bringing the key countries
                    together to talk in the smaller group, to try and create a consensus and to work
                    the policy through. But Christopher did indeed have a strategic vision at the
                    beginning of the administration, on this issue, on Bosnia and security in
                    Europe, and was torpedoed. And had to go back to the drawing board then and come
                    up with something else. Christopher did not return to Germany again until
                    September 1996.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At this point obviously, you are a European expert at the
                        State Department and you are surrounded by the other European experts. The
                        Europeanists and the Department of State, were they expecting this
                        torpedoing of the plan, what did you think before he went in and when he
                        came out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Going into the visit, some of us suggested that we have a new
                    approach, and this consultative approach was adopted. Other Europeanists were
                    saying, “No we have to stick with American leadership, and we have to be the
                    hegemon and we have to tell them still.” There was a serious conflict in
                    Department. Christopher agreed with the approach that we could create a
                    consensus through consultations because we had common interests in the post Cold
                    War. He believed that we also could achieve consensus on the Balkans. Well,
                    clearly that thinking was premature, not only among some of Americans, but
                    certainly among the Europeans. I think it reflects the real underlying political
                    dynamics that were and still in play now in 1998. What is the new Europe and how
                    do they conduct politics? The old Department of State Europeanists, including
                    me, have years of experience with the old thinking, which reaches only a few
                    years into the new dynamic. It is very uncertain how to consult, encourage and
                    create consensus with the Europeans. As the result, while there is no serious
                    crises to bring us together, there is no serious crisis to split us.
                    Consequently, we fight little battles. This was a little one, which demonstrated
                    that the U.S. is of two minds, and the Europeans were of at least 20 or 30 minds
                    over what should be done.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this '92-'93 period, what were the developments on
                        thground, as far as European commitment and UN commitment in Bosnia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: The issue played out in a couple of ways. One, it played out drawing
                    on the historical connections among the British, French and Russians with the
                    Serbs as well as between the Germans with the Croatians. These historical
                    connections played a very important role in creating tensions between the UN
                    sending forces and the Bosnian receiving states. UN hat or no UN hat, there was
                    no consensus on the use of force or whether use of force is even legitimate.
                    Only after the bombing that ended the fighting and led to the Dayton Accords was
                    a certain understanding that use of force had a role. The Europeans in Bosnia,
                    under the UN/IFOR mandate, debating incessantly over the use of force. In the
                    German case, the Germans were as you mentioned earlier were having this problem
                    with their constitution and allowable military deployments. They had a
                    constitution that in practice for 45 years had led them to not use their
                    military as a tool of diplomacy. When they had an opportunity to deploy military
                    forces in the Gulf War, they declined. Germany, knowing the agony and the
                    implications of not participating militarily in the Bosnian conflict, although
                    it was outside its own borders, was determined to find the proper role. When it
                    came to Bosnia and especially after the Genscher proposal for recognition of
                    Croatia and Slovenia had failed to end the violence, they were looking for some
                    other way to deal with the issue. The Germans were confronted with incremental
                    steps leading to increasing military action. They had overcome the first, which
                    was their participation in sanction in the Adriatic? They had sought and won a
                    court ruling that German military could participate. This set the pattern for a
                    process of political and legal steps for greater Bundeswehr participation in
                    out-of-area operations. Next was the decision on Luftwaffe crews flying AWACS
                    missions over Hungary, which is outside of the NATO area. That mission was also
                    acceptable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: AWACS being?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: The airborne warning and air control system, a radar system, which we
                    were using to oversee the battlefield in the Balkans and to determine who was
                    violating the no-fly areas. It was not a combat role. The Germans took
                    themselves again to court, to gain court acceptance of the political decision.
                    Then it came to the question of Bundeswehr participation in the IFOR. This
                    debate took them up through the summer of 1994.</p>
                <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                <p>In the fall of 1993 and the spring of 1994 the debate was over Partnership for
                    Peace. That was a sideline in the first instance on how to get partners in a
                    multinational peacekeeping force in Bosnia. The State Department was in favor of
                    using these countries but not altering the structure of NATO. The Pentagon
                    preferred not to have them in NATO at all, and not to have them engaged at all,
                    but to have them as a separate organization. So, Partnership for Peace became a
                    partnership, actually from August 1993 when we decided to participate until we
                    came to NATO debate in the summer of 1994, the issue was how do you use the East
                    Central European countries. They were directly effected; we didn't want them to
                    become NATO members.</p>
                <p>You may recall that we discussed the bilateral effort to deal with this issue in
                    the fall of 1993, when Frank Wisner, the Under Secretary of Defense for policy
                    met with his counterpart, State Secretary J�rg Sch�nbohm. They met in Berlin and
                    I was a part of the delegation. Wisner was there to prepare for the Defense
                    Minister's meeting in Travemunde. The issue Partnership for Peacekeeping; we
                    were trying to develop a peacekeeping force that wasn't a part of NATO, that was
                    a part of the UN, where you could draw peacekeeping forces from other countries
                    and send them and deploy them and so on. Frank Wisner and J�rg Sch�nbohm sat
                    down and came up with a proposal. As State Department official I of course had
                    to oppose any structural change and particularly one that would change the
                    nature of NATO. But in the end they came up with a proposal that they took to
                    the Defense Ministers in Travemunde, where they proposed “Partnership for
                    Peacekeeping.” Partnership for Peacekeeping outside of NATO, maybe in a long
                    term step towards NATO, but a separate thing in itself. Of course, the minute
                    they made this proposal, it became entangled in the Bosnia versus NATO debate
                    over structure. An elaborate discussion ensued in the Department of State over
                    work-plans and which countries would be invited to participate. As you can
                    imagine the debate was endless over duties, the terms of reference, rules of
                    engagement and all those normal things that occur in creating a military force.
                    The workplans dominated the debate, not NATO enlargement, for most of the end of
                    1993 and the beginning of 1994. This was also the case for the German-American
                    relationship as well as the NATO debate between the State Department and the
                    Pentagon.</p>
                <p>The other idea that came up at that time was the concept of using of European
                    forces with American resources at NATO on a European-lead operation called the
                    “Combined Joined Task Forces,” CJTF. That force was being batted back and forth,
                    but the Europeans didn't move very far with that because they wanted American
                    combat troops.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where the French at this time playing around with the
                        European brigade, and this concept? It goes back to the '50s or '60s, I
                        guess, European force?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Yes, the idea of European defense force. The Germans and the French
                    had worked together of the Franco-German brigade for a long time, and they had
                    something at least in technical terms that was implemented. The idea was for
                    Germans, indeed to have these brigades, and one of the ideas was to have one
                    Franco-German brigade, one with the Dutch... Eventually, and they do today, to
                    have one with the Poles. Their concept was to work bilaterally as well as
                    multilaterally to develop military to military relationships at the same time
                    they were doing the political-military relationships and the NATO
                    relationships.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was happening '92 to '94 on the ground, I'm little
                        confused with the time, in Bosnia? There was a period of time when there
                        were particularly French and British troops which were taking casualties and
                        everything else, and were absolutely ineffective, the UN. It will take a
                        long time before anybody will ever want to put their troops under the UN
                        again. Was this happening at that time? We are taking about the siege of
                        Sarajevo, which was on TV every day, showing armored vehicles sort of
                        sitting there while atrocities were being committed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: The UN Force, without the rules of engagement necessary to end the
                    fighting, were absolutely ineffective. There was on going ethnic cleansing and
                    genocide. There was an armed conflict. The UN had placed its forces into stand
                    between the warring factions, but didn't give the commanders the right to shoot.
                    They had the “double key” decisiothat the local commander would make the
                    decision that he would defend himself and then he would go up to higher command,
                    at the political level to get approval for that. As a result they could not
                    defend themselves. They stood between the warring parties, getting shot by the
                    both sides, taking some severe casualties, and were not stopping the fighting at
                    all. They were being bypassed, and that was the situation in '92-'93 that IFOR
                    faced.</p>
                <p>Politically in Germany the other debates were about the German Bundeswehr, the
                    largest military in Europe, which was not allowed to be legally deployed
                    out-of-area. Working towards the summer of 1994, on July 12 1994 I believe,
                    President Clinton came to Berlin and during that meeting, the German Supreme
                    Court in Karlsruhe decided the legal cases about German military deployments. It
                    said that Germany indeed could send its forces as a part of the alliance to
                    other area. President Clinton announced this decision, and the Chancellor of
                    Germany said that doesn't mean “Germans to the front.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were both sort of spontaneous?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Yes, we did not know what or when the decisions would come and the
                    reactions were very spontaneous. You could see there that the Germans were
                    struggling with their military role as a key component to their role in Europe.
                    Everyone else was looking at them skeptically to determine where they would fit
                    in Europe and how they the Germans would exercise power in the future, including
                    military power.</p>
                <pb facs="0156" n="Page0156"/>
                <p>In the meantime in Bosnia, the Serbs and the Croats and the Bosnians continued
                    their unrestrained fighting. It wasn't until we decided that we have to do more
                    and moved to deploy US troops in SFOR that the situation began to change. We
                    refused to give command to the UN, we wanted the NATO command. We wanted to
                    resolve the Bosnia conflict with the right to use force. The change coincided
                    with the departure of Ambassador Holbrooke from Germany in 1994 and his
                    appointment as Assistant Secretary of European Affairs. He was joined by three
                    key players at the State Department Bob Frasure, at Pentagon Joe Cruz, and at
                    the White House Nelson Drew or Sandy Vershbow. Coordination improved immediately
                    among the three agencies on this issue. The meeting of the minds came with
                    Holbrooke on the ground constantly dealing with the individual players and the
                    Pentagon and the NSC and the State Department. He would focus on the issues.
                    When the Croatians made invaded, the US decided not to oppose that invasion.
                    While it was not a “green” light, it was certainly a “yellow” light for the
                    Croatians. Holbrooke also knew at that time that force was necessary and decided
                    that we had to stop fighting by use of military force. Bombing the Serbs
                    followed. It was effective, short, but effective. After the fighting stopped,
                    the negotiations began that ended up in the Dayton process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there, during this talking about NATO and Europe doing
                        things on its own, there seemed to be one development that happened really
                        from the beginning of NATO and really not much attention was paid to it. And
                        that is: for projecting force anywhere beyond sort of practically the Wiser
                        Line in the old days, you couldn't do anything without the U.S. lifting the
                        troops, carrying the troops... I mean, today, none of these forces can go
                        anywhere unless the U.S. is taking them there, which means we are in combat,
                        at least in the air or at least our transport... Is that something that was
                        a factor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Yes, U.S. military transport was absolutely critical to deployments.
                    We agreed to give support services, and in fact not just the transportation
                    services, also communications and intelligence sharing. We could communicate and
                    we had the communications capability for sharing our intelligence. We eventually
                    shared tactical intelligence with former Warsaw Pact countries much to
                    everyone's surprise. We had those two capabilities as well as the fighting
                    forces to complete the mission. In a division of labor, we were providing the
                    communications, intelligence, and the transportation services, and the others
                    are providing the combat troops. Despite the fact that the division of labor was
                    not equal in cost, the fact is that in terms of lives lost direct combat, the
                    U.S. found the cooperation acceptable.</p>
                <p>The Bosnia debate ran parallel all the way through this. At the samtime the NATO
                    enlargement debate began...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was still during the '92-'94 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Yes, Bosnia was ever present during this 1992-94 period. After the
                    President's visit in July 1994, as Holbrooke was leaving Bonn, we had the New
                    Traditions Meeting, which we were talking about earlier, where Secretary Perry
                    and Minister Ruhe debated whether to support new members in NATO. After that
                    September meeting, Holbrooke left and we continued the NATO enlargement debate.
                    We already had in January 1994 decision at NATO, in principle to talk about new
                    members. In that September meeting we had the Vice President and the Chancellor
                    as well as Minister Ruhe and Secretary Perry, saying, “Yes, we should start this
                    process.” By the beginning of 1995, we were talking about first principles for
                    new members. We re-examined the Washington Treaty for NATO requirement and asked
                    the new aspirants: “These are the principles you have to adhere to, for NATO
                    membership, can you meet them?” We began to see a debate, a very positive debate
                    over criteria among those Eastern European countries that had their own ethnic
                    and other conflicts even as they were hopeful to join NATO. Hungary and Romania
                    had ethnic minorities and conflicts that had traditionally been flash points,
                    which we would not accept as imports into NATO. They had to resolve these
                    issues. We began to talk about these specific things that were necessary to join
                    NATO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there thinking..., I'm sure that within the Pentagon,
                        the professional military, they had been looking into what had been
                        happening in Bosnia under UN command, and in the State and all, was this
                        beyond, I mean there was always the political debate that we don't want to
                        commit American troops under UN command. This is a very political thing. But
                        looking at it from professional side, both State and military, taking one
                        look at what happened there and saying “Hell, no.” NATO is not to be used as
                        a peacekeeping instrument with American troops. We had already gone through
                        the Somalia business, or had just finished that. Was this sort of in the
                        thinking?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Certainly we didn't want any UN command structure, particularly after
                    the “dual key” experience. It was not just the fact that UN command of U.S.
                    soldiers did not play well in the U.S.; it just didn't work. We could only be
                    effective if NATO was in command, and we were in charge of NATO. We prevailed to
                    have NATO forces with and American general in charge in Bosnia. He has a
                    subordinate general from Russia, who after his assignment in Bosnia for the
                    American general was actually promoted, which was a good thing for the Russian,
                    but also a sign that it was a good relationship. Symbolically such a U.S.
                    Russian relationship illustrated the changes that were happening. But for us,
                    only an American commander of American forces, in political terms, was
                    acceptable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you noticing any estrangement between either the
                        diplomator professional military of France, Germany and the US during this
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0158" n="Page0158"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: What I found was remarkable, in military to military discussions, the
                    American and German military were very close. They had grown up together; they
                    had commanded troops together in Germany with its large American military
                    presence. What was interesting was the comments by military officers that I
                    knew, both German and American, about the French. In this time they had the best
                    relationship that they had ever seen with the French military. This was under
                    Mitterrand, so it was still politically unacceptable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a socialist.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Yes, and although it was not appropriate for the French to think in
                    terms of cooperation and integration, the French military relationship with the
                    other military was very, very good. I was surprised.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think one of the things, I talked to somebody else who
                        was involved as a political adviser to general Schwarzkopf during the Gulf
                        War, which was only about two years before. When the French sent an
                        expeditionary force and they found they couldn't practically operate because
                        they had been kind of cousins to NATO, but they didn't have the
                        communication, when they went out to bomb they had to send an American plane
                        out to lead them... I mean, they had realized how far away they had drifted
                        from being an effective military force.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: That was reflected in the comments that I heard from U.S. and German
                    military officers. After the Gulf War fiasco, the French military wanted to be a
                    part of the Bosnia team. They wanted to be able to be an effective fighting
                    force. And they knew from that experience in the Gulf War that they would not be
                    outside of NATO. And I think probably this led to Jacques Chirac's initial
                    overtures to NATO after he came into office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there, again in this Washington period of time
                        wheHolbrooke came?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Right, I was Holbrooke's deputy throughout this period. We did
                    several things. We did some of the things we talked earlier about in the
                    business and economic field. We did other things. One of the Holbrooke's initial
                    discoveries was that the U.S. Embassy in Bonn was very big. And he said, “Why
                    are we doing all this? Who are all these people and what are they doing
                    here?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are talking about the Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0159" n="Page0159"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: We're talking about the Embassy. The U.S. Government presence was
                    huge. It was over 2,000 people when he arrived in the fall of '93. We worked
                    very hard to downsize. The GAO reduced their presence; the Federal Aviation
                    Administration, which had 50 or 60 people also reduced their presence. We worked
                    with the Agriculture Department to consolidate their operations in Hamburg and
                    London into the Consulate in Hamburg. And we even tried downsizing in the
                    Embassy itself. At the same time we proposed, in this whole initial effort of
                    the Clinton Administration to make the government smaller, several ideas for
                    closing Embassies and Consulates.</p>
                <p>Well, we also took the opportunity to take the agenda that we had in Germany,
                    which was moving from purely, or overwhelmingly, security focused agenda, to one
                    of business promotion and other issues. Holbrooke determined that we really
                    needed a U.S. Consulate in Dusseldorf. There was one earlier but it had been
                    closed in 1987. We had a small Foreign Commercial Office there, with a couple of
                    people working with a couple of national employees there. Holbrooke wanted to
                    reopen the Consulate and asked the Department for permission. And they said
                    “No.” Holbrooke gave me this assignment to reopen the Consulate. I went through
                    the process. I had a great memo with 15 or 20 clearances making a persuasive
                    argument that our business and economic interests were so great in the area,
                    that the Embassy was moving from Bonn to Berlin, and that we really needed a
                    strong economic presence in the most populous State in Germany. The bureaucracy
                    defeated me and when Holbrooke visited Washington, he came into the office, and
                    just stormed into my office. He was furious that his project was rejected and
                    let me know what he thought of my bureaucratic skills. This incident happened
                    after I was appointed his deputy but had not arrived in Germany. He demanded
                    that I go back to the drawing board, and he was inclined toward a more directed
                    approach. Consequently, he engaged directly in a bureaucratic battle of some
                    proportions with the Under Secretary for Management, Richard Moose, who was not
                    on good personal terms with Mr. Holbrooke. After their knock-down, dragged out
                    fight, Moose decided that if Mr. Holbrooke were to be engaged in this that there
                    would never be a Consulate in Dusseldorf.</p>
                <p>Holbrooke then left it in my hands, with the instructions to make it happen. I
                    took this idea to the Foreign Commercial Service and asked if they were
                    interested in a deal. Mr. Fort, the acting director general of the Foreign
                    Commercial Service, working with the EUR administrative office, negotiated a
                    MOU, Memorandum of Understanding, between two organizations. We had the approval
                    or at least the framework approval of the Under Secretary of Management, to try
                    this negotiation. We agreed to a per-head cost-sharing basis for shared
                    administrative costs and to assigning a Foreign Commercial Service to the
                    principal officer position. The shared costs concept, and paying on head-count
                    basis, became later a model for cost-sharing in the U.S. State Department, away
                    from the shared administrative services agreement based on hopeless
                    landlord/tenant agreements where the Department of State always lost to agencies
                    with stronger appropriations committee arrangement. Nevertheless, Mr. Moose saw
                    this agreement as favoring Holbrooke, despite its advantages for the Foreign
                    Service, and forbid its approval by his administrative officers.</p>
                <pb facs="0160" n="Page0160"/>
                <p>We went back and redrew it up and negotiated again with some minor changes and
                    presented it to him under the authority that he had given us. I negotiated by
                    authority that he himself had given us. Now he faced a fait accomplis, and
                    indeed had to recognize that the Memorandum that we had agreed with the Foreign
                    Commercial Service was appropriate. The next thing to do was to notify Congress
                    that we were going to open a new Consulate. We drafted up the notification
                    letter, which Moose refused to sign. I went into a rather difficult debate
                    between the Assistant Secretary for Congressional Relations, who didn't want nor
                    could overrule the Under Secretary of Management. After posing questions, she
                    then agreed to move the memorandum forward, I adjusted the letters to fit the
                    congressional concerns and moved the memo to the Deputy Secretary. At the end of
                    the process, the Memo that only had four clearances, each an Assistant
                    Secretary, and requesting the Acting Secretary to send letters to notify the
                    Congress that we were opening a Consulate in Dusseldorf. Acting Secretary of
                    State, Mr. Talbot, told Mr. Moose to sign.In many ways I had a sense of
                    achievement, of a Pyrric victory perhaps, but it was a victory. Ron Brown, the
                    Secretary of Commerce came out to Dusseldorf in June 1994, to open the
                    Consulate. Lee Bohm, the former Commercial Officer from my days in the U.S.
                    Embassy in East Berlin, became the first FCS Consul General. As Ambassador
                    Holbrooke and Secretary Brown raised the flag to open the office, I was pleased
                    at this very nice victory.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What it shows is that, in diplomatic business most
                        difficult and most innovative negotiations are not with foreigners, they are
                        not even with other departments, but within your department. I mean, this
                        shows what you have to do to achieve something. Do you feel that a lot of
                        this was personality?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: No, there was a substantial policy debate here about the changing
                    face of diplomacy; could business interests equal security interests. There was
                    certainly a big element or personality. But the decision to open a
                    business-oriented consulate was also against the policy. The policy was to cut,
                    reduce, eliminate posts. And the policy came up against reality. The reality was
                    we had interest in Germany, we had a valid interest, and then you had a
                    conflict. And the conflict was whether we would defend the interests that you
                    have or are you going to follow through the policy of reducing. And somebody had
                    to make that argument and it included two strong personalities. They both agreed
                    that there was a legitimate argument, but refused to deal with it, and only
                    sought to prevent each side from winning. Once they deadlocked, then it came
                    back to me to try to overcome the Holbrooke versus Dick Moose dual, and to
                    achieve what was best for the U.S. - protection of American interests and an
                    expansion of our role in Germany. We were looking at interests not numbers. We
                    took a minimalist approach with numbers to share costs with Commerce, but sought
                    to actually provide the US government with a very valuable tool, that is the
                    Consulate in the most populous area in Germany, in the largest industrial region
                    in Germany.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the charges that has been laid, I've heard it
                        recently and I assume it's been going on for some time, that is: Germany
                        has, since the demise of the Soviet Union, has become more and more taken
                        for granted, that the US in not spending much time, in a way, you feel
                        Germany is beginning to feel the way Canadians feel, we take them for
                        granted, we're not holding their hand, and we are not doing things. Was this
                        a theme tat was if concern during this '92-'94 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Absolutely. We were withdrawing our forces and were focused on Asia,
                    the Middle East, and Russia. All these places were important to us, anywhere but
                    Germany. Germany was not the focus and the Germans thought that they were still
                    important even when we didn't think so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously, when one is thinking about this, Germany is the
                        key to the whole bloody European equation, which is the most important
                        equation for us probably in the long run. Was anybody sort of saying, “Let's
                        think about Germany” or how was this going?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Some of us were looking for a spokesman who could define the Berlin
                    Republic. We found one in Holbrooke. Before he went out to be Ambassador we
                    brought together at Meridian House as many experts on Germany as we could to
                    brief him. We had this great discussion. They were private experts, professors,
                    government officials. We proposed this theme: Is the new Germany, just a larger
                    West Germany (Federal Republic of Germany) just writ larger with the addition of
                    the German Democratic Republic, or is it new? The views were all over the map.
                    Holbrooke loved this debate because it showed that politics were in flux and he
                    could shape U.S. German relations.</p>
                <p>He set out an agenda with us to protect the strategic military relationship, not
                    to let it continue just to downgrade and degrade. Anyone could see the
                    beginnings a greater role for Germans. Holbrooke really did a very masterful job
                    of laying out the debate. We called i“burden-sharing” or
                    “responsibility-sharing.” That's what we were just talking about as we engaged
                    the Germans as they moved through the process of legitimizing and justifying
                    their constitutional role for the military. In Bosnia they moved from talks
                    about participation to deploying troops as part of the Allianz. They used their
                    Tornado aircraft in a combat role at first in 1996, and then deployed troops in
                    full combat role for the first time since the Second World War. They did not
                    deploy many troops, but in terms of politics, it was significant. Of course, a
                    combat deployment to the region needed also a command role.</p>
                <pb facs="0162" n="Page0162"/>
                <p>Minister Ruhe called me to his office to ask that I intervene to help appoint a
                    German general as Chief of Staff to General Crouch. I duly reported the
                    intervention to the Pentagon and naturally General Crouch chose a UK General,
                    who was in line for the appointment. Six months later the Minister called me
                    again and this time I quietly passed the request informally to General Crouch
                    with some personal encouragement that a German to be his second Chief of Staff.
                    After British general rotated General Crouch decided to choose a German, which I
                    considered critical to the development of the political support in Germany for
                    the Bundeswehr. Germans in a command role for Bundeswehr troops in a combat role
                    and deployed outside of Germany under an American general was certainly in U.S.
                    interest. For the first time since World War II Germany and the United States
                    stood together in combat. That was our goal and helped pave the way for NATO
                    enlargement with the German public, although Holbrooke went on to do other
                    things after only nine months as Ambassador.</p>
                <p>In the economic field, realizing that we needed an American business presence in
                    eastern Germany to complement U.S. investment in West Germany such as General
                    Motors and Ford, which that had been in Germany since the 1920s, we needed new
                    U.S. investment in the East. We devised a series of investment promotion
                    seminars for American investment in the eastern part of Germany, the former GDR,
                    and over my time in Bonn, we became a largest foreign investor. Some were large
                    investments like Dow-Chemical's four billion-dollar investment, which made it
                    the fourth major chemical company in Germany. Louis Hughes of General Motors
                    Germany had brought CEO from Detroit while I was DCM in East Germany to build a
                    new assembly plant in the city of Eisenach. This billion-dollar investment drew
                    in suppliers as well such as seat manufacturers. Guardian Glass invested in a
                    $300 million glass factory in Saxony-Anhalt. New technologies such as the AMD
                    computer chip firm built to compete with Intel. This new Pentium technology from
                    Texas brought some three billion dollars to Dresden. However, not all investment
                    were so huge. We had more than 300 and medium size American companies coming and
                    investing. In our business conferences over the five years, one each year in the
                    five new states, we helped create a network of successful American and German
                    businessmen in Germany's new states.</p>
                <pb facs="0163" n="Page0163"/>
                <p>A real delight was to see Chancellor Kohl regularly to keep him apprized of the
                    American interest in the German economy. One of the most delightful events for
                    me was the Annual Meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in Germany in 1997
                    in Dusseldorf. I shared the speakers' platform with Dr. Henry Kissinger,
                    Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Ron Sommer of Deutsche Telekom, and Mark Woessner from
                    Bertelsmann AG. The Chancellor said that the presence of the Americans in
                    business in eastern part of Germany is a demonstration of American commitment to
                    Germany as a whole. At lunch Chancellor Kohl referred to a private conversation
                    we had had on the need for a strong equity culture in Germany. Kohl asked Ron
                    Sommer how well the Telekom stock was selling and Ron replied with a quick
                    summary of the price and recent sales. Kohl then turned to Ignatz Bubis, a
                    wealthy real estate broker and head of the Central Committee of German Jews, and
                    asked whether he would consider selling some of his property to buy Ron Sommer's
                    Telekom stock. I had to smile since Ignatz seemed not to understand why Kohl
                    would want him to sell property. Wealth creation had to come from equity growth
                    and not from unearned income from property holdings, I thought to myself. Kohl
                    was trying to provoke a discussion, but with only 4% of the public holding
                    stocks at the time, it was clearly not a mature discussion yet. To return to
                    your original question, whether the eastern Germans thought that we had
                    forgotten them; yes, absolutely. However, when we explained what Americans were
                    doing, we won their support for German-American relations. Now, in 1998, the
                    U.S. and Germany have weathered this concern that the U.S. no longer has a role
                    in Germany.</p>
                <p>I recall another meeting morning with Ron Sommer from Deutsche Telekom and the
                    former head of the Federal Communications Commission Reed Hunt. Hunt argued that
                    when we were negotiating the international telecoms agreement, it was the
                    Germans and the Americans that decided its terms. When the Americans withdrew
                    from an earlier proposal and walked away from the table, they were criticized by
                    everyone but the Germans. Later the U.S. came back to the table with the revised
                    international telecommunications agreement proposal, and it was the Germans who
                    were with us to move forward to agreement. That kind of sovereign partnership,
                    even if not equal, demonstrated that we were really achieving the goal we set
                    for ourselves. We have achieved a different kind of relationship, based on the
                    respect for sovereignty. At the same time, we still have a lot of thinking to do
                    to solidify this new relationship, but we made great strides in forging a new
                    dimension to the relationship.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: No, I remained in Bonn. I came in June of 1994 to Bonn, for the
                    President's visit and stayed as DCM. I became charg� when Holbrooke left in
                    August, through the 1994 German election, and then Charles Redman, who was

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With this encouragement of business, here in the US we've
                        heard about Germans having become during this period less and less
                        competitive because of the social cost of the social problems and then the
                        high wages and the fact that any German worth his soul gets, I don't know,
                        six weeks of paid vacation, and so forth. They just priced themselves out of
                        the market. I think caution to any American firm trying to do business with
                        them. Did you talk about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Certainly those social factors and fringe benefits for labor that you
                    mention are crucial economic factors in the kinds of investment that would come
                    into the country. High wage costs mean that you can't come in with a
                    labor-intensive investment, it would not work. You have to hire people, you hire
                    them for a very long time. Firing them is prohibitively expensive with a rule of
                    thumb of a month's salary for each year of service for severance. New
                    investments in Germany were like a Motorola investment to build cellular phones
                    with less than five- percent labor content. GM built a new engine factory in
                    Russelsheim also with very little labor content. General Motors also built an
                    assembly plant in Eisenach. GM bought the Wartburg company that had 20,000
                    employees in the GDR times and built a new factory, trained a work force of 1600
                    to produce two of three times the number of much higher quality cars than in
                    thEast Germany. Indeed, if Americans to invest they had to come in with a
                    product in demand that was high quality and low labor cost. If the labor content
                    was low and the product was high quality, Americans could be competitive. That
                    was the strategy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is what we were telling people? People came and you
                        were laying it out on the line about if you want to deal with Germany you
                        have to do this and this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Absolutely. In fact the Embassy offered excellent facilitative
                    assistance to American business negotiations. We tried to help them develop
                    their strategy and to encourage them to see that it could be successful. Hardest
                    to overcome was the initial look as you just said, and the difficulties of doing
                    business would overwhelm new investors, who would just say, “Forget it.”
                    However, if the investor could get past the initial obstacles, there were
                    lucrative incentives for investments in eastern Germany and the Germans began to
                    promote them. There were tax holidays, investment discounts and rebates, all
                    kinds of incentives to invest. As these American companies began negotiations
                    with the Federal German Government, they would often come to us and make sure
                    that they were talking to the right people and that their arguments could be
                    heard by decision makers. The embassy played an important role in coordinating
                    and facilitating discussions with the German government, particularly on
                    investment issues. Overall, we were really focused on trying to get American
                    business to come in and be present and give us the strengthened role be an actor
                    in Germany for the long term.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a real political reason, obviously for the U.S.
                        We wanted East Germany not to be restive, to be part of the whole German
                        sovereignty, not to become a weak link. But at the same time, the Soviet
                        Union fall apart, satellites have gone away, and I would have thought that
                        there would have been competition from Poland and from Russia and from the
                        Czech Republic and Hungary for some of the same investment. Did you find
                        yourself as American diplomats on the business angle sort of competing with
                        our Embassy people in those places?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: No. The East German experience was really quite different. First, the
                    West Germans, if I can still use those two terms, the Federal German government,
                    began to invest a hundred billion dollars a year in eastern Germany. Some 60 to
                    70 billion dollars of that money went to direct payments to individuals;
                    transfers for unemployment compensation, retirement and training programs. The
                    rest of it, 30 billion plus dollars, went into German investments. The results
                    were impressive. Eastern Germany soon had better infrastructure such as
                    fiber-optic cables, new railroads, new freeways and new airports. The
                    infrastructure that would normally have hindered or encouraged lower grade
                    investments, were upgraded very quickly. But more important was the fact that
                    they had a policy of trying to equalize the wages. That policy was devised in
                    order not to have a big migration from East Germany to West Germany, but it
                    meant that East German workers were priced out of the market. If you had a
                    project that you wanted in East Germany that would have a higher labor content
                    with lower labor cost than West Germany, at the beginning it was 70% and it has
                    moved steadily up to 100%. And of course, correspondingly, unemployment has gone
                    up in the eastern part of the country as wage equalization happened. The U.S.
                    was not really have much competition for the West Germans.</p>
                <p>We did have competition in French investment. The French had some large
                    investments such as Minol, which they bought with it took over a great number of
                    gas stations. This competition made it harder for Esso, BP, British Petroleum,
                    and some others to compete for market share in that sector, but for the most
                    part we didn't have serious competition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you were dealing with this did you find that you were
                        up against, American firms by inference your work, up against all habits.
                        What I'm thinking of is the socialist workers. We know the old saying, “We
                        don't pay you well. That's all right, we don't work well.” This is the sort
                        of the Soviet system, and also holdovers from the old socialist bureaucracy,
                        which essentially was designed to say “No.”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0166" n="Page0166"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: That mentality - the socialist worker problem: “We pretend to work
                    and they pretend to pay us” - is still a problem. Galleries Lafayette, the
                    French retailer, built a store in East Berlin and was forced, after a very short
                    period of time, to fire all of their East German workers and hire French
                    workers, because they didn't have the same customer friendly attitudes needed in
                    capitalist society. That happened. But, it happened along a generational divide.
                    If you were over 50, your professional career had ended at unification. If you
                    were a woman and the market changed from 98% of women in the workforce in the
                    GDR to something closer to what the West Germans had, around 55, or 60%, the
                    market for working women dried up. Unemployment was endemic.For the 30 to
                    40-year-olds, employment was a mixed picture. Among the workers, some had
                    excellent work attitudes, some were able to integrate, and some were able to
                    retrain. Those twenty-year-olds and under were really a different generation,
                    which was socialized differently. They were being challenged differently; they
                    have ambition and drive needed to succeed. There are really three generations:
                    the lost generation of over 50s, the questionable generation and the new
                    generation. That process will take probably until those 20-year-olds are 50, two
                    more generations, before the new socialization process has a full affect on the
                    economy and the society. But things do change in Germany.</p>
                <p>Attitudes are the hardest to change and not just work ethics. One of the saddest
                    reminders of the Second World War was in Dresden. When I was posted in East
                    Germany it was the most vivid scene of remaining destruction and one of the most
                    vivid political discussions I repeatedly had was over the bombing of
                    Dresden.</p>

                <p>BINDENAGEL: The date was February 13, 1944. In the firebombing of Dresden, 30,000
                    or 40,000 civilians were killed; it was a terrible event. In the center of the
                    city was the Frauenkirche, the Church of our Lady, which was bombed, burnt and a
                    day or so after the bombing collapsed. The church simply imploded on that site
                    and the rubble was left by the GDR, accompanied with a propagandist plaque
                    decrying the “Anglo-American bombing of Dresden caused this destruction.” This
                    anti-American propaganda repeatedly spoiled every discussion about Dresden. At
                    the end of my assignment in the GDR in September 1990, we established a
                    Consulate General in Leipzig, with Consul General Todd Becker, an excellent
                    Germanist, who shared my concern about the constant drum beat of
                    Anti-AmericanisAnglo-American bombing destroyed all that was good. Todd and I
                    talked about to do to help change that East German attitude about the role of
                    the United States in the war and about Nazi terror that led to the senseless
                    bombing. One of the things that Todd and I agreed before I left, was
                    reconciliation with the East Germans over the bombing and the GDR propaganda.
                    One of the first things that he did was to arrange a benefit concert by the U.S.
                    Air Force Band in Dresden, for the benefit of reconstruction of the
                    Frauenkirche. The decision to rebuild the church had not been taken at that time
                    and the benefit concert was a very nice gesture. In ensuing years construction
                    began on the church and should be completed in 2006. The fund raising campaign
                    in the mid-1990s was impressive. They sold commemorative watches; I have several
                    and in fact all of my kids have one. In 1994, under Ambassador Holbrooke, a
                    close friend Dan Hamilton who was in Holbrooke's staff, created a fiftieth
                    anniversary commemoration event. Dan met with Mr. Blobel in New York, who had
                    come originally from Dresden and became a wealthy medical researcher in New
                    York. He also met others in Cleveland and together they created a “Friends of
                    Dresden” organization, contributed money, and raised additional funds to make a
                    contribution for the reconstruction of the Frauenkirche. On the 50th anniversary
                    of the bombing we met in Dresden. I was there for this occasion with Mr.
                    Holbrooke, and Minister President Kurt Biedenkopf, who was CDU member actually
                    from Westphalia and had studied at Davidson College in the U.S. Holbrooke and
                    Blobel presented Biedenkopf a 100,000-dollar contribution for the reconstruction
                    of the church. We even shamed the British into participating separately, and
                    they chose to symbolically reconstruct the cross as their contribution. It was
                    after all the British that bombed the city on February 13, 1945, not the U.S. We
                    bombed it before and after, but not on that day; but that's a technical
                    point.</p>
                <p>Dealing with Anti-American attitudes, which were very strong among the 40- and
                    50- year olds and older in the GDR was very important goal for us. We also were
                    honest about our own behavior and confronted our role in the bombing and history
                    of World War II. We tried to also seek reconciliation by participating in the
                    reconstruction.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about during this three year period in particular,
                        the problem of the right wing, but also, right wing almost isn't the right
                        word for, the skinheads. I mean the unemployed, could you explain, what was
                        seen as the movement and how it developed in East Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0168" n="Page0168"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: It is good that you differentiate between East and West Germany,
                    because right-wing extremisms are really two phenomena. In West Germany it
                    really was a neo-Nazi movement, and it was a movement that had come with a long
                    history, sense of disillusion with what had happened in post war period. In the
                    East the phenomenon was somewhat different, and that is discussion of the
                    fascist Hitler period was forbidden. Therefore it was new, and it was something
                    to protest. Whatever your ideological point of view, you could protest. And you
                    could shave your head, and you could do something. You had a group of alienated,
                    unemployed, particularly youth that had nowhere to go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Particularly male, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Particularly male, too, who obviously wouldn't turn to the
                    communists; they hated them, they had delivered the right wing extremists into
                    this new world. They didn't like the West Germans either and they wanted to
                    protest. There was no better protest than to be Hitler-oriented. The extremists
                    were not necessarily very thoughtful or politically motivated, but they were
                    socially alienated, and found sport in beating up on minorities. The problem was
                    that there weren't any minorities in the East. The only minorities that were in
                    East Germany were the guest workers from Vietnam and Cuba. The Cubans were all
                    sent back and Vietnamese stayed. Consequently, there were a few Vietnamese, but
                    they were less than one percent of the population, there just weren't any number
                    of foreigners in the East.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There weren't any Turkish gastarbeiters? They didn't move
                        ithere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: No, the Turkish immigrants were in the West. There were no Jews in
                    the East, either. There were a 150 Jews in East Berlin. The extremists did not
                    need real people to have their protest movement. Certainly if you looked out of
                    place, you could be attacked. The potential violence was volatile. In fact an
                    American was attacked in Suhl. He was a bobsledder and his team was practicing
                    in the Th�ringian Forest. The team went to a bar and were drinking a beer after
                    working all day when some thugs, these skinheads came in, and ruffed up this
                    American. When a black and a Jewish American intervened they were beaten by the
                    skinheads. The U.S. media covered the incident in detail. NBC news coverage of
                    this incident, and indeed it was a horrible incident, was full of commentary
                    about right wing extremism; it was certainly a disturbing political incident.
                    Its cause was attributed to frustration and alienation that had led to lashing
                    out at foreigners. However, it was very hard to find any foreigners, so you had
                    to find a visitor to fit the stereotype.</p>
                <pb facs="0169" n="Page0169"/>
                <p>The serious neo-Nazi movement, where people were killed, occurred for the most
                    part in West Germany, in M�ln, Solingen, and L�beck. Those incidents were very
                    serious, in the sense that they were attacks on Turks and on the synagogue in
                    L�beck. Those extremists were politically motivated and very serious. If you
                    carry that extremism to today, the most recent election in Saxony-Anhalt, a few
                    months ago in 1998, the Bavarian right wing leader and very rich publicist, Mr.
                    Frey, spent much money in Saxony-Anhalt campaign. Saxony-Anhalt is a very small
                    state with a couple of million population, but with a small, active group of 30
                    or so people who identified themselves as German People's Union, DVU, Deutsche
                    Volksunion. The DVU was elected to the Parliament and it seems they have more
                    seats than they have people. I think they had about fifteen people in the party
                    and they won more seats in the Parliament. You can see the potential for
                    protest, which has grown out of this social discontent. It is a very serious
                    problem, but it's a hard problem to solve.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about American influence? I mean people of my
                        generation and even somewhat younger are used to the Amerika H�user all over
                        the place, and American studies were popular. Here is a new and a very
                        influential generation coming up. Do you feel we were doing enough for
                        them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: The next generation was not on our screen. In fact, we had 50 America
                    Houses in your time. When I left we had four and with only one in the eastern
                    part of the country and one in Berlin. The whole nature of what we were doing
                    changed from the cultural center of the 1950' Germany, which introduced Germans
                    to many of the international views that they came to endorse to the America
                    H�user today where we have a very different cross-cultural exchange of
                    German-American ideas. We have not been able to sustain the kinds of connections
                    that America-Houses had produced in the 1950s and 1960s. On the other hand, with
                    an open media, personal visits and academic exchanges, we had a rich connection
                    to our friends, but not systematically enough for a country that is as important
                    as Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is one of those sort of neglects, would you say? I
                        mean, taking Germany for granted, cutting there in order to boost up our
                        presence in Belarus or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0170" n="Page0170"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: That's in fact exactly what we did. When we opened 25 new Embassies
                    at the end of the Cold War, as the Soviet Union broke up, we took all the
                    positions from posts in the European Bureau to reorganize and redirect our
                    energies to Central Asia and the Newly Independent States of the former Soviet
                    Union. Most of the positions came form Germany. That was not all bad, but we
                    needed to have strategy how to prioritize what was important in transatlantic
                    affairs and to continue exchanges, policy debates and cooperation with the
                    younger generation. These new/old priorities were absolutely crucial. Embassy
                    German had as many as 100 international visitors grantees each year, young
                    leaders that can be very useful to us, if we keep up with them. But we had to
                    fight every year for that. We had to fight every year for funding for the
                    Congress-Bundestag exchange program for high school students, which linked
                    Congress with the Bundestag for the students who spent one year in the member's
                    district. When I was charg� that program reached a total of 10,000 students
                    since it began in 1983 when we established that program. To keep America-Houses
                    themselves, to redirect their interests and activities, to reach out to new
                    people, not just taking care of the old stalwarts who grew up with
                    America-House, was a major effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Congress? I mean, one of the bete noires of the
                        foreign service is congressional delegations, but at the same times, these
                        are the way you really can sit down and talk to people in Congress, so to
                        sell the importance of your country. And one thing is if congressional
                        delegations are headed of to London and Paris, sort of the flash-spots, but
                        did you find a fall-off coming to Germany and looking at it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Congressional visits did not “fall-off,” they disappeared. We had, in
                    my first two years only Senator Lugar came. He came again a year and a half
                    later. That was it for visits. Lugar was so embarrassed that he called up
                    Senator Kerry and said, “Would you go to Bonn please? We need a Democrat and we
                    only had two visits by Republicans in this year and a half period, and I was
                    both of them.” There were a lot of other visits to Germany by Congressmen, but
                    they went directly to U.S. Forces, and then on to Bosnia. We tried very hard,
                    after the 1994 election when the Republicans took over the House, to convince
                    them to spend some time in Germany. There was an aversion to travel, partly
                    because of campaigns. There was an aversion to having a passport, it was sort of
                    a badge of honor not to have the passport, which is a very troubling
                    concept.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a sort of a “know nothing” attitude at the
                        verbeginning.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Yes, very much so, although we did have a big group of 25 or 30
                    members from the House, prepared to come in January 1995. We had a wonderful
                    program laid on, the delegation included Ben Gilman, Chairman of the House
                    International Relations Comment and Tom Lantos, accompanied by a large House
                    group, the old ones in particular. Then the House shut down the government.</p>
                <pb facs="0171" n="Page0171"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an American shut down of the Government.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Right. They cut us off: the Congress refused to appropriate money to
                    the government, and the government had to shut down. The Congressional
                    Delegation thought it was probably not appropriate that they come, so they
                    canceled the visit, which was even worse. The Germans didn't understand closing
                    down of government at all, and all of our preparations were for naught. The
                    German hosts were lined up and waiting for the Congress Members. They just
                    dropped the visit and did not return for a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, God! Really shocking, isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: That cancellation was really disappointing. I was furious and angry
                    and upset but there wasn't much you could do except keep working on a new visit.
                    At the end of that year, in the year and a half that I was charg�, we did get
                    visitors. And we worked very hard to draw them. There was another consequence of
                    the government shutdown. We could not pay our local employees. The non-payment
                    of employees was simply not acceptable in Europe. I was called into the Foreign
                    Office to explain why the U.S. would not pay its employees, a visit I found
                    quite embarrassing since we would in the end pay.</p>
                <p>The government shutdown would also affect the interim election in 1996. After the
                    election, I urged the leader of the Congressional Study Group on German, Bob
                    Wise of West Virginia to visit and he came out with a delegation almost
                    immediately. I was concerned that the over emphasis by Congress on security
                    questions and NATO led to visits to American troops to the neglect of other
                    American interests. I talked to Congressman Wise from West Virginia, I said, “Do
                    you have any German to foreign direct investment in your district?” He sad,
                    “Actually we have BASF,” which is a chemical company. I said, “That's wonderful.
                    I hope they are doing well, but they are your constituent, and wouldn't you like
                    to see their home office? And I would be glad to try to arrange a meeting with
                    the Chairman.” He said, “That is actually a very good idea and I would like to
                    do that.”</p>
                <p>His five-member delegation came to Bonn and met with politicians. I had called
                    the CEO of BASF, Mr. Strube, and he graciously invited them down on a Friday
                    afternoon in Germany, to see the BASF operation and for a discussion followed by
                    dinner. It was absolutely the right thing to do. Americans and Germans had
                    interest in the same environmental, chemical, and investment issues. BASF had a
                    600 million-dollar investment in West Virginia, which was not a bad thing. The
                    Congressman found that he could sell West Virginia coal for one-forth the price
                    of German coal, even landed in Dusseldorf. I was delighted to see this economic
                    definition of interests, which were always there, even when they were not a part
                    of the security debate.</p>
                <pb facs="0172" n="Page0172"/>
                <p>More visitors came. We had John Chaffee, who examined the Magnetobahn and the
                    high-speed rail as one of the issues that were part of the congressional
                    transportation bill debate. The political debates in Congress and in Germany
                    were on the same issues. Ben Gilman came with a large delegation. Unfortunately
                    at that point they had passed Helms-Burton legislation against investment in
                    Cuba, and the Members of Congress attacked their hosts in Germany on their
                    relations with Cuba. We had legislation on Iran-Libya sanctions, and some of the
                    Germans quietly left the briefing not wishing to offend the guests. I found this
                    important policy debate on economic sanctions useful, especially with
                    Congressmen who has passed the legislation to defend it. We had some other
                    visits as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long was Charles Redman there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Charles Redman came in October, November 1994 and lefin June of 1996,
                    about 18 months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his approach to running the Embassy, towards the
                        Germans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Ambassador Redman had been a spokesman for the Department and had
                    been Ambassador in Sweden. He came to Germany with the view that the Ambassador
                    should be the public person for the U.S. So he gave a lot of speeches and
                    appeared in a lot of activities. I was very lucky, in the sense that he
                    delegated a lot of issues to me in running in the Embassy and to participate in
                    the policy debates as well, which was a great opportunity. I'm very thankful for
                    the support Ambassador Redman gave me in preparation for my time as charg� after
                    he left. But his view was to present America particularly in the press, speaking
                    locally as well as nationally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did it work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: I think it worked well. He was widely recognized and attended many
                    events, and the representational part was very well received. In terms of
                    policy, the policy debate's very hard in Germany, it was very internal German
                    thing and the lines of communication to Washington were very good. So lot of
                    that debate, particularly on the NATO issues were conducted directly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Between top, top, top levels?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0173" n="Page0173"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Right. In fact, however, the U.S. Embassy in Germany played an
                    important diplomatic role in winning German support for NATO enlargement.
                    Ambassador Holbrooke's close ties with Minister R�he continued after he returned
                    and became assistant secretary. However, Holbrooke's main priority was ending
                    the fighting in the Balkans through the Dayton Accords. In Bonn, we continued to
                    report German concerns about NATO enlargement, particularly German sensitivities
                    toward Russia. Whenever National Security Advisor Bitterlich traveled to Moscow,
                    the Russians would press them hard to block NATO enlargement.</p>
                <p>In the summer of 1996, during a stopover flight in Frankfurt, Deputy Secretary
                    Talbot, who was traveling with Vice President Gore, discussed at length with me
                    strategies for winning German support for NATO enlargement. This led to a cable
                    to him outlining specific steps to be taken. I was delighted to see that many of
                    my ideas had stood the test of the bureaucracy and were included in an
                    instruction cable from the Department. My political-military officer, Nancy
                    McEldowney, kept the reports to Washington flowing; I sent e-mails to Talbott as
                    a backchannel to report my own personal views, especially on the German-Russian
                    dialogue.</p>
                <p>In September 1996, Secretary Christopher came to Germany to give a major address
                    on the fiftieth anniversary of his predecessor, James F. Byrnes' 1946 speech of
                    hope, given to set the path for Germany to return to the international community
                    of nations. Christopher met with Chancellor Kohl and on the top of his priority
                    list of issues was NATO enlargement. The Germans seemed nervous about the
                    upcoming NATO summit to welcome new members and were pressing us to delay it.
                    Christopher had language in his speech about scheduling the summit for March,
                    but wanted to check with Kohl to ensure that the Germans would support the
                    proposed date. I called Bitterlich to smooth the way to acceptance; John
                    Kornblum, then assistant secretary, also called to press the point. Bitterlich
                    did not commit Kohl. During the meeting Christopher raised the date and put
                    Bitterlich on the spot. The Chancellor was clearly not pleased with the early
                    date and when pressed stated ambiguously that he could see a properly prepared
                    summit in the spring or summer. On the way to the plane to Stuttgart for the
                    speech Christopher asked me if Kohl's statement was an approval of the date; I
                    told him that he could certainly say spring, but the Chancellor did not agree to
                    March. On the plane Christopher turned to all his aids, noted my comment and
                    asked for theirs. All agreed to the change in the speech. Of course, if the
                    comment drew criticism, they were protected by my comment!The speech was a
                    smashing success. The audience cheered, ignored the NATO enlargement summit date
                    comment and applauded at the Christopher statement regarding working closely
                    with the Russians. Christopher was surprised and pleased.</p>
                <pb facs="0174" n="Page0174"/>
                <p>As an aside, I must tell you about the Christopher speech on climate issues later
                    in the visit at a Stuttgart school. Christopher, whose home may be California
                    now, was really from North Dakota. He was also known as the most dour speaker in
                    the State Department. As he was reading his climate speech I watched closely to
                    see if he would react to the line I added about the temperature experiment the
                    students were conducting. They were reporting on temperatures to help create a
                    database in the U.S. to measure climate change. Sure enough, when Christopher
                    reached the sentence about personally understanding extreme temperatures from
                    his youth when they measured + 40 degrees Celsius to 40 degrees Celsius in his
                    home state of North Dakota, he grinned and chuckled. I considered this a small
                    coup.</p>
                <p>But back to NATO, if I may. As the Washington preparations for the summit
                    intensified, so did the concern about the Germans, the Russians and the French.
                    Talbot seemed to have the Russian role well ironed out. However, the French
                    wanted to include the Romanians in the first group of new members. Italy argued
                    that NATO had to take Slovenia to connect NATO territory. Chancellor did not
                    reveal his position. Embassy Bonn continued reporting, but Washington was
                    increasingly nervous. The date for the summit slipped from spring to summer.
                    Chancellor Kohl set a visit to Washington to meet with President Clinton in
                    June. I accompanied Kohl to Washington. We reported on the German position on
                    new members: Kohl would join the consensus. That position made no one happy,
                    especially Deputy Secretary Talbot. I met with Talbot upon my arrival in
                    Washington before the Oval Office meeting and briefed him on the German position
                    to join the consensus. He pressed me to say that they would join our proposal
                    for only three new members, not five. I could not. The meeting with President
                    Clinton went well until the NATO question was popped. Would the Germans join us
                    in supporting three new NATO memberPoland, the Czech Republic and Hungary? Kohl
                    replied that he would join the consensus. Our team was not happy.</p>
                <p>Back in Bonn we kept very close watch on the NATO debate with our friends
                    Wolfgang Ischinger at the Foreign Office, Joachim Bitterlich in the Chancellery,
                    and Admiral Ulrich Weisser at the Defense Ministry. We seemed to be on track
                    until the Romanian President visited Kohl on the Thursday before the Tuesday
                    Madrid summit. At the end of the visit somewhere around midnight the
                    Chancellor's office released a statement. I went to bed blissfully ignorant of
                    the statement, which we would have normally reported the next day anyway. At
                    three in the morning my phone rang and the Deputy Secretary was calling to ask
                    what this Kohl statement meant. Did it mean that the Germans now supported
                    Romanian membership and would do so at the summit? I had to admit that I had not
                    seen the statement, but would check and report immediately. Talbot pressed for
                    my instant assessment. I told him that I thought nothing had changed, that Kohl
                    would support the consensus, and that the consensus would be three. He said;
                    “You better be right. Let me know in the morning what you learn.”</p>
                <pb facs="0175" n="Page0175"/>
                <p>Of course I could not sleep. I checked the Internet to find the statement and at
                    five o'clock called the press section, which came in early to prepare the
                    Embassy daily press briefing. They went to work on the statement. Overnight the
                    Department Operations Center was doing the same. We reported the text of the
                    statement and then I went looking for Bitterlich and Ischinger. Ischinger I
                    found at the airport meeting French Foreign Minister [Hubert] Vedrine and asked
                    him point blank whether this statement was a change in German policy. He had not
                    seen the statement, but promised to get back to me. I called Bitterlich. His
                    secretary, Inada Johnson, was very pleasant, but told me he was preparing for
                    his morning meeting with the Chancellor and could I call back. No, I insisted to
                    speak with him; it was urgent. When I asked Joachim about the statement, I was
                    greeted with a snide (but not unfriendly) comment about how well I spoke German
                    and just what did I not understand if the statement's comment that Germany
                    supported Romania's “baldige Entritt in der NATO (early entry into NATO).” I, in
                    my best diplomatic tone, said, “Just what does 'baldige Entritt mean?'" He
                    replied: “Just what it says.” Okay, I knew it was to be difficult, and pressed
                    for an answer about next Tuesday's summit meeting. He repeated himself. I then
                    said tell me if I am wrong to report to Washington that the statement does not
                    mean next Tuesday. He did not reject my statement, leaving the responsibility
                    for interpretation to me.</p>
                <p>I thought it best to call Talbot before writing any of this exchange in an
                    official report. I did not have to wait long. At six o'clock Washington time, I
                    was having lunch with an old friend of mine, Fred Kempe, the managing editor of
                    the Wall Street Journal Europe when my cell phone rang. It was Talbot and Sandy
                    Berger. Talbot said: “What did you learn? I told him I had spoken to Bitterlich
                    and stood by my statement that Kohl would stick with the consensus, not adding
                    Romania.” Talbot replied that I had better be correct.</p>
                <p>By now I was personally worried. Later Ischinger would relate to me the events on
                    the morning of the Madrid Summit. President Clinton came into the room and
                    Chancellor Kohl went over to greet him. Kohl told the President, according to
                    Ischinger, that Germany was with the U.S. on new members. When the meeting
                    started Kohl asked to be recognized first and announced that Germany was
                    supporting three new members for NATPoland, Czech Republic and Hungary.</p>
                <p>I had reason to celebrate. When Polish Ambassador Andrzej Byrt decided to party,
                    I was also invited to join in their NATO membership celebration at his residence
                    in Cologne. Ambassador Byrt had a special event in mind. He had a door hung on a
                    frame in the Garden, emblazoned with the NATO crest. Ambassador Byrt, Wolfgang
                    Ischinger, Admiral Weisser and I marched through together. The photo is one of
                    my fondest memories.</p>
                <p>At the end of my tour, Deputy Secretary Talbot offered to nominate me for
                    ambassador to one of the Baltic States. My children, however, were high school
                    age and the country had no high school. I did not want to miss those years,
                    thanked Strobe for the offer, and decided to return to Washington instead.</p>
                <pb facs="0176" n="Page0176"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this period of time, were there any issues that
                        yohaven't covered?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: I'm sure that there are: let me just add one comment. There are some
                    rare fun moments. I'd mentioned annual meeting of the American Chamber of
                    Commerce when as charg� d'affaires I shared the podium with Dr. Henry Kissinger
                    (who as Secretary of State had sworn-in my Foreign Service Class ) and
                    Chancellor, and was praised by both during the meeting; that event was a high
                    point for me personally. The other was the U.S.-based Wall Street Journal
                    reporter who came into my office in the fall of 1996 and posed a question about
                    Secretary Warren Christopher. He said, “Warren Christopher, Secretary of State
                    proposed that the State Department would be the America's desk, and promote and
                    support American business.” And he said, he was there to check up on that
                    proposition. His tone was: “It was a nice pronouncement, but it can't be true.
                    And we are doing an article and we want to really see if embassies are really
                    'America desks.'" I said that given what I'd been saying about business, I was
                    absolutely delighted that somebody would pay attention to what we were doing and
                    added I was absolutely delighted to talk to him and tell him about what we are
                    doing.</p>
                <p>Then he had a secret question, what the Germans call the “Gretchenfrage,” the
                    “key question.” He said, “Let me ask you one question. You know, getting a
                    driver's license in Germany is very difficult and American business people are
                    having a very difficult time, because the German system is you have to give
                    reciprocity, and they have federal licenses, and we have 50 state licenses.
                    Their American licenses run out after a year and the German one costs a lot of
                    money. American businessmen are very upset, what have you done about it?”I
                    didn't want to laugh or smile too much, I said, “Actually, we've done a lot of
                    things about it. In the last year or so, I've written to all of the governors,
                    and I've engaged with visiting governors. We've worked with the American Chamber
                    of Commerce to propose reciprocal recognition. When we started the process there
                    were one or two states, Utah was one of them because they had several of their
                    missionaries in the country and they cared about them, they worked very quickly,
                    and at that point I think we had eight or nine states that extended
                    reciprocity.” He said, “Is that right?” And I said, “Well, let me call the
                    economic officer who's responsible for this and I'll bring down the file, and
                    you can look and see where we stand.” The action officer brought down the file
                    and there were actually 18 or 19 states. Greenberger, the journalist, was
                    absolutely flabbergasted. Then he had a whole series of issues. We talked about
                    investment, what we were doing in promoting for business and so on, and he went
                    away. He said that he would continue to do some research. They were doing
                    interviews everywhere to search out the real story.</p>
                <pb facs="0177" n="Page0177"/>
                <p>Right after the American November election of 1996, I got a phone call from the
                    same Wall Street Journal reporter from the U.S. He called up to ask if he could
                    follow me around for a few days. “I guess.” I said, “Actually, what you might
                    want to do, we're having this investment conference in Potsdam. Why don't you
                    come a day ahead and a day after, and go with me, and I'll show you what we're
                    doing for business.” He showed up, right after the election. The first thing
                    that I had, was a meeting with SPD caucus of the Bundestag, to talk about the
                    election, they wanted to have a political discussion. I said, “Okay, but I have
                    this journalist who is with me.” They said, “Fine, bring him along.” We started
                    to talk about the U.S. election results when the American journalists starts
                    asking me questions. I said, “Wait a minute, whose meeting is this?” We
                    continued the discussion and had a very good session. Afterward I took him to a
                    meeting of Brandenburg representation office in Bonn, where Minster President
                    Stolpe was expected. Although the Minister President was absent, we had some
                    other discussions about U.S. businesses in Brandenburg.</p>
                <p>The next day we were off to Potsdam for more meetings. In Potsdam we met with the
                    U.S. investors, and to the journalists delight, he was having a wonderful time
                    interviewing everybody. The Board meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in
                    Germany followed. I said to the Chairman, Fred Irwin, “You know, there is a
                    journalist and I'm not inviting him in, but if you don't mind...” Sure enough,
                    the journalist goes into the Board meeting, where the Embassy Commercial
                    Counselor is giving a presentation on the embassy's promotion of American
                    business and the Embassy Economic Minister, Janice Bay is presenting on market
                    opening strategies for electricity, energy and gas. I spoke on our common
                    project in this business conference to make the U.S. the largest foreign
                    investor in the new German States. We went on through the conference for the
                    next day and one-half. I gave a few speeches, participated in panel discussions,
                    and watched our journalist friend depart. This was in November, 1996.</p>
                <p>On January 21, 1997 the day after the Second Clinton Administration began, I held
                    our country team meeting in Bonn at the Embassy as usual. Bob Earle, public
                    affairs officer, was sitting in the place next to me. Bob said as I came into
                    the meeting; “Oh, so you like hamburgers?! Did you like what was in the press
                    today?” I was confused and replied: “I don't know what you are talking about. I
                    am not sure whether I like it or not.” “Oh, yeah, you should see the article in
                    the Wall Street Journal.” Bob handed me the article. The headline reads, “Big
                    Mac Diplomacy, U.S. Embassies Walk Softly, Carry Big Stick for American
                    Business.” It notes that a Bonn newspaper picture shows me at a McDonald's
                    Restaurant “chomping” a hamburger in Big Mac Diplomacy. The Wall Street Journal
                    had taken a lead from a picture that I had allowed at a McDonald's 25th
                    anniversary at Bonn, run by two graduates of the Bonn American High School. This
                    hamburger chomping envoy became the lead for a front-page Wall Street Journal
                    article that went on and on, about what we were doing to promote business. It
                    was one of those rare and very pleasant moments to have appeared positively on
                    the front page of a major U.S. newspaper; it was very nice.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything else we should cover on German side? I'd
                        like to just move, if you don't mind, to what you are doing right now,
                        because, it gives some insight. Could you explain what you are doing, and
                        you mentioned something over the phone that sounded like, showing the
                        European world has changed, but it really hasn't changed. Could you talk
                        about what you're doing? This is work in progress, obviously, you're still
                        doing it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Thank you for the opportunity. I have now been working for several
                    months with Under Secretary of State for Economic and Business Affairs, Stuart
                    E. Eizenstat, on a project that he feels very strongly about. He has been
                    working himself on the issue of “Nazi Gold” for two years. That is, gold
                    confiscated by the Nazis and not returned. For Eizenstat the Nazi Gold is a
                    story of how plundered gold helped the Nazi war effort. He asked me if I could
                    join in his effort, because in addition to gold there were other Holocaust era
                    assets that had become the target of discussion. He wanted somebody to convene a
                    conference of 42 countries, several non-governmental organizations, Jewish
                    groups such as the World Jewish Congress, American Jewish Committee, World
                    Jewish Restitution Organization, and others. The conference will address, in a
                    historical fashion, what had happened to art and insurance confiscated by the
                    Nazis. It would review efforts for claimants and Holocaust survivors in
                    particular to claim assets restituted or receive compensation.</p>
                <p>Frankly, I did not look on this as a great opportunity, but rather as a request
                    and a serious challenge. I was skeptical about such an effort because having
                    developed and nurtured the U.S. political relationships with Europe over the
                    last quarter century, particularly in Germany, I knew that those still unhealed
                    wounds of World War II remained most sensitive. In contrast I had been struck by
                    the euphoria surrounding the fall of the Berlin Wall, the end of the Cold War
                    and shared the optimism offered by the move into the 21st century. Europeans for
                    the first time in a century shared with us the great optimism of Americans when
                    looking to the future. I did not like the idea that there was unfinished
                    business of the Second World War, and that I was supposed to help forced the
                    Europeans to come to terms with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Peel the scab off the wound.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Exactly. I struggled with the dilemma of not joining the effort and
                    facing the consequences of deteriorating political relations like we had
                    witnessed in the Swiss-American relationship over dormant bank accounts and Nazi
                    Gold or of joining and failing to stop such a scenario. After several weeks and
                    several opportunities to say “yes,” I agreed to do organize such a conference. I
                    concluded that I might even help resolve the issues by supporting or creating
                    alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. I could only hope for the best and in
                    the process I have re-examined what I've done and realize that someone with my
                    own biography must carry out the duty.</p>
                <pb facs="0179" n="Page0179"/>
                <p>I had come a long way from where I started the process just a couple of months
                    ago. We are going to convene this conference in November 1998 to bring
                    historians and archivists, some government officials, some experts in art,
                    insurance and others together in Washington for a discussion. We begin with the
                    Secretary of State, the Under Secretary for Economics, Eizenstat, delegation
                    heads from these governments. We are going to spend a day talking about the
                    history of the Nazis from 1933-1945 and our efforts at restitution after the war
                    to restore art to its rightful owners, to pay claims against insurance
                    companies, and to finish some of the things on gold. We're going to see what was
                    deferred by the Cold War, what was forgotten. After the Cold War has ended we
                    now are going to go back to finish the unfinished business of World War II. Our
                    aims are to make sure that there is a commitment to open archives so that
                    research can continue, to share the research that has been done and to find some
                    ways of addressing claims, especially those with survivors' interests. In my
                    view more important, we will seek to deal with issues of remembrance, research
                    and education. What do we do for the next generation that will come? For the
                    survivors' money is not everything, money is important, but their own memory of
                    the horrible events conveying that memory in a way that is fair and equitable,
                    and honorable to their suffering will be a challenge. Our emphasis is not for
                    the war generation, not for my generation, not the 50-year olds, but is for
                    those who come after. I learned the other day that the X-generation, my children
                    who are not quite out of high school yet, are called the “Millennials.” We are
                    doing this for the Millennial generation.</p>
                <p>So what are we doing? Let me say that we had a roundtable on Nazi-confiscated art
                    the other day, on Tuesday this week. We brought together representatives of the
                    American Art Museum Directors, Cleveland director Bob Bergman and Earle “Rusty”
                    Powell from the National Gallery among others, we had representatives from art
                    galleries and auction houses -Sotheby's and Christie's.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These are art auction houses, major movers of art around
                        thworld.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0180" n="Page0180"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: We had historians, who had written several books since 1995 and
                    representatives of several Jewish organizations. Several books have been written
                    on the question of Nazi confiscated art and other topics. And as I began my
                    presentation moderating this discussion, I said, that I was struck as I read
                    through the Nicholas' book “The rape of Europa” that I was an Army officer in
                    W�rzburg, where Captain Skelton came and built a tarp over the residence of the
                    Prince Bishops of W�rzburg and saved the “Tiepolo” fresco ceiling from
                    destruction at the end of the war. Continuing, I found myself remembering that
                    German Foreign Minister Kinkel had invited me as a charg� to a luncheon at the
                    guesthouse at Petersburg, overlooking the Rhine river to pay homage and tribute
                    at an award ceremony for Walter Farmer, a U.S. Army officer from World War II,
                    of the Skelton era, for his effort to return art to his rightful owners. Farmer
                    had acted against the wishes of some in the military that wanted to take art
                    from Germany at the end of the war for the “safekeeping” in the U.S. and had
                    written and signed the “Wiesbaden Manifesto,” which set down principles for
                    returning art as the heritage of the country.I recalled that while in the GDR, I
                    had received a letter from the mayor of Quedlinburg about the lost treasures of
                    Quedlinburg that had been taken by an American sergeant and put in a safe
                    deposit box in Texas. The heirs' lawyer, after the sergeant died, and his heirs
                    tried to sell those treasures. However, I had facilitated a contact with the
                    mayor and he lawyer who negotiated these return of Quedlinburg. I noted that Tom
                    Kline, the lawyer, was in the room discussing this issue of Nazi confiscated art
                    with us.</p>
                <p>I turned to my left and there was Constantine Akinsha, who has written a book
                    called “Beautiful Loot.” As I was reading Constantine's book I was struck that
                    while in GDR I came to know the Politburo member Horst Brasch, who was
                    negotiator as Deputy Cultural Minister for the GDR, with the Soviet Union for
                    the return of “The splendor of Dresden,” “The Green Vault”and “The Zwinger” old
                    masters. Suddenly I thought, “maybe I was reluctant to get into this finishing
                    World War II, but maybe there is something that I need to do to finish it.”</p>
                <pb facs="0181" n="Page0181"/>
                <p>We will try to find some guidelines to tell the story and to seek alternative
                    dispute resolution mechanisms to help museums fearful of borrowing art from
                    Europe with the consequences of finding themselves in court for having stolen
                    goods from the Nazis. The Museum of Modern Art in New York had a case of Egon
                    Schiele paintings in a court dispute. There aren't many cases but it's a very
                    painful process. We also will deal with the Russians who captured all the German
                    art and the archives and kept them. The Russians also have art that the Nazis
                    captured or stole from Jewish and other private families during the Nazi era.
                    We're going to try to bring them all together in one place and try to discuss
                    the history and try to not reopen too severely the wounds, but, if the wounds
                    are opened to find a way to heal. For instance, the French have 2,000 works of
                    art that our Army collected at the end of the war, gave back to them, that they
                    then were a part of many more thousands of art works that they gave back, but
                    they have 2,000 that they haven't returned, because they can't find anybody to
                    claim them. The owners probably died in Auschwitz. The French were criticized by
                    Hector Feliciano in his book and they are trying to come to terms with the
                    question whether they did enough. At the same time they have not dealt with
                    their Vichy history, collaborating with the Nazis to steal this art is just a
                    small part. Recently the French tried a Vichy official [Maurice] Papon and
                    convicted him of helping the Nazis deport Jews. Such trials question the
                    preferred French history of glorifying the resistance. I am concerned that this
                    is a very troubled historical debate and we are going to be in the middle of
                    it.</p>
                <p>The Dutch have the similar thing with art. They have 4,000 pieces of art that
                    they have not returned. They can't find the provenance of those pieces of work
                    and so they are extending their commission, under Rudi Ekkarts, that's looking
                    into this issue for three more years, to do more research. At the end of the
                    war, when they were returning things, the Dutch found that for instance the
                    Goudstekker family story. The family had a gallery which was confiscated by the
                    Nazis and the man died, his wife came back after the war, Dutch, and asked for
                    her paintings and her artwork and her property back. The Dutch government after
                    the war said you can have one or the other but not both. A very hard and harsh
                    decision taken not by the Nazis but by the Dutch officials. The Dutch will have
                    to come to terms with that decision.</p>
                <p>The Austrians, having believed and having informally propagated the idea that
                    they were the first victim of Nazi aggression according to a proclamation of the
                    allies in 1943, have also a myth to overcome. I believe the Allies acted in part
                    to keep them from fighting against us, but it has become a major national myth.
                    Changing it, having gone through the Austrian President Waldheim experience,
                    where he was accused of helping the Nazis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a German Army officer, in intelligence work
                        directeagainst Jews in Yugoslavia.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0182" n="Page0182"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: And in Salonika, which was a Jewish city. It will not be easy for the
                    Austrians, either. Anyway, the Austrians have a case similar to the Dutch case
                    at the end of the war. They gave the Rosenberg family the opportunity to export
                    some of their paintings and to leave others, or get nothing. This entire
                    discussion is creating a current debate, a political debate today, based on
                    historical debate.</p>
                <p>What's new for me in the German side is that the Germans have compensated,
                    restituted, indemnified the survivors. They have had a historical debate about
                    their role, sustained over 50 years, they've made the Hitler period the key
                    element of their education system and they are continuing to deal with it. They
                    are not comfortable with it, they do not like it, they do not like to be
                    reminded of it, but they have indeed, if not having come to terms with their
                    history, they have accepted it as a part of their history. The result of that
                    German story is, however, I think, and we will see, is that as the French, Dutch
                    and Austrians will discuss what they did in World War II under new standards of
                    requirements for reconciliation and to compensate that must meet the German
                    standard, and it's very high. And it will be very hard for those countries, 50
                    years later, to catch up. And therein I think lies, seeds for plenty of debate,
                    if not conflict, if not reopening the wounds.</p>
                <p>Our challenge in these few months ahead of us, is to get everybody on a common
                    agenda, and to seek consensus not allowing a divisive debate, but one that
                    should be bringing them together to come to terms with their history. We would
                    not suggest history be put behind them, nor to end it, nor to close it, but to
                    come to terms with history in a positive way. I think the two State Department
                    reports that were done on Nazi gold, where the U.S. made proclamations about
                    what the Europeans did to prolong the war, have probably tested the limits of
                    the American hegemony. There are 16 historical commissions in these countries,
                    all doing their own historical work. We hope to use this conference to bring
                    them together in a way that we can share this historical research, we can share
                    the concepts, we can share the solutions. But there are so many with individual
                    agendas, that we may not be successful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But what's the agenda that's driving us to do this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0183" n="Page0183"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: The primary agenda is the sense of justice. We have some post-war
                    institutions that we have to get rid of. The Tri-Partite Gold Commission needs
                    to be closed. In order to close Tri-Partite Gold Commission you have to give
                    back the gold that was collected by the Nazis. Some of it is tainted gold that
                    was taken from victims, either their wedding rings, or their teeth or whatever.
                    That's awful. And so a Nazi Persecutees' Relief Fund has been created out of
                    London Gold meeting. We have a very strong sense that we need to deal with this
                    history. I think as we go through this we will feel even stronger that we can't
                    get to the 21st century, or the NATO new members summit in April, or the G-7
                    summit in Bonn in the spring, or the U.S. - EU summit in the spring, or the OSCE
                    summit in the spring, or the Germany 50th anniversary of their Constitution in
                    the spring, or the 10th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall in the fall,
                    or the end of the millennium in 1999, without coming to terms with this. My job
                    is to try to get the Secretary and the Under Secretary and the White House and
                    everyone to see that they need to take a position, a role to help this process
                    along. And to get the 42 European and the Israelis and the three Latin American
                    countries that are participating to seize on this task and do something positive
                    with it. And then we can move on. If we don't, we'll be there and we'll find
                    these festering problems will continue to fester. If we can have some sense that
                    we have dealt with them and that we have laid the foundation to build our future
                    through research and education as well as not to be divisive in the compensation
                    and the money issues, then we will have achieved something. The jury is out on
                    the question of our success.</p>

                <p>BINDENAGEL: I'm delighted to have the opportunity to fill in these last episodes.
                    When I was tapped on my return from Germany in 1997/1998, Stuart E. Eizenstat,
                    the Undersecretary of State for Economic and Business Affairs, wanted to host a
                    conference in Washington on Holocaust assets, following on the Nazi Gold
                    conference that had taken place in December 1997 in London. I was brought into
                    the process to bring together 44 countries to discuss issues such as unpaid
                    insurance claims, in effect to ask countries participating in the conference to
                    explain their wartime histories. The conference itself was opened by Madeleine
                    Albright, who had just revealed to the world that she had Jewish grandparents
                    and that she was willing to accept the responsibility of her history and called
                    on these 44 countries to do the same. The outcome of the conference, which
                    lasted from November 30, to December 3, 1998, was really to focus on the
                    resolution of certain issues, including the insurance policies, the restitution
                    of communal properties, and art.</p>
                <pb facs="0184" n="Page0184"/>
                <p>One of the results of the conference was to create a set of principles concerning
                    Nazi- confiscated art, in which the participants agreed to try to resolve the
                    unclear provenance and to restore art objects to victims or their families. The
                    interesting aspect is that several countries, while they had no legal force,
                    implemented these principles. Over the years, dozens of significant artworks
                    have been identified and returned to victims' families or accommodations have
                    been made to resolve questions of ownership, without litigation. One example is
                    from the North Carolina museum of art, which discovered that it had a Cranach
                    painting that had been confiscated by the Nazis. The museum returned the Cranach
                    to the two surviving sisters in Vienna, who were heirs, who were so pleased with
                    the way this was handled that they sold the painting back to the museum for a
                    nominal fee. In an effort to deal with restoration of communal property, Stuart
                    Eizenstat announced some continued action that he was doing in this area,
                    particularly in Eastern Europe. Larry Eagleburger, the former Secretary of
                    State, was tapped to lead the International Commission on the Holocaust Era
                    Insurance Claims, a mechanism that we supported to resolve insurance
                    policies.Lawsuits against German companies were filed in September 1998 for
                    companies' use of industrial forced labor in World War II. German companies'
                    CEO's approached newly elected Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, and asked if the
                    government would support an effort to try to provide compensation for the
                    surviving laborers. The Chancellor was a member of the Social Democratic Party
                    of Germany, which had been persecuted by the Nazis during the National Socialist
                    era. Mr. Schroeder encouraged them to proceed. Some industry leaders, most
                    notably Dr. Manfred Gentz from Daimler Chrysler, Rolf Breuer from Deutsche Bank,
                    and Henning Schulte-Noelle from Allianz Insurance, approached the U.S.
                    government to ask Stuart Eizenstat if the U.S. government would engage with them
                    to try to resolve these court cases and pay the claims. The result was a German
                    industry initiative to create a foundation, which would make payments to
                    surviving, forced laborers. The U.S. government would be asked to intervene to
                    end the lawsuits against Germany arising out of World War II and the National
                    Socialist regime. Stu Eizenstat agreed with this proposal, and negotiations were
                    launched in May of 1999. There was a series of 18 plenary sessions, including
                    members of the German industry initiative who began this process with some 17
                    leading German companies. To that mix were added the five reconciliation
                    foundations that the Germans had financed in the 1990s for humanitarian purposes
                    with the Ukrainians, the Russians, the Czechs, and the Poles. The Conference on
                    Jewish Material Claims Against Germany joined them as the institutions that
                    would actually make the payments to individuals. The State of Israel also joined
                    the process, along with the American Gathering of Holocaust Survivors and the
                    Centre of Organizations of Holocaust Survivors in Israel. Throughout the
                    negotiations dozens of plaintiffs' attorneys who had filed the class-action
                    lawsuits were fully engaged.</p>
                <pb facs="0185" n="Page0185"/>
                <p>We began these negotiations in Bonn. As the government of Germany was moving the
                    capital to Berlin, we were meeting in the old Foreign Office in Bonn. At one
                    count, I saw 125 people in the room negotiating on such topics as eligibility of
                    concentration camp victims for payments versus agricultural workers, who were
                    forced laborers but were not industrial forced laborers and should not be paid
                    by industry. There was a whole host of other historical injustices that had been
                    brought to victims.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think that some of this also would have stirred up
                        a group of people, the predatory lawyers. If there is an airplane crash,
                        before the pieces of the wreckage hit the ground, you have lawyers waiting
                        to get the names of the victims. We would call them “ambulance chasers.” Was
                        there the equivalent to this there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: In fact, the 1996 class action lawsuits against the Swiss banks had
                    encouraged such action by other plaintiffs' attorneys. In the end, there were
                    more than 100 plaintiffs' attorneys in this case, from some of the most
                    reputable firms to some small-town, small-time individual lawyers trying to
                    engage themselves in this process. We had the whole entire range. They were
                    certainly a formidable group. The argument and the negotiating itself were
                    fascinating because it was no longer a government-to-government negotiation. It
                    was a government-led negotiatioon the German side first by Bodo Hombach, a
                    special appointee of Chancellor Schroeder, followed by Dr. Otto Graf Lambsdorff,
                    the former economics minister. On the U.S. side, the negotiations were led by
                    Stuart Eizenstat, first in his role as Undersecretary of State and then as
                    Deputy Treasury Secretary. There were NGOs, plaintiffs' attorneys, companies,
                    governments, all at the table negotiating from their own points of view on what
                    was to become an executive agreement between the U.S. and Germany and a joint
                    statement by all the parties in support of that executive agreement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was this type of negotiation chosen? There had been a
                        series of governmental agreements before. Was this the outcome of looking at
                        how other agreements had been reached and we figured this would be the best
                        way to go about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0186" n="Page0186"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: That is a very good question. Traditionally, issues of this kind
                    would be resolved in treaty negotiations at the end of a war and be considered
                    reparations. However, Germany had been divided and consequently, compensation
                    and restitution took place in the West under the national laws of West Germany.
                    It did not take place in East Germany. So, when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989,
                    there was still unfinished business from the National Socialist regime. By the
                    time Germany was united a year later, there were questions about what was not
                    complete. Who were the victims who didn't receive compensation? We thought in
                    1990 that Secretary James Baker and Mr. Robert Zoellick and others had resolved
                    this issue by having an exchange of letters between Secretary Baker and German
                    Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher. Mr. Genscher promised to continue the
                    compensation programs of West Germany from the Cold War period into the
                    post-Cold War period and a unified Germany. These programs were extended after
                    1990. There also were negotiations for an individual, Hugo Princz, which became
                    a global agreement dealing with compensation for Americans who had been caught
                    in concentration camps. And for humanitarian purposes, the Germans financed
                    these five institutions, the foundations in the former Soviet Union and Central
                    Europe, that later became part of our negotiations for forced labor
                    compensation. But we did not negotiate a formal peace treaty in 1990. The “Two +
                    Four” agreement on the unification of Germany was titled the final agreement on
                    the unification of Germany. The reopening of the London Debt Agreement of 1953
                    to renegotiate reparations was politically unacceptable to the Germans. The
                    German proposal for an Iranian Claims Tribunal-like solution with the U.S.
                    waiving the claims of Holocaust survivors in the U.S. for acts committed during
                    the Nazi regime was not politically acceptable to the United States. Those
                    decisions led to the creation of the multi-party talks, the format was to have
                    all the parties at the table. That format necessitated plenary sessions, coupled
                    with countless bilateral negotiations with each of these groups, which became
                    very heated.</p>
                <pb facs="0187" n="Page0187"/>
                <p>The agreement itself was very straightforward. The German Foundation Initiative
                    proposed a foundation that would make payments to victims according to German
                    law that would create a foundation based on the negotiation. Since waiving the
                    rights of Americans to sue was not acceptable, the U.S. Government would
                    develop, through this negotiation, a commitment to issue “statements of
                    interest” in court asking that the cases against German companies for acts
                    arising out of World War II and the National Socialist era be dismissed not for
                    legal reasons but on any valid legal grounds. More importantly for us, because
                    it was in the U.S. foreign policy interest, this committed the U.S. to make a
                    political statement in court in support of dismissal. That negotiation began in
                    May 1999. By October, the question of how much money was the focus. The amounts
                    started with the plaintiffs' attorneys asking for $30 billion and the German
                    side looking at $1-1.5 billion, which was a very large gulf. In October, the
                    first serious proposal from German industry and government was for DM 6 billion,
                    about $3 billion. Then by December 17, 1999, an agreement was reached when the
                    plaintiffs' attorneys accepted DM 10 billion. In that process, the German
                    companies were joined by the German government to share the DM 10 billion and to
                    create a joint public foundation supported by contributions of DM 5 billion from
                    the German government and DM 5 billion from the German industry. The inclusion
                    of the German Government to create a German public foundation made it possible
                    for the U.S. to engage in an executive agreement. We couldn't make an agreement
                    between the U.S. government and a private party — the Remembrance,
                    Responsibility and Future Foundation — but we could if it were set up as public
                    foundation with the German government. An agreement between the German
                    government and the American government was in the making.</p>
                <p>By December 17, 1999 we achieved the first major element of our agreement, a
                    capped amount of money ten billion German Marks. But more important politically
                    was that this was coupled with the statement by German president Johannes Rau.
                    He met in Schloss Bellevue, his residence in Berlin, with victims and in their
                    presence said that Germany recognized what had happened to these people, the
                    suffering they have gone through, and asked their forgiveness for what was done
                    in the name of the German people. It was a very powerful political reaffirmation
                    that gave meaning to the amount of money — a dignified payment — that would be
                    distributed among the people. We were all very happy at that point. We thought
                    we had achieved a tremendous breakthrough and we would soon be paying money.</p>
                <p>The next issue was the allocation of that money. There, we began to find that the
                    divisions among Europeans and the emotions stemming from the horrors of the
                    Second World War were still very strong. The deal was struck at DM 10 billion.
                    In the meantime, eight competing entities were looking for money; we had added
                    the International Organization for Migration headed by Brunson McKinley, a
                    former Foreign Service Officer and U.S. Ambassador to Haiti, that would make
                    payments through the International Organization of Migration to the rest of the
                    world. The other foundations would deal with their own constituencies in Eastern
                    Europe or in the Jewish community worldwide. So, the allocation debate began
                    with DM 10 billion on the table.</p>
                <pb facs="0188" n="Page0188"/>
                <p>December 17, 1999, Mr. Eizenstat and Mr. Lambsdorff decided to send me and German
                    Deputy Legal Advisor Michael Geier of the German Foreign Ministry to meet with
                    various parties in Eastern Europe. We met with Eastern Europeans together as
                    they worked out a proportional system themselves and sought to determine what
                    the numbers of beneficiaries based on an earlier accounting that had been done
                    about the numbers of surviving forced laborers. Then the Jewish group, which was
                    made up of the World Jewish Restitution Organization, the Claims Conference, the
                    Jewish Agency, the State of Israel, and two survivor organizations, the American
                    Gathering of Holocaust Survivors as well as the Centre of Organizations of
                    Holocaust Survivors in Israel. The negotiations became very heated. The parties
                    themselves began to discuss not money, but who suffered more. Differentiation
                    between slave and forced labor became a very contentious issue. Slave labor
                    referred to those people who were slated for extermination, mostly Holocaust
                    survivors, but also including the Sinti, Roma and some Polish groups in the
                    eastern part of Poland run by the German occupation forces. By the middle of
                    March, we had been able to achieve an allocation between not only the individual
                    slave laborers, who were to receive a total of DM 8.1 billion, but with the
                    remainder of the money to be spent on insurance, on other personal injuries, on
                    property issues, and set aside DM 700 million for a “future fund,” which would
                    be an endowment created to fund programs to fight anti-Semitism and nationalism,
                    hatred, promote the relationship between the Europeans. The Future Fund was a
                    very positive and forward-looking idea that was proposed by the German industry.
                    By the end of March, we had reached basically an agreement. We, the U.S., had a
                    separate fund of relief money that we were giving to various projects and
                    decided that we could help this process along by giving some of that money, $10
                    million, to the Polish group that had a category of people who were not covered
                    by the German legal definitions. So, the U.S., separately from the German
                    agreement, made a small contribution to seal the deal. In the end, working with
                    my political assistant, Jody Manning, we had a spreadsheet that we ran
                    repeatedly with various combinations. When we found the division of money
                    between the East Europeans, particularly the Polish numbers, and the Jewish

                    we ended the discussion and sealed the deal. It was a dramatic moment.</p>
                <p>We then had to deal with insurance issues. Those talks went long into the night.
                    On the insurance side, we decided throughout the negotiations to support the
                    international commission that had been established to deal with unpaid insurance
                    claims from this ermostly those of heirs of Holocaust victims who had died in
                    Auschwitz or other camps who were unable to makes claims or who, when they made
                    claims, did not get paid for their insurance policies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just for background, had most of the insurance firms more

                <p>BINDENAGEL: Indeed, the companies involved were primarily those in Eastern
                    Europe. There were fewer German than Italian firms in Eastern Europe because
                    German firms after World War I were not allowed to issue policies in Central
                    Europe. Primarily, companies like Allianz AG inside Germany, Allianz in
                    particular because its CEO went on to become Adolf Hitler's economics minister,
                    as well as Italian firms like Assicurazioni Generali were caught in the web of
                    non-paying companies. Other companies were in SwitzerlanZurich, Basler,
                    Winterthuand French companies also didn't honor insurance policies. These
                    companies, like the German companies at the time of the initiative on forced and
                    slave labor, had also come together to make an initiative and signed a
                    memorandum of understanding with the Jewish groups and with the American
                    insurance regulators to try to resolve the unpaid insurance policies. That MOU
                    created the international commission. Former Secretary of State Larry
                    Eagleburger was called to chair that. In the German context, the German
                    companies had asked that they be included in the German foundation settlement.
                    As a result of the negotiations within the International Commission on Holocaust
                    Era Claims (ICHEIC) and the German Foundation negotiators, DM 550 million were
                    set allocated to ICHEIC from the ten billion German Marks for insurance claims.
                    The international commission was asked to make the insurance payments. In the
                    meantime, the companies had evolved; Germans had bought Italian companies.
                    Italian companies bought German companies. French companies bought others. So,
                    it was really very European and it was very difficult to sort out what was a
                    German company versus a French company.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have an agreement on restitution in France?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0190" n="Page0190"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: The French indeed had denied any responsibility for the acts of the
                    Vichy Regime through 1994. President Mitterrand argued as late as 1994 that
                    Vichy was not France and that the real French were in the South of France during
                    the war. In 1995, President Chirac reversed that policy and began an historical
                    effort to understand what rules and regulations the Vichy regime itself issued,
                    versus those issued by the occupying National Socialists. Vichy restitution
                    talks in France were running parallel to the German negotiation the entire time.
                    In that case, since we had established this process throughout Europe, I went
                    from the negotiations in Germany to France where we had an inter-ministerial
                    group for this issue. In France, it was very fascinating. I had begun with the
                    discussion on Nazi confiscated art held in the MNR collection with the French
                    and we created an inter-ministerial working group in the Prime Minister's
                    office, including the Quai d'Orsay, the foreign office, and other ministries. We
                    basically consulted on the historical commissions' in Europe and on the German
                    negotiations. The French explained what they were doing, and what proposals they
                    had for spoliation claims adjudication and for a French Shoah Foundation. We
                    discussed the restitution of Nazi confiscated art and the implementation of the
                    Washington Principles on Nazi-confiscated Art. The French were particularly
                    interested in the German proposals and how the German negotiations proceeded.
                    The French shared their historical research with us. The deputy of the
                    historical commission, the medical doctor Ady Steg, came to visit the U.S., met
                    with the U.S. state treasurers and the Congress. Alan Hevesi, the comptroller of
                    New York City, hosted a monitoring group of U.S. State Treasurers who controlled
                    billions in investments, including in France. Steg explained the progress on
                    French historical research and also met with Representative Jim Leach and
                    explained to Congress what the French were doing. In the end, the French
                    developed a claims commission to deal with claims arising out of Vichy and they
                    created a national foundation for the remembrance of the Shoah, very similar to
                    the German Future Fund.</p>
                <p>Going back to the negotiations with the Germans, after having the allocation
                    issue resolved, we then moved to the issue of reparations involving American
                    POWs, and others who felt they might have an issue to raise. We had taken
                    reparations until 1947/48 when the Cold War descended on us and we ended the
                    seizure of Nazi German property to be used for reparations. It was our view,
                    throughout that reparations should not be reopened. We agreed that the U.S.
                    would not raise reparations, although there may be actual claims.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This could not have set well with some veterans
                        groups.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Actually, although there was some discussion, we had strong support
                    for this provision, although I say that today. It has not played much of a role,
                    although there were some efforts to raise the issue.</p>
                <pb facs="0191" n="Page0191"/>
                <p>Then we concluded the negotiations with the Germans on an agreement to end the
                    lawsuits and help achieve legal peace. Legal peace was the essence of the deal
                    for the Germans. They wanted to find a remedy for all claims in order to be able
                    to conduct business in the United States unimpeded by World War II lawsuits. It
                    took from May through October 2000 to deal with legal peace before we were able
                    to craft the statement of interest principles that will be used to dismiss cases
                    against German companies in U.S. courts. Despite the brilliant negotiation of
                    Stu Eizenstat, both with the German companies and the U.S. Department of Justice
                    the talks went to the very last moment of July 17th, 2000, when we met in Berlin
                    to sign the executive agreement, which was signed at the same time the joint
                    statement. That morning was dramatic. Ed Fagan, a plaintiffs' attorney,
                    announced that he would not sign because he had outstanding issues. Actually, he
                    was wired for television and was grandstanding for news special. Stu Eizenstat
                    and Fagan screamed at each other until Fagan relented. Then we gathered with the
                    German delegation and the German industry representative, Manfred Gentz, stated
                    that he knew what he had to do that day — sign the agreement — but he also had
                    some unfinished business to keep on the table. Stu Eizenstat tried to negotiate
                    the issues and the ceremony was delayed. The misunderstanding turned ugly with
                    an exchange — also misunderstood — that the U.S. was dictating the terms of the
                    agreement. This led to a retort that Germans had experience with dictators, not
                    the U.S. In the end the exchange was set aside to be raised later as the
                    delegations moved to the Weltsaal of the Foreign Office to sign the executive
                    agreement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is legal peace?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Legal peace in an ideal situation would mean that no more cases could
                    be brought in U.S. courts against German companies for crimes arising out of
                    World War II. In the legal system that we have, the Anglo-Saxon system, we don't
                    waive the rights of citizens to raise cases, but we have intervened to make sure
                    they're dismissed by the courts on any legal grounds. The conflicting legal
                    systems in Europe and the U.S. Civil law and Roman law remained unresolved. Only
                    the dismissal of the cases would end the debate.</p>
                <p>The next phase in the implementation of the executive agreement with Germany was
                    to dismiss these cases. On July 17, 2000, through the end of the administration,
                    through the beginning of the next administration, until May 30, 2001 we fought
                    with the courts to resolve these cases. In the end, there were perhaps as many
                    as 100 class action lawsuits that were dismissed. But not without a little
                    drama. The court cases were divided into three kindinsurance, banking, and
                    forced labor. Forced labor cases and insurance cases were dismissed in the fall
                    of 2000 by individual judges. The third judge, Judge Shirley Wohl Kram in
                    Manhattan, was not prepared to dismiss the cases against the banks. She asked
                    for a special master to review what we had done. In the meantime the German
                    parliament passed the law creating the new German Foundation “Remembrance,
                    Responsibility and Future” which would make payments as soon as the cases were
                    dismissed.</p>
                <pb facs="0192" n="Page0192"/>
                <p>The special master, plaintiffs' attorneys, the defense attorneys, the U.S.
                    government, all asked her to dismiss the cases, and she refused. At that point
                    in the spring of 2001, after the administration had changed and Secretary Powell
                    had asked that I stay on as special envoy, we went back to court. The
                    plaintiffs' attorneys and the U.S. government joined together with the defense
                    attorneys to ask for a writ of mandamus to remove the judge from the case and to
                    have it heard in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the feeling that the judge had a particular point of
                        view ointerest in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: She had had a separate case dealing with Austrians. She was told in
                    that case that the German banks would pay the Austrian claims. When the German
                    banks said, “No,” she felt that this case would be the way to force the German
                    banks into the negotiation. At one point, she had a hearing, but the cases were
                    not dismissed.</p>
                <p>Normally, a U.S. judge would be represented by the Justice Department in such a
                    mandamus case. However, the U.S. Government had joined in the request for the
                    writ of mandamus and Judge Kram hired David Bois, who was Al Gore's lawyer in
                    Florida, to defend her. David Bois defended her in the Second Circuit, including
                    the decision that she had ordered the German Bundestag to renegotiate the
                    agreement and change the German Foundation law, a decision that had gone far
                    into the President's foreign policy making powers for which she had no right
                    tread.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: In the end, the Second Circuit of the Court of Appeals ordered the
                    dismissal of the court cases against the German banks. Soon afterward the German
                    Bundestag declared that “adequate” legal peace was achieved and payments should
                    begin. The industry money was transferred to the foundation in stages and with
                    much Sturm und Drang in the Board of Trustees meetings. Nevertheless, within the
                    first year of its operation, some 1,033,000 surviving forced laborers have
                    received the first of two payments, totaling $1.8 billion.</p>

                <p>BINDENAGEL: It is a tragedy that so many people died before this effort could
                    reach them. However, our effort did reach those still alive or the heirs of
                    victims who were eligible — all those alive after the German industry announced
                    their foundation initiative on February 19, 1999.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: I think that we owed it to the victims to reach out after the fall of
                    the Berlin Wall to recognize their suffering and it was certainly in our foreign
                    policy interest to promote economic relations with the Europeans by ending the
                    class action suits and establishing the basis for reconciliation among the
                    former belligerents of World War II. We could only reach the living; if we
                    sought heirs probably half of Europe would be heirs. It would not have been
                    possible and would have implied that the suffering of forced workers could be
                    inherited.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: When Stuart Eizenstat asked me to join his forced and slave labor
                    negotiations after I had successfully managed the Washington Conference on
                    Holocaust Era Assets, he asked for one reason. He asked that I become his
                    diplomatic advisor because of my 25 years of diplomatic experience in Europe.
                    The rest of the American team was made up almost exclusively of lawyers. Stuart
                    Eizenstat is also a lawyer. We had two lawyers from the Legal Adviser's Office,
                    Ronald Bettauer and Eric Rosand and two lawyers from the Justice Department,
                    David Anderson and David Bucholz from the Civil Division. So, on the U.S. side,
                    there was an almost exclusive focus on legal remedies for political problems and
                    moral problems. So, inside our own group, we had a tremendous tension as I
                    defended the principle of the primacy of politics. We tried to even out the
                    issues of political necessity, or what was important politically versus what was
                    feasible in legal terms.</p>
                <p>What was really remarkable was the drafting of the elements of the U.S.
                    “statement of interest,” which became an issue of major contention between the
                    State and Treasury with Stu Eizenstat on one side and the Justice Department. I
                    recall several meetings with Seth Waxman, the Solicitor General, when he would
                    sit down and look at the efforts by Stu to get strong language to dismiss the
                    cases and say: “But this is not a legal theory. We're not intervening for a
                    legal reason. We're intervening because of foreign policy reasons” - which is
                    exactly what we were trying to do.</p>
                <pb facs="0194" n="Page0194"/>
                <p>The U.S. Military Government began a compensation program for Nazi victims in its
                    zone of West Germany with Occupation Law 59 in 1947. We had, as policy for 50
                    years, sought compensation for victims, as recently as through the
                    Baker-Genscher exchange of letters in 1990. The government lawyers approached
                    this as a foreign claims settlement issue. If victims had a claim, how much time
                    did they work in the camps? How much money should they receive of this? The
                    plaintiffs' attorneys made that case very strongly that the victims could relate
                    economic value of their forced labor. In the end, my view was that no amount of
                    money could compensate the victims; you couldn't place an economic value on any
                    of their forced labor. The Germans tried to avoid legal responsibility by
                    casting the payments as “humanitarian” and set eligibility along those lines to
                    strengthen their legal case. At one short point in the talks the industry,
                    trying to weigh in on behalf of the victims in Eastern Europe proposed the idea
                    that the payments (to double victims) could be needs based payments. So, in
                    Eastern Europe, you could reach a lot of people, but those in Western Europe and
                    the U.S. shouldn't really get much payment because they didn't need it and that
                    the really needy were those who were behind the Iron Curtain, who had not
                    received any compensation earlier. That proposal was roundly attacked as
                    differentiating suffering among victims and was immediately rejected, in
                    particular, by the Jewish groups, who asked that victims in the two classes —
                    slave and forced laborers — be treated equally in each group as a major
                    principle. That proposal led to a heated debate over the differentiation between
                    those who were slave laborers, getting three times as much as Eastern European
                    forced laborers. This also was a very contentious discussion between the Poles,
                    in particular, and the Jewish groups with the two American and German
                    governments being accused of unleashing historical grievances by these two
                    against each other.</p>
                <p>Another facet of the victims' suffering was when Graf Lambsdorff argued against
                    based for agricultural laborers, saying that according to testimonials he had
                    heard, forced labor in agriculture was one of the best times in the lives of
                    people, but the Poles attacked Lambsdorff directly for the Germans prejudice
                    against Poles and for reviving antagonisms that existed in Germany. Although we
                    were seeking reconciliation and trying to find political ways to lay the basis
                    for it, the talks focused almost exclusively on legal issues. My job was to keep
                    the political issues form getting pushed out, to say nothing of the moral issues
                    and human rights. I kept reminding the parties that we were there to seek a
                    measure of justice and asked whether payments for justice can restore people's
                    lives?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's all you have. The only way you can compensate
                        people can make statements and say “We're sorry,” but beyond that, if you're
                        going to do something, it really is money.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0195" n="Page0195"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: That's correct. Money without the apology is too crass and not
                    valuable for reconciliation. President Klestil in Austria followed President
                    Rau's December 17, 1999 statement with his own on the occasion of our signing
                    the Austrian forced labor agreement on October 24, 2000. Also Prime Minister
                    Jospin and his predecessor, Alain Juppe, and Chirac made apologies recognizing
                    what had happened in France. But even there, apology is not enough if the
                    victims are forgotten. We supported the German Future Fund in the German case
                    and the National Foundation for the Remembrance of the Shoah in the French case.
                    Simone Weil, an Auschwitz survivor, heads the French foundation up. In the
                    German case, the Future Fund is part of a foundation that is overseen by a group
                    divided equally between victims and German representatives. So, the agreements
                    that we reached for money and legal peace were clearly not sufficient. Apology
                    is helpful. But really the success is whether or not the memory can be made to
                    do the historical research and whether you can actually prevent such horrors in
                    the future. That's the really frustrating part, whether or not greater
                    understanding can combat the xenophobic nationalism and ethnic cleansing as we
                    saw in Yugoslavia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can reconciliation be reached between the Jews and the
                        Poles.Gomulka at one point had played this up during his regime in
                        Poland.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You must have been a little bit like the skunk at the
                        wedding. I can see a diplomat sitting with a bunch of lawyers and saying,
                        “Well, look, you've got to look at the political relationships,” where
                        lawyers are not trained to think about them at all. They're looking at the
                        bottom line and compensation and this other stuff is superfluous.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: That is indeed the role that I had to promote the primacy of politics
                    with a group of highly skilled lawyers. I the diplomat was the odd man out.
                    Nevertheless, our successes are measured in different ways. U.S. policy was
                    stated in filings in court as the policy to seek a course of justice for the
                    victims, but also to find cooperative, non-confrontational solutions outside
                    litigation. By keeping that little phrase, we shifted the emphasis from going to
                    court to make these decisions, and to getting the lawyers to accept that
                    whatever settlement we had, they would have to defend in court, but the
                    settlement would be made at a table, not in the court. It was made in the court
                    in the Swiss case and was very long in coming and the payments were made very
                    late. Four years after the settlement was made in the Swiss case, the payments
                    began.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You must have felt the clock ticking.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0196" n="Page0196"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Absolutely, constantly. Ten percent of the survivors die each year.
                    Most of the people were over 80 years old. There was a very strong sense of
                    urgency. Justice and urgency were the two themes that we put into the
                    discussion. You couldn't reach justice if you didn't have any survivors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With this lawyer' group, they're trained to be pugnacious.
                        I would think that it would be hard to get them to concentrate on the real
                        issue, which is time. The basic idea can come across. Yes, there will be
                        payments made. These are the people to whom we're going to be paying. And
                        yet the natural combativeness of people trained in the legal profession
                        would be?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Absolutely. One of the lessons we learned from the Swiss case was to
                    put the allocation process in the negotiation. The Swiss allocation process
                    lasted two or three years. We did it from January to March, three months. Many
                    of the things were done to make sure that the lawyers would not have any basis
                    on which to raise new issues and delay the process. Even then when we did this,
                    the federal judge in New York delayed the process on her own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One judge can do that. But our role was only one of a
                        number.Was that just keeping us delayed or did it delay the whole
                        process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: The process was interlinked. No money was transferred for the victims
                    until all court cases were dismissed. That was a condition of the deal and the
                    judge had tremendous power to block and delay payments to survivors, which she
                    did. Even after the decision, other efforts were made to reopen the court cases
                    that had been decided, to delay further, and to ask for more money. It was a
                    very difficult process to implement even after the agreement had been made.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Stu Eizenstat worked with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Stu was looking for me to provide the diplomatic connection, to win
                    over the Europeans to support this process. So, what I did was stay on after the
                    negotiation sessions in Germany, to go in advance of the meetings in Germany,
                    meet with the constituents in the German industry, government, and media. I gave
                    interviews; spoke to groups of various kinds, the Industry and Trade Chamber in
                    Munich and newspaper roundtables to try to explain in a public diplomacy way
                    what we were doing. At the same time I met with Bundestag members and with the
                    German government officials to explain the background of the positions that were
                    being taken, particularly by our lawyers. By the time we came into the
                    negotiating room, the discussion could be focused on actual solutions.</p>
                <pb facs="0197" n="Page0197"/>
                <p>Very often, I proposed compromises, but did it in a normal diplomatic way. I
                    proposed the compromises to each side individually. Then when they came up with
                    their own proposal, which was similar, it was theirs, and they were actually
                    able to come to agreements on allocation, on reparations. Those were issues that
                    both sides were adamant about, but you could find ways to recast the
                    discussions. It was not to waive reparations. We weren't going to do that. Could
                    you accept not raising reparations? My role was to try to find alternatives that
                    were not legal, but that would provide a compromise that would get the payments
                    to victims and cases against the companies dismissed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there counterparts to you on the German side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: As it developed, the deputy legal adviser at the German Foreign
                    Ministry, who was doing the legal work for them, became Lambsdorff's deputy.
                    Michael Geier, a Foreign Service officer and Deputy Legal Advisor became my
                    counterpart. I came to find him to be the best sounding board for ideas and to
                    understand what the German industry lawyers were saying and how to craft the
                    responses to official communications between Deputy Secretary Armitage and Graf
                    Lambsdorff. This informal communications with e-mail with documentation allowed
                    us to share papers between the two governments, so that we could understand what
                    positions were being made.</p>
                <p>Once the foundation was established, Stuart proposed that I be the U.S.
                    government trustee, so I became one of two Americanthe other American being one
                    of the plaintiffs' attorneyon the foundation board of trustees. We then
                    established all the foundation policies, resolved the issues of eligibility such
                    as that of Italian Military Internees who were captured after the Italians
                    switched sides and became prisoners of war in the German Reich. Some of the
                    Italian forces fought with the Hitler forces, but most were forced into labor
                    and many were shot.</p>
                <p>My role was really to deal with the Europeans on all the Holocaust issues, not
                    just the labor negotiations. Therefore, I went to Brussels, the European
                    Commission, on a few occasions, and met with the Belgian, Austrian, and Swedish,
                    French historical commissions as well as their governments. The three
                    negotiations that we had with the Germans, Austrians and French were all
                    interlinked. I had to ensure that the agreements would have political support
                    and then public support, particularly public support in German, which sustained
                    the willpower of the industry to complete what they had begun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there other blocs? You had your New York judge. Were
                        therequivalents elsewhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0198" n="Page0198"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: The group that was most difficult was the German industry's legal
                    working group, which operated under continental law, seeking principles rather
                    than precedents, and became very difficult. They intervened and blocked the
                    German government from making compromises. They would demand things that weren't
                    possible. They made interventions in court. Anything that passed between the two
                    governments would likely end up in court as an argument on behalf of the
                    companies, even when the points really were not pro-company arguments. For
                    instance, the exchange of letters between President Clinton and Chancellor
                    Gerhard Schroeder were used in court filings in Florida shortly after they were
                    exchanged, although we had not released them. That kind of activity in the
                    tradition of continental lawyers might have been appropriate, but in terms of a
                    diplomatic negotiation, it became very frustrating and difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did embassies and foreign ministries stay out of the

                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any pressure from the State
                        Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: In the Clinton administration we had great and high level support.
                    Stu Eizenstat, particularly after he moved from the State Department to become
                    Deputy Treasury Secretary, was in Clinton's Chief of Staff John Podesta's staff
                    meeting every day. As a result, we had an advocate inside the White House
                    anytime. The President could be counted on to intervene with the German
                    Chancellor whenever it was appropriate and needed. But when the administration
                    changed, Senator Nelson, a newly elected Democrat from Florida who had been the
                    Insurance Commissioner in Florida and was very aware of Larry Eagleburger's
                    efforts in the insurance business, asked Secretary Powell if he would keep on
                    this special envoy. President Bush had announced that he would abolish all
                    special envoys. Since Stu Eizenstat had left, there would be no one to follow up
                    on these issues. Senator Nelson then also asked Mr. Powell if he was going to
                    keep Mr. Bindenagel as special envoy. I did not ask Senator Nelson to do this.
                    In fact, I had other ideas. But Secretary Powell then told me that he would be
                    delighted if I would stay on and implement this process in the beginning of this
                    administration. Beyond that, he then designated Deputy Secretary Armitage to
                    follow and support his effort in implementation. So, it was a change from an
                    activist, interventionist negotiating position of the Clinton administration.
                    With the agreements signed in July 200in the Austrian case, in Octobe200and then
                    in the French case and the Austrian property case, on the last day of the
                    Clinton administratiothe change then became one of implementation. Deputy
                    Secretary Armitage gave a lengthy speech to the Claims Conference in June 2001
                    restating the Administration's commitment to fulfill the executive agreements
                    signed in 2000 and 2001.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, in the final phase, how about payments? When did they
                        starand how was that worked? I keep thinking of these people dying.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Right. The foundations that the Germans had established in the early
                    1990's after the Baker-Genscher exchange of letters had distributed some 15
                    billion German Marks throughout Eastern Europe and they brought into the
                    negotiation the data bank of victims' names they had already researched for
                    about 10 years. In the case of the Jewish Claims Conference for 51 years they
                    had been paying Jewish claims and other special payments under “Article II” and
                    “Hardship Fund” and had names of people who would be eligible. Once the money
                    was transferred and the court cases were dismissed on May 30, 2000 the money was
                    transferred in the summer. Within a few weeks, initial payments were made. They
                    really started in September of 2001. By now, one year later, 1.033,000 people
                    have been paid. So, it really has been a success in the German case.</p>
                <p>The Austrian case is very similar, although the numbers are much smaller. About
                    50,000 people have been paid in the first eight or nine months. In the French
                    case, there are even smaller numbers, but they have an open ended process, so
                    they're trying to identify people, interview them, and capture the oral
                    histories of the victims, as well as making payments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Since this has not ended up in the headlines, I take it
                        that you feel that the whole thing was quite a success. This did not open up
                        all the scars. The wounds will never go away, but it did not reopen them in
                        a major way about how awful things were.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: I am encouraged. I think in the sense of the agreement itself, the
                    money to the victims and the legal peace was a fundamentally sound agreement.
                    But in the process, we also obtained commitments through the Washington
                    Conference, where we began our conversation, to open archives. Historical
                    commissions have begun to research in previously closed archives and to publish
                    that research. We created an International Task Force on Holocaust education,
                    which brings together 13-14 countries to teach what happened in World War II in
                    Europe to their own populations, based on historical research. Finally, the
                    French foundation, the National Foundation for the Remembrance of the Shoah, and
                    the German Future Fund will provide educational and other efforts to preserve
                    the memory and to reach out to try to combat these very human hatreds and
                    intolerance and anti-Semitism. So, yes, I'm encouraged.</p>

                <p>What is interesting for me is that as the Clinton administration left, Stu
                    Eizenstat asked that we apply for an award to recognize this unique effort.
                    David Gergen had solicited candidates for Harvard University's “Innovations in
                    American Government Award.” I applied to Harvard University as the 1,331st
                    application of 1331. The Holocaust Issues Office program was chosen as a
                    semifinalist, one of 17 federal government programs. I understood the
                    “semifinalist” choice as real confirmation of the success we achieved in
                    bringing together NGOs, government officials, lawyers and company executives in
                    negotiation, dealing with human rights issues, corporate citizenship issues, and
                    the courts along with plaintiffs' attorneys and created a way of managing issues
                    that didn't exist before. I think if it proves to be true, then for other issues
                    involving civil society, industry and governmentsuch as the South African Truth
                    and Reconciliation Commission or the Rwandans, or conflict diamonds in Sierra
                    Leonmay find a way to bring together non-traditional diplomatic actions and deal
                    with some very serious issues in a globalized world where political borders are
                    no longer clear dividing lines for negotiations. In that sense, I think that we
                    were successful. I think we've given some thought to an alternative dispute
                    resolution mechanism that should be examined.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had the U.S. and the European governments, all of whom
                        had been involved in the creation of this united Europe. But then you have
                        Israel, which sits outside this. How did they play within this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: The government of Israel had delegated to the Claims Conference and
                    the World Jewish Restitution Organization issues of claims. They didn't deal
                    with this as a claimant. In terms of World War II reparations, they had settled
                    with the Germans in Luxembourg early on and had established excellent relations
                    with Germany after the war. They approached this negotiation with an eye on
                    their constituent basia human rights issue of the first order for Holocaust
                    survivors in Israel. The Israeli Holocaust survivors were very active. They were
                    led by Moshe Sanbar, a survivor from Hungary had been the central banker in
                    Israel. Most Eastern European refugees, survivors from Poland in particular,
                    were very active in this process, especially Noach Flug.The State of Israel
                    supported their efforts and the other institutions that were dealing with assets
                    to which the government had delegated authority?</p>

                <p>BINDENAGEL: No, I've now completed my job as special envoy for Holocaust issues,
                    with the rank of ambassador. As we say in the Foreign Service, no good deed goes
                    unpunished and I have been asked to develop a policy on conflict diamonds and
                    implement a ban on trade in them through what is called the Kimberly process.
                    The Kimberley diamond mine in South Africa has its name attached to the process
                    of eliminating the scourge of conflict diamonds from the legitimate trade. The
                    Kimberley Process is very similar to the forced labor talks with political
                    negotiations among industry, civil society and governments from around the
                    world. In Interlaken Switzerland on November 5 some 37 countries will agree to
                    ban conflict diamonds in accordance with a political declaration negotiated over
                    the last two years. Tomorrow, I'll be at the White House.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Diamonds have become the tribalism that is no longer the
                        majoissue in Africa. It's really oil, diamonds, and timber.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Commodities that are used for financing of legitimate governments or
                    for insurrections. In the short time that I have dealt with this African issue,
                    this has been clearly the case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What has happened to the diamond market with this
                        tightening of control? One can spend $2,000 for an average engagement ring.
                        That was because the DeBeers Corporation controlled the diamond market. I
                        would imagine this proliferation of African dictatorship with diamonds
                        sitting within their borders has screwed up the market.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: That certainly has made the political part of it very difficult. More
                    important is the new discoveries. Canada has very large deposits that have been
                    opened and are sprouting into the market. In the manufacturing side, the
                    polishing side, the Indians have discovered that they have the capability of
                    taking these very tiny diamonds and marketing them. They have created a whole
                    larger audience or client base for diamonds. The Russians have tremendous
                    deposits. What you have are the traditional Antwerp diamond traders of the High
                    Diamond Council and DeBeers in London controlling much of the South Africa and
                    Botswana market. They are very important, but they're not the only actors. There
                    is some movement, although I think DeBeers still controls the African
                    market.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For all the people involved in diamonds, the whole idea is
                        tkeep them rare.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Or to create a bigger market.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything else we should talk about?</hi>

                <pb facs="0202" n="Page0202"/>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: I think we've captured the essence. It is with a great sense of pride
                    that I leave my Foreign Service career. The sense of accomplishment, especially
                    during the 1989 Democratic Revolution in East Germany that led to German
                    unification and the end of divided Europe as well as with the resolution of the
                    victims' issues arising out of the crimes of National Socialism and World War
                    II. Perhaps I can say that I left the world a little better than when I joined
                    the Foreign Service in 1975. Thank you, Stu.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find you were received within the State
                        Department?You were up against all those lawyers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Bureaucracies of any kind do not like innovation and creativity. They
                    are outside the box. Nevertheless, I have received the highest praise from the
                    State Department, a Distinguished Honor Award. The Deputy Secretary has praised
                    the work that I've done. It has created a new basis for lawyers and diplomats to
                    work that has not yet found a place in diplomacy or in government or in the
                    legal profession. As a result, I am not in the center of regular diplomatic
                    activity, but on the cutting edge of the new diplomacy.</p>
                <p>I could end on a note that takes me back to the beginning of my Foreign Service
                    career. Last January, I received a phone call from the Asia Foundation. Having
                    served with you in Korea together in the mid-'70s, I had not returned to Asia
                    since leaving Korea. I was intrigued with the idea that the Asia Foundation
                    would be calling me to talk about something other than German unification. They
                    wanted to know if I would come and give a talk on what the U.S. government had
                    negotiated with the Germans in compensation for World War II forced labor. I
                    told the Asia Foundation that this was a very interesting idea that I in
                    principle would be delighted, but I would of course need to ask the State
                    Department for their views and country clearance. The invitation was issued
                    because Otto Graf Lambsdorff was in Tokyo in February to meet with the regular
                    meeting of the Japanese-German Wise Men Group. The Asia Foundation thought it
                    would be appropriate to make this presentation. I called my friend the DCM Dick
                    Christianson, sent him an e-mail. I said, “Dick, I have this invitation. What do
                    you think?” I contacted the desk, Marlene Sekawe, who used to work for me in
                    Bonn, and said, “I have this invitation. Would you check and see if it's okay?”
                    Positive noises came back from both. I proceeded to say, “Okay, I'd be delighted
                    to come.” Then, two weeks before I was to come, I got a note back from Dick
                    Christianson saying, “We've been talking about this presentation on forced labor
                    here and there is some concern that this might interfere with President Bush's
                    trip. The Japanese are concerned that this might be an issue that we as a
                    government would be raising and your visit has highlighted the issue of comfort
                    women and dealing with the Chinese claims and so on.” I told Dick that I
                    understood that and that if they chose, no worry, I was a good soldier; I
                    wouldn't come.</p>
                <pb facs="0203" n="Page0203"/>
                <p>Shortly thereafter, Chris LeFleur, the Deputy Assistant Secretary in the East
                    Asia and Pacific Bureau, called me and asked me if I could explain what was
                    going on because they needed to decide what to do. I went down to Chris and told
                    him that, “Lambsdorff is there. They're having this meeting. They were planning
                    to invite about 150 people, including members of the Diet and political parties
                    and government, activists, lawyers, all kinds.” I also told him that I had
                    contacted the former Japanese ambassador to Germany, who was a good friend of
                    mine, Tatsuo Arima. Tatsuo was retired and was working for Mitsubishi, which is
                    one of the companies that had been sued former forced laborers employed as World
                    War II victims of the Japanese. I thought it were only appropriate that I
                    understand what the context was before I gave these remarks. Chris thought it
                    would be best if I didn't go. He called the Asia Foundation and found that the
                    Asia Foundation had already extended the invitations. We were faced with the
                    dilemma of what's worse? Going and saying something, or not going and making an
                    issue of it? I went.</p>
                <p>It was a delightful time. I arrived in Tokyo, met with the Deputy Chief of
                    Mission, Christianson. Ambassador Howard Baker was traveling, so I didn't see
                    him. Then I went over to see Tatsuo Arima. Ambassador Arima retired and was a
                    Mitsubishi consultant, but he received me in the Japanese Foreign Office in a
                    not modest office, but a rather grand office with three or four employees in his
                    outer office. He had a huge office. I was quite struck with the message that I
                    was getting. Tatsuo explained to me the sensitivity of the San Francisco Treaty
                    that had ended the War with Japan and was not to be reopened by claims of forced
                    labor. I explained to him our steadfast adherence to that treaty, that anyone
                    covered by that treaty was covered and that was the bedrock of our relationship.
                    He expressed some concern about the historical analogy with the Versailles
                    Treaty and what happened in Europe when that treaty was broken. I thought that
                    was a bit overdrawn, but the message was very clear. I explained to him that Mr.
                    Lambsdorff was here and that the speech would be very straightforward. In fact,
                    the U.S. Embassy had reviewed my remarks. I gave him a copy of the remarks, but
                    he already had one.</p>
                <p>Then during the conversation, something very reminiscent of my old boss and
                    Arima's friend Mr. Holbrooke occurred. The former ambassador to Germany received
                    a phone call, which was loudly announced in the room, as “This is the Foreign
                    Minister calling for you, Mr. Ambassador.” I had only to chuckle. Mr. Arima and
                    Mr. Holbrooke were old friends and they probably learned from each other. The
                    message I got very clearly was, “Don't screw up.” The speech went well and we
                    had a very nice meeting. We had about 130 people attending. Two members of the
                    Diet came but no one from the government. I took a few questions about comfort
                    women and so on. In fact, en route to the speech, I had a call from my office
                    saying that one of the plaintiffs' attorneys in Washington who had done the
                    German agreement found out I was in Tokyo and he was the lead attorney for the
                    comfort women. Would I please call him and perhaps help out with their case? I
                    left a message that he should not expect me to return his call. I felt it was a
                    very good speech with lots of questions and a very interesting discussion.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were no great repercussions.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BINDENAGEL: Three good newspaper articles. I spent a lot of time with one of the
                    journalists explaining what we were doing and I thought it was a very fair
                    discussion with no negative repercussions. Perhaps some thought of opening ideas
                    for the Japanese to consider whatever they choose to do with their problems. The
                    only thing that I noted in this process is that the San Francisco Treaty
                    signatories did not include Korea or China, which could be a problem. That is,
                    one country was not a signatory because it wasn't a country: Korea. Another
                    country is not a signatory to the treaty because there were two of them: China.
                    So, there is an implication for this issue that was settled in bilateral
                    agreements with Korea and China, but it's not one that is taken up by me.
                    Certainly I don't believe the U.S. government is rushing to try to reopen
                    treaties to resolve the comfort women and other cases.</p>

                        FELL, NOVEMBER 9, 1989</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Ambassador J. D. BindenagelFormer Deputy U.S. Ambassador to the German Democratic
                    Republic 1998-1990</p>
                <p>Throughout the year 1989, dramatic events stirred a new sense of freedom in the
                    world and challenged the cold war. Soviet President Gorbachev began his Glasnost
                    and Perestroika experiment. Students in China demonstrated for democracy on
                    Tiananmen Square and were brutally crushed by communist tanks. In the two
                    Germanys, 2 million soldiers still stood face-to-face across the Berlin Wall
                    ready for war. I was in East Berlin, behind the lines, at the American Embassy
                    to East Germany reporting on a democratic revolution that would bring down the
                    Berlin Wall, help end the Cold War confrontation and create a new order, in
                    which Germany emerged once again united, sovereign and strong. On the night of
                    November 9, 1989, the entire world held its breath waiting for the Soviet tanks
                    to roll and crush the German revolutionaries. This is my story of that
                    night.</p>
                <p>The United States throughout the Cold War preached self-determination in an
                    effort to promote democracy movements and stationed millions of American
                    soldiers in West Germany to deter a communist attack. East Europeans had
                    repeatedly tried and failed to find freedom and break the yoke of communist
                    rule. Despite failed attempts in East Germany in 1953, in Hungary in 1956, in
                    Czechoslovakia in 1968, and in Poland in 1980, in the summer of 1989 the Central
                    Europeans tried again.</p>

                <p>At the American Embassy in East Berlin, we knew that the Red Army's response with
                    its million Soviet and East German soldier deployed along the German-German
                    border would determine the success or failure of this new democratic revolution.
                    A Washington Post editorial in August that year reminded us that if the Soviet
                    Union intervened anywhere in Europe to protect its interests, it would do so in
                    East Germany. Nevertheless, some East Germans wanted their freedom and
                    sovereignty and were willing to demand some of their rights guaranteed in the
                    Helsinki Final Act signed by their communist leader, Erich Honecker. These brave
                    souls sought freedom to travel and abolishing the East German travel law became
                    the symbolic cry for political freedom during their revolution. They knew the
                    words of President John Kennedy, that free men everywhere would be proud to call
                    themselves Berliners and they knew President Ronald Reagan's challenge to Soviet
                    President Mikhail Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall. They were testing that
                    strong bond of common destiny in our commitment to the dignity of man, the rule
                    of law, and freedom.</p>
                <p>I was a fortunate eyewitness when the Berlin Wall came tumbling down (Ich war
                    dabei) twenty-eight years after the Walter Ulbricht erected this hated symbol of
                    communism and division. Events in the revolution were breathtaking. Tens of
                    thousands of GDR citizens had fled to the West and a million more were seeking
                    to emigrate. Demonstrations in the streets of Leipzig, Dresden and Berlin
                    threatened the government and by October 18 had led to the ouster of Erich
                    Honecker. The new GDR leader, Egon Krenz, desperately needed to establish
                    control of the government and to win support of the people. We knew events could
                    unravel the stability of the Cold War and our embassy reported on November 6
                    that the GDR Politburo was changing the despised Travel Law and predicted
                    hopefully that if such changes continued, the Berlin Wall would become
                    “irrelevant.”</p>
                <p>Unknown to us in East Germany, President George Bush was told in his November 9
                    morning briefing by Brian Quigley, that the GDR had opened possibilities for
                    freer travel for its citizens and that the Berlin Wall might as a result become
                    “irrelevant,” the term used by the American Embassy's Political Counselor Jon
                    Greenwald report describing developments in the GDR.</p>
                <p>IT BEGAN AS ANY NORMAL DAY IN THE REVOLUTION</p>
                <p>Events during the day were calm, President Gorbachev had ended his visit in honor
                    of the fortieth anniversary of East Germany with a warning about the dramatic
                    events saying; “Those who come too late will be punished by history.” Little did
                    we now that history was about to overtake us. That same evening in Berlin I
                    attended Aspen Institute Berlin Directory David Anderson's reception with the
                    mayors of East and West Berlin, the Allied Military Commanders, East German
                    spy-swapping lawyer Wolfgang Vogel and many others. We were an unsuspecting
                    group of insiders. What was about to happen at the Berlin Wall later on November
                    9, 1989, would be a surprise to us all.</p>
                <pb facs="0206" n="Page0206"/>
                <p>At the end of the reception, East German lawyer Wolfgang Vogel asked me for a
                    ride to West Berlin where he had parked his car. Of course I was pleased to
                    offer him a lift and to seek his assessment of the East German reaction to the
                    changes in November 6 GDR Travel Law that had been rejected by thousands of
                    demonstrators throughout the country. Vogel as Honecker's lawyer was most likely
                    to know the GDR's next steps.</p>
                <p>A few months earlier when U.S. Ambassador Richard Barkley and I visited Vogel at
                    his modest home on the Titi Lake, he told us that the Hungarians would likely
                    allow several hundred East Germans in Hungary escape to the West. The Hungarians
                    had dramatically cut down the barbed wire fence along their border in May.
                    Indeed, the Hungarian border was viewed as an escape hatch from the communist
                    bloc and cutting down the fence launched a flood of refugees in late summer. The
                    Hungarians were about to honor their new commitment to a UN convention on
                    refugees and to ignore their obligations under the Warsaw Pact to return East
                    Germans to the GDR. Vogel would surely clue me in on Politburo thinking about
                    the revolutionaries' demands for free travel rights.</p>
                <p>On our way to the downtown West Berlin's heart on the Ku'Damm, Vogel told me that
                    the GDR attorney's collegium had met November 7-8 and proposed additional
                    changes to the GDR Travel Law. Vogel thought the new changes, not yet announced,
                    would satisfy East Germans' demand for more freedom of travel.</p>
                <p>BACK AT THE AMERICAN EMBASSY</p>
                <p>On my return to East Berlin around seven-thirty, I went directly to the embassy
                    where I found a greatly excited political section. They were stunned by East
                    German government spokesman Guenther Schabowski's statement on television. He
                    had told the world that the Politburo agreed to more changes in the Travel Law
                    and East Germans could get visitor visas quickly (in kurzem) for travel to the
                    West from their local “People's Police” and the GDR would open a new processing
                    center to handle emigration cases immediately.</p>
                <p>Although beyond anything we could have imagined, Schabowski's oral statement was
                    open to widely varying interpretation. NBC anchorman, Tom Brokaw, who attended
                    the Schabowski briefing, asked if this meant the Berlin Wall was open;
                    Schabowski reportedly said, “Yes.” Apparently the East Germans heard; “Travel to
                    the West is possible immediately.” The revolution was spinning out of
                    control.</p>
                <p>We sent one embassy political officer, Heather Troutman, directly to Checkpoint
                    Charlie and another, Imre Lipping, to the GDR press center to get the text of
                    the statement. While we were hunting down the travel law text, the first East
                    Germans, attempting to cross without visas, were sent packing by the guards at
                    Checkpoint Charlie who told them to first get visas. It seemed to us that the
                    GDR guards could keep things under control, while the new procedures were being
                    worked out.</p>
                <pb facs="0207" n="Page0207"/>
                <p>With the text of the announced freedom to travel and emigrate in hand, we
                    translated it and cabled it to Washington. I telephoned the White House
                    Situation Room and State Department Operations Center to make sure they had the
                    report and to alert them to the latest developments. Then I called the American
                    Minister in West Berlin Harry Gilmore, and we diplomats shared our quick
                    assessment of the Politburo announcement. We thought the East Germans would get
                    their visas and then head to West Berlin. Little did we know how quickly the
                    East Germans would test the will of the border police to let them leave and
                    return.</p>
                <p>After assuring ourselves that we had reporting officers in place to follow events
                    and had reported the latest news, I headed home to the near-in East Berlin
                    suburb of Pankow around 10:00 PM. As I drove up Sch�nhauserallee in East Berlin
                    I was surprised to see so many East German, plasticized pressed wood Trabant
                    automobiles seemingly abandoned near the Bornholmerstrasse checkpoint crossing
                    over the S-Bahn train into West Berlin. At the end of the street near the
                    checkpoint, I saw dozens of Germans standing at the barrier and shouting at the
                    guards defending the crossing.</p>
                <p>I knew the crossing well. I crossed it regularly; my children crossed there daily
                    to attend the German-American John F. Kennedy Schule in Zehlendorf, West Berlin.
                    Inside the crossing were barracks filled with armed border police. Fire hoses,
                    like those used later at the Brandenburg Gate were carefully laid out in
                    readiness to repel any wall jumpers. Across the checkpoint safely in the West, a
                    TV camera crew, with its light ready to instantaneously transmit pictures of
                    this confrontation at the bridge around the world, was poised on the bridge.</p>
                <p>I hurried through the last few blocks to get home quickly. Inside, I turned on
                    the television to see which pictures were being beamed at the East Germans from
                    the camera I had seen. My wife Jean rushed in to the TV room worried I would
                    wake our children. I explained the latest events and how our worry seemed to be
                    turning into excitement as we witnessed the fall of the Berlin Wall. I called
                    Ambassador Barkley, Jon Greenwald our political counselor and Harry Gilmore in
                    West Berlin. We knew events would soon envelop us.</p>
                <p>THE BERLIN WALL FALLS</p>
                <p>Within minutes the Berlin Wall was breached. First, a wave of East Berliners came
                    through the Bornholmerstrasse checkpoint signaling freedom for all East Germans.
                    They streamed across and their pictures were flashed around the world. They were
                    free! But I had a sinking feeling. Did they have visas? What happened to the
                    visa requirement? Who was in charge? [Note: The Spiegel TV crew filming the East
                    Germans great escape only reported the first Germans to flee were free. Steven
                    Aust, editor of Der Spiegel told me in October 1996 that he had sent that crew
                    to film the crossing and had later interviewed the guards who let the people
                    into West Berlin. He confirmed that the first to cross into the West had been
                    expelled by the East German guards.]</p>
                <pb facs="0208" n="Page0208"/>
                <p>A few hours later, around 6:30 A.M., Jean called our colleagues, the Jamison's to
                    determine whether Will and Kelly would go to school with Annamarie, my
                    third-grade daughter. When they arrived at our house I joined them as a “follow”
                    car to the school van as they proceeded to Bornholmerstrasse on their way
                    through the crowd to school in West Berlin. Their van moved into the masses of
                    people now streaming in both directions. Seeing the red diplomatic license
                    plate, the people stepped aside to let the American car through the Gate at
                    Bornholmerstrasse. I stood there watching with some uncertainty of their fate as
                    Annamarie, Will and Kelly disappeared through the masses of people into the
                    West. Our son Carl followed in less than an hour.</p>
                <p>Radio DDR Eins announced that visas were required to travel as of 8:00 am on
                    November 10. I stayed at Bornholmerstrasse and as the hour approached the crowd
                    grew larger and pressed against the checkpoint as panic spread among those who
                    had not escaped during the night. The fear of being shut in, of having missed
                    the chance to see West Berlin before the GDR shut the gate was palatable.
                    Shortly before that appointed 8:00 AM hour, that deadline was moved to noon.
                    Later, the noon deadline was revised to Monday. That was the moment authority
                    and legitimacy passed from the Krenz government to the people who had demanded
                    the freedom to travel and won their freedom from communism.</p>
                <p>NO-MANS-LAND AND THE DEATH STRIP</p>
                <p>We were all caught in the blurring pictures of the revolutionary video stuck on
                    fast-forward. Events in those hours overwhelmed us with a mixture of anxiety,
                    euphoria and hope for the future.</p>
                <p>When Annamarie and Carl returned from the John F. Kennedy Schule in West Berlin
                    that Friday afternoon, Jean and I decided that we, too, would test the new
                    openness of the Berlin Wall. Choosing Eberswalderstrasse where the buildings
                    were in the East and the sidewalk was in West Berlin, we ventured down to the
                    Wall.</p>
                <p>The “Bausoldaten,” soldiers on construction duty were deconstructing the Berlin
                    Wall at Eberwalderstrasse. They had already taken several three-meter tall,
                    one-meter wide sections out of the Wall by the time we arrived. Lined up in
                    front of this gaping hole were hundreds of East Germans dutifully waiting for
                    the East German Volkspolizei to issue them visas in accordance with the November
                    9 Schabowski statement.</p>
                <p>We had our diplomatic identity cards and proceeded to enter the no-mans-land
                    through the new crossing point. As we, accompanied by our dog Willi, stepped
                    into the eerie space between East and West, seven-year-old Carl exclaimed;
                    “There are two walls.” Indeed, at the end of the no-mans-land stood towering
                    above us was the whitewashed wall on the western side.</p>
                <pb facs="0209" n="Page0209"/>
                <p>We crossed into West Berlin with numerous East Germans and were greeted with
                    cheering West Berliners and a sense of time suspension. Disoriented we found a
                    playground for our children where they played while Jean and I tried to absorb
                    the strangeness of standing in West Berlin amid so many East Germans.
                    Unification had just happened among the Germans and we were witnessing the
                    mixture of two conflicting systems separated for two generations. Berlin had
                    become an East German city overnight.</p>
                <p>After getting our personal bearings we turned back toward East Berlin and stepped
                    back into the death strip on our way home. As we entered the forbidden zone an
                    East German guard who blocked our way and demanded our passports approached us.
                    When we produced our East German Diplomatic identity cards, he rejected them
                    saying that the crossing was only for citizens of the German Democratic
                    Republic. We argued that we, too, lived in East Germany despite the fact that it
                    seemed incredible that any Westerner would voluntarily lived in that communist
                    country. After some heated dialogue, we were allowed to pass. Stepping back into
                    East Berlin was like wandering into the twilight zone, a country made to
                    disappear by a revolution that swept away walls and soon would sweep away the
                    very existence of East Germany itself.THE END OF EAST GERMANY</p>
                <p>I knew East Germany's days were limited. Only intervention by the Soviets could
                    prolong its agony. President Gorbachev risked Perestroika and Glasnost in Russia
                    if he chose to intervene militarily in the GDR; he would lose East Germany if he
                    did not. Nevertheless, we had no idea of the next steps or how the revolution
                    would play out.</p>
                <p>While the world was caught up in the euphoria of the pictures at the Brandenburg
                    Gate, President Bush instructed us that there would be no dancing on the Wall.
                    The East Germans had won some freedom, but the revolution had unleashed the
                    forces of history contained by the Cold War.</p>
                <p>Meeting with Gorbachev six months later, Gorbachev told President Bush that
                    Germany could decide whether or not to join NATO. In the intervening months the
                    greatest diplomatic venture since World War II was undertaken with the greatest
                    skill. Germany, with the vision and skillful leadership of the American
                    President and Chancellor Kohl, was unified and this millennium may end in peace
                    with Europe whole and free.</p>
                <p>POSTSCRIPT</p>
                <p>There is a postscript to this story that I would also like to share. I felt there
                    were some unanswered questions about those first wall jumpers at
                    Bornholmerstrasse checkpoint. Did they have visas? Just what did those guards
                    with the hoses and rifles do to defend the Berlin Wall on November 9, 1989? A
                    few months after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Jean and I were having coffee with
                    the Uwe Gerson family, friends from our local East German church. Among the
                    guests were East Germans that had been among those at Bornholmerstrasse that
                    night.</p>
                <pb facs="0210" n="Page0210"/>
                <p>As we recounted this story, one of them asked if we knew what actually happened
                    to the first freedom-seekers who burst into the lights of the Spiegel TV cameras
                    and changed the course of history. Of course we did not and were intrigued to
                    hear a first-hand account. Uwe Gerson's brother-in-law took out his GDR
                    identification card, a paper passport with a photograph on one side and his name
                    typed on the other. Across the picture was a GDR exit visa stamp. A stamp that
                    actually invalidated the I.D. card. It hit us. The first people crossing into
                    the lights of the TV camera had been expelled! The GDR had tried to save itself
                    from its discontented citizens by throwing the rascals out of the country. Be
                    gone you revolutionaries, they must have said. The last laugh was on those
                    guards. The television pictures of people held back by a hated system fleeing
                    into freedom were too powerful to resist. The people had taken their fate in
                    their own hands. East Germany fell to the irrepressible human desire for
                    freedom.</p>
                <p>The pictures were enough to rouse other East Germans from their sleep and head
                    for the Berlin Wall. The numbers soon overwhelmed the guards and the East German
                    government's implementation of its exit visa requirement was delayed and
                    delayed. Meanwhile the Germans in the GDR continued their revolution and took
                    ownership of their country.</p>
                <p>CONCLUSION</p>
                <p>American support for German unification allowed the East German's peaceful,
                    democratic revolution success. Soon they would join with the Federal Republic's
                    forty-year-old democracy to create a peaceful, democratic Germany in the heart
                    of Europe. With NATO enlargement, its new members can hope to enjoy some of the
                    same freedom, peace and prosperity found in Germany today. I am proud to say
                    that I was there to serve my country at that exciting time in Germany.JUSTICE,

                <p>The growing shortage of labour also led to a shift in the function of the SS-run
                    concentration camps... Whereas prior to 1942 they had been run primarily as
                    institutions of 'destruction through work,' with the work performed there having
                    no real economic function, they were thereafter used as sources of additional
                    labour for direct and indirect deployment in armaments production.- Neil Gregor

                <p>On orders from my department, I too drove a gas van from Berlin to Minsk. These

                    It was 1942. There were about a thousand Jews in each convoy. With each arrival
                    I made five or six trips with my van. Some of the Jews were shot. I myself never

                <p>It is now therefore even more important that all survivors receive, as soon as
                    possible, the humanitarian payment agreed today. I know that for many it is not
                    really the money that matters. What they want is for their suffering to be
                    recognized as suffering and for the injustice done to them to be named
                    injustice. I pay tribute to all those who were subjected to slave and forced
                    labor under German rule, and, in the name of the German people, beg forgiveness.
                    We will not forget their suffering.-German President Johannes Rau, Statement
                    before Holocaust survivors at Schloss Bellevue in Berlin, December 19,1999</p>
                <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
                <p>Sixty years after millions perished in the horrific events of the Holocaust, the
                    Holocaust continues to serve as an ever-present reminder of what can happen when
                    individuals allow racial, ethnic and religious differences to divide a local,
                    regional and even international community. The images of malnourished men, women
                    and children being worked to death in concentration camps in support of the Nazi
                    war effort, being gassed in chambers and burned like rags continue to haunt and
                    remind us of the importance of tolerance and the need to fight xenophobic
                    nationalism. Fortunately, the end of World War II brought an end to National
                    Socialism and the enslavement of more than ten million people who served as
                    forced laborers in nearly every economic sectomanufacturing, service industry,
                    agriculture, social services. The U.S. occupation authorities launched the first
                    German restitution and compensation programs in 1947 and sowed the seeds for
                    hopes of reconciliation among those nations whose surviving victims' lives had
                    been shattered. Unfortunately a few short years after the end of the Second
                    World War and after West Germany created its restitution and compensation laws
                    that included payments to Holocaust survivors and support for the State of
                    Israel, new compensation programs that could reach the majority of forced labor
                    survivorPoles, Ukrainians and Russians - were no longer initiated.
                    Reconciliation between perpetrator and victim, particularly victims who were
                    behind the Iron Curtain, was set aside with the onset of the Cold War.</p>
                <pb facs="0212" n="Page0212"/>
                <p>The 1948 Berlin Blockade ended the Second World War Great Powers Alliance and
                    began the division of Germany and Europe into competing ideological camps across
                    the Cold War divide. On 12-13 August 1961, the Berlin Wall was erected to serve
                    as a physical barrier dividing Berlin. East Germans viewed the wall as an
                    encroachment on their freedom and fled the country in secret compartments of
                    cars, inside surfboards, in balloons and makeshift planes. Originally erected
                    with barbed wire and cinder blocks, this symbol of divided Europe was later
                    transformed into a massive structure made of concrete walls, topped with barbed
                    wire and guarded with watch towers, gun emplacements and mines. From the time it
                    was erected until its collapse, the wall had at least three major purposes: as a
                    deterrent to the East German “brain drain,” as an “antifascist protection
                    barrier” for the East German government and as an obstacle to restitution
                    efforts in Eastern Europe for surviving Holocaust and forced labor victims. With
                    the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the collapse of the Soviet Union in
                    1991, hopes of reconciliation were rekindled.</p>
                <p>Beginning in 1947 with U.S. Occupation Law 59 and continuing through West German
                    claims processes such as the BEG and Brueg restitution programs as well as
                    Adenauer's Luxembourg Agreement through 1970, U.S. and German governments set
                    about to make compensation and restitution in the West. In addition, the
                    Conference on Jewish Material Claims against Germany was established in 1951 and
                    has continued through unification to administer programs for Holocaust victims.
                    As the heir to heirless Jewish property, it sells the property to make
                    compensation or other payments in the memory of the Holocaust.</p>
                <p>Continuity in German compensation programs was assured by the Baker-Genscher
                    exchange of letters in 1990 at the time of unification. In these letters, which
                    came as the Cold War ended, the German Government assured the U.S. Government
                    with the 1990 agreement on Germany unification, the Final Treaty on Germany
                    (also known as the 2+4 Treaty) that it would continue its compensation after
                    unification and launched a $700 million humanitarian effort in the 1990s for
                    victims in Eastern Europe. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall and dissolution of
                    the Communist East German regime, the U.S. Government has continued to work with
                    the German Government to engineer significant and successful efforts to bring
                    justice to Holocaust and forced labor survivors. In 1998, the United States,
                    France and the United Kingdom established the International Nazi Persecutee
                    Relief Fund (NPRF) for humanitarian relief. Developed in the midst of legal
                    battles and with contributions from countries that had participated in the
                    Nazi-looted gold Tri-Partite Gold Commission, the NPRF, a $60 million fund,
                    assisted victims of the Nazi regime in need of financial assistance and who had
                    received little or no compensation in the past. The United States and likeminded
                    leaders in Germany, Austria, France and others in Europe have worked together to
                    restore victims' property and provide humanitarian payments - not reparations'
                    payments - to victims of the Nationalist Socialist regime, although acceptance
                    of responsibility and apology have not always followed.</p>
                <pb facs="0213" n="Page0213"/>
                <p>In addition to compensation programs, the international community has also taken
                    steps in the late 1990s to address the attitudes that foster intolerance,
                    prejudice, and ethnic hatred. Through the work of the Task Force for
                    International Cooperation on Holocaust Education, Remembrance and Research,
                    individuals are becoming educated about the past in order to prevent future
                    occurrences of violence and genocide. More than 15 national governments are
                    working to support the work of educators in developing curriculum and relevant
                    materials to teach the enduring lessons of the Holocaust. As a result of these
                    actions taken by the international community, the process of reconciliation has
                    accelerated.</p>
                <p>Individuals often consider reconciliation and apology to be synonymous terms.
                    However, defining and achieving reconciliation requires words be accompanied by
                    action. The United States government, along with the international community,
                    collaborated to create a systematic approach to reconciliation for victims of
                    Holocaust injustices: apology, monetary compensation, and preservation of
                    memory. While none of the three alone can adequately address the needs of
                    victims or further reconciliation efforts, together they are capable of
                    facilitating tremendous results. Although this process has been successful in
                    reconciliation for the injustices of the Holocaust, its applicability to other
                    victims of injustices will test its longevity. This is really the challenge
                    facing the politics of reconciliation. This is where this systematic approach to
                    reconciliation for victims of Holocaust injustices: apology, monetary
                    compensation, and preservation of memory will be tested. The critical element is
                    whether payments can reach survivors in their lifetimes and if not, whether the
                    preservation of memory can be the basis for reconciliation.</p>
                <p>Over the past few years, leaders in the United States Germany, Poland, the Czech
                    Republic as well as other Central and Eastern European countries and the State
                    of Israel engineered a significant and successful effort to bring an additional
                    measure of justice to Holocaust and forced labor survivors since the early
                    1950s. Through eighteen months of negotiation culminating in the signing of a
                    U.S.-German Executive Agreement, legislative action in the Bundestag and
                    dismissal of lawsuits against German firms in the United States by U.S. courts,
                    a German Foundation “Remembrance, Responsibility and Future” was created to
                    deliver dignified payments to survivors.</p>
                <p>An official apology from the President of Germany recognized the victims'
                    suffering and asked forgiveness paving the way for reconciliation among
                    perpetrators and victims of the twentieth century's most horrible crime. The
                    Foundation must distribute the money in the survivors' lifetimes and also
                    establish a program in the Future Fund to preserve the memory of those who died.
                    The Foundation also has helped create legal peace for German companies in the
                    United States for crimes arising from the National Socialist era and World War
                    II.</p>
                <p>REMEMBRANCE</p>
                <pb facs="0214" n="Page0214"/>
                <p>Apology cannot come without understanding. Understanding history comes from
                    knowing historical fact. Without the truth history will remain an obstacle to
                    the future. Former German President Richard von Weizs�cker recognized that the
                    unspeakable truth of the Holocaust was, and will remain, part of German history.
                    Nevertheless, in a speech on the fortieth anniversary of the end of the Second
                    World War in Europe, May 8, 1985 he said: “There is no such thing as the guilt
                    or innocence of an entire people. Guilt, like innocence, is not collective but
                    individual.”</p>
                <p>Weizs�cker stressed however, the importance of memory when he said: “All of us,
                    whether guilty or not, whether old or young, must accept the past. We are all
                    affected by its consequences and held responsible for it. Young and old must and
                    can help one another to understand why it is vitally important to keep the
                    memory alive.” Weizs�cker noted that for the victims of the Holocaust the desire
                    to forget prolongs their exile, whereas memory is the secret of redemption.</p>
                <p>The dimensions of the Holocaust and World War II forced labor require careful
                    examination and recognition that historical identity is not fixed. Neither is
                    historical interpretation of a country's past immutable. History is written as
                    much to shed light on the present as on the past. Our understanding of the past
                    reflects our perceptions and evaluation of the present.</p>
                <p>In our search both for justice for survivors and reconciliation between
                    perpetrators and victims, the parties in this process faced daunting twin
                    problems of remembrance and responsibility. Recognition of the horrible
                    suffering of those forced laborers who survived led the United States to two
                    goals: justice for survivors in the form of payments, and making those payments
                    in their lifetimes. The wrongs committed by the Nazis were so horrible in fact,
                    so pervasive in impact, and so injurious to human dignity as to challenge the
                    concept of obtaining justice. The very idea of achieving justice for so many,
                    for such suffering and over such a prolonged period of time was discouraging.
                    Money alone could not compensate the victims for their suffering. It is too
                    crass a commodity of exchange, and, in any event, there is not enough of it.
                    Money could not be the last word on the Holocaust. Survivors insisted that they
                    were not interested in payments alone; there must also be efforts to protect the
                    memory of the Holocaust and the crime of forced and slave labor.</p>
                <p>DEVELOPING U.S. POLICY: REMEMBRANCE AND JUSTICE</p>
                <p>Remembrance of the Holocaust was not only a concern for Germans. Leading American
                    political figures at the end of the twentieth century also recognized that
                    symbolically, the international community needed to reaffirm its commitment to
                    human dignity and resolve 20th century issues before a new century began. The
                    United States could not rely on earlier programs, which did not reach a majority
                    of the surviving victims.</p>
                <pb facs="0215" n="Page0215"/>
                <p>As the international community revisited the history of World War II and its
                    aftermath a consensus for action was shaped in stages from ignorance to
                    awareness, denial to recognition, evasion to acceptance of responsibility,
                    apology to reconciliation and sometimes forgiveness. At the beginning of this
                    long process, ignorance - willful or not - of a conflict and accompanying wrongs
                    needed to be replaced by facts and truth, with all parties, including victims,
                    perpetrators and bystanders participating in the process. Truth is not easy to
                    come by, even in the best of circumstances.</p>
                <p>War and its aftermath obscure, misplace and destroy information. Witnesses,
                    victims and malfeasants are killed or disappear. They grow old and senile. For
                    example, of the two dozen or so senior officials who participated in the January
                    1942 Berlin Wannsee Conference, in which the participants reached consensus to
                    destroy the Jews of Europe, only a few principal perpetrators survived the War,
                    Adolf Eichmann, being most notable.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, research on the unfinished business of restitution and compensation
                    was made possible after the close of the Cold War when newly available archives
                    opened hope that understanding the facts would lead to historical truth. The
                    issues of delayed justice and reconciliation were stirred by a growing awareness
                    that began slowly, in an unexpected way. Suddenly the end of the Cold War made
                    possible commemorations of the Fiftieth Anniversaries of World War II. Although
                    the Fiftieth Anniversary of the September 1, 1939 invasion of Poland preceded
                    the fall of the Berlin Wall, major battles from Stalingrad to D-Day were
                    commemorated. By 1995, after the last Russian troops had departed Berlin and
                    VE-Day was celebrated, attention turned to unfinished business of understanding
                    the full extent of the history of the Second World War.</p>
                <p>Archives opened. Scholarly books began to examine restitution. Lynn Nicholas
                    published The Rape of Europa (1994) and revealed that the Nazis had stolen more
                    than 600,000 works of art during World War II. She noted that while the bulk of
                    looted art had been returned after the war, some artworks found their way into
                    museum collections and private hands instead of being returned to the true
                    owners. Other authors wrote of expropriated or unpaid dormant bank accounts and
                    of unpaid insurance claims of Holocaust victims.</p>
                <pb facs="0216" n="Page0216"/>
                <p>Americans also have recognized the need to understand our own treatment of
                    American citizens by the U.S. Government in the Second World War and to consider
                    action to redress historical injustice. The 1990s were a time of apology. In
                    America, we had already examined events in our own history and offered an
                    apology - and sought the victims' acceptance and reconciliation — as well as
                    their offer of forgiveness. In seeking reconciliation with American citizens,
                    Congress in 1988 had passed a law [Public Law No., 100-383] that apologized on
                    behalf of the people of the United States for the evacuation, relocation and
                    internment of United States citizens or permanent residents of Japanese ancestry
                    during World War II. This apology was accompanied by a payment of $20,000 to
                    each victim. However, good intentions to reach the truth, as Bishop Desmond Tutu
                    observed, are not easy. He said that the truth by itself could sometimes just
                    make people even angrier. With these examples in mind the U.S. negotiators knew
                    from the outset of the negotiations to create the German Foundation that
                    revisiting the history of the Holocaust would prove to be a painful experience,
                    especially for survivors who would relive some of their horrible
                    experiences.</p>
                <p>Openness toward historical truth was a first step toward understanding and
                    reconciliation. The 1998 Washington Conference on Holocaust-Era Assets began a
                    new international effort to open archives and research the past, although
                    openness is never as simple and obvious as it sounds. At the Washington
                    Conference, an international consensus was reached on opening archives. During
                    the Washington Conference delegates of the “Task Force for International
                    Cooperation on Holocaust Education, Remembrance and Research” issued a
                    declaration about the opening of archives pertaining to the Holocaust. The
                    Conference participants endorsed the concept of full archival openness on the
                    Holocaust. The delegates from around the world were determined that the
                    Holocaust is neither to be forgotten nor distorted, and that healing is a solemn
                    duty of all who cherish freedom and human dignity. U.S. negotiators sought to
                    continue the international debate to help guard against biased research that
                    could promote historical local mythologies, ideologies or politics. A notable
                    example of the success of this approach was the Polish government's acceptance
                    of Polish responsibility of a massacre of Polish Jews by Poles at Jedwabne, as
                    reported by Jan Tomasz Gross in his book Neighbors and by the Public Prosecutor
                    Radoslaw J. Ignatiew, of the Polish Commission for the Prosecution of Crimes
                    against the Polish Nation. Acknowledgment of responsibility helps set the
                    standard for truthfulness, acceptance of responsibility and teaching history.
                    Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski, speaking on July 10, 2001 on the
                    Sixtieth Anniversary of the massacre said:“For this crime we should beg the
                    souls of the dead and their families for forgiveness. This is why today, as the
                    President of the Republic of Poland, I beg pardon. I beg pardon in my own name
                    and in the name of those Poles whose conscience is shattered by that crime.”</p>
                <pb facs="0217" n="Page0217"/>
                <p>Historical research was underway throughout the world when the international
                    community gathered in Washington in the fall of 1998. The Vatican offered to
                    open its archives for historical research of the Holocaust in a step toward
                    fulfilling the concept of full archival openness on the Holocaust endorsed at
                    the Washington Conference. The Vatican established a joint research commission,
                    the Jewish-Christian Reconciliation Commission of the Holy See, which was
                    expressly charged to research the Vatican archives for the role of the Catholic
                    Church during World War II. In addition, the Vatican issued a 1998 statement,
                    “We Remember: A Reflection on the Shoah” in which it acknowledged the role of
                    individuals in the Holocaust and took responsibility for the centuries-long
                    persecution of Jews. However, the statement was not fully accepted as an
                    apology. The Jewish-Christian Reconciliation Commission was fraught with
                    contention and demonstrated the difficulty and emotion involved in the search
                    for reconciliation between the perpetrators and victims. Nevertheless, despite
                    the Vatican's commitment to continued research on this period, which is not in
                    doubt, much more historical research from more open archives is necessary to
                    understand the role of the Church in this critical period and to find
                    reconciliation with victims.</p>
                <p>More than 20 countries had established historical commissions to review their own
                    countries' behavior during the Holocaust. The United States' commitment to
                    historical research is manifest in the creation of a Presidential Advisory
                    Commission on Holocaust Assets in the United States, which issued its report
                    early in 2001.</p>
                <p>A year after the Washington Conference, the Swedish government hosted the
                    Stockholm International Forum on the Holocaust in January 2000, inviting the
                    heads of government from European countries, Israel, Argentina and the United
                    States to attend. They declared their commitment to plant the seeds of a better
                    future from the soil of a bitter past. Their commitment was to remember victims
                    who perished, respect the survivors still with us and reaffirm humanity's common
                    aspiration for mutual understanding and justice.</p>
                <p>WHY NOW, SO LONG AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR?</p>
                <p>Why did many Nazi victims and their families have to wait a half-century to
                    receive the kind of recognition and tangible demonstration of remorse - the
                    apology - that they so deserve? Why so much was left undone in the compensation
                    programs at the end of the Second World War? Did not the compensation programs
                    of the post-war period close that chapter of history?</p>
                <pb facs="0218" n="Page0218"/>
                <p>One fundamental reason that these issues were reopened in Europe in the 1990's
                    was that the Cold War that had divided Europe finally ended. Millions of Nazi
                    victims who were beyond the reach of international compensation or assistance,
                    so-called “double victims” who suffered under both National Socialism and
                    Communism, could now be reached. In Western Europe, compensation programs
                    initiated by the United States government during the occupation of Germany in
                    1947 and continued with strong U.S. government encouragement and as a
                    pre-condition for Germany to reintegrate into the community of nations were very
                    different; they reached individuals. Survivors of the Nazi terror benefited from
                    serious efforts to return property, as well as special payment and pension
                    plans. West German government compensation programs were quite extensive, and
                    the Germans continue to pay for these programs today. Over 100 billion German
                    Marks, some 70 billion dollars, have been paid out directly to victims.</p>
                <p>Memory also played an important role in postwar efforts for reconciliation. The
                    horrible suffering of these people was recognized as such, and through education
                    programs and memorials, successive German governments have pledged themselves to
                    bring meaning to the words, “never again.” However, although many programs were
                    implemented in West Europe, survivors in Eastern Europe where most of the
                    survivors lived were not reached as the Cold War division of Europe cut them off
                    from compensation programs. Despite the fact that much effort had gone into
                    compensation between 1947 and 1956, when the “Cold War” was at its most
                    dangerous, new compensation initiatives for material losses ended when the
                    programs were completed in 1970. Nevertheless, Americans and Germans take pride
                    in the knowledge that the early U.S.-led compensation effort from the 1940s
                    continued in West Germany throughout the 1960s and was largely successful, if
                    primarily only in the West.</p>
                <p>However, after the Korean War broke out, political priorities changed and
                    multi-national initiatives to return stolen property to Holocaust victims
                    largely ended. While the San Francisco Treaty was signed with Japan and ended
                    compensation and reparations claims against them, Germany remained divided and
                    questions of reparations and other claims remained open. However, the U.S. role
                    in occupied Germany diminished with the end of the High Commissioner on Germany.
                    With West Germany joining us as an ally, we turned our attention from the
                    aftermath of the terrible and destructive Second World War to deter and, if
                    necessary, to defend ourselves in a third world war.</p>
                <pb facs="0219" n="Page0219"/>
                <p>The situation of the double victims in Eastern Europe finally began to change
                    fundamentally with the emergence of the Solidarity movement in Poland in 1980,
                    the flight of young East Germans through Hungary to Austria to freedom in the
                    West, and with the 1989 Democratic Revolution, which brought the fall of the
                    Berlin Walthe symbol of divided Europe. The 1989 Democratic Revolution in Europe
                    led to the unification of Germany and to the end of the Soviet Union. Those
                    events made it possible for the international community to return to the
                    unfinished business left behind in the 1950s and to reach out to the “double
                    victims” of the National Socialists who were trapped behind the Iron Curtain.
                    Only after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War could those
                    victims become the center of international attention. Only then could the
                    forgotten victims be recognized by an international community looking for ways
                    to address their suffering.</p>
                <p>In the mid-1990s the international public became outraged that so many victims
                    had remained uncompensated for so long after the Second World War. The Swiss
                    case was illustrative. They had developed and believed in the myth that as
                    neutrals they carried no responsibilities for the victims' fate. When asked
                    about possible dormant accounts they responded with an accounting, but denied
                    political or moral responsibility. Consequently, the Swiss banks became the
                    center of an effort to assign responsibility for compensation to Holocaust
                    victims that began to indict other countries. Austria's belief in its own
                    victimhood as the first victim of Nazi aggression came to an end with Chancellor
                    Vranitsky's 1993 declaration that Austria, too, had some responsibilities that
                    it had not met. The floodgates opened with new historical analysis and new
                    lawsuits in the United States against European banks and companies for crimes
                    arising out of World War II.</p>
                <p>PROTECTING U.S. INTERESTS</p>
                <p>The source for the German Foundation lay in negotiations that began in May 1999.
                    While the political fallout of the Swiss obstructionism was clear to all, the
                    German industry moved to accept responsibility and won support of the new German
                    government to propose the Foundation Initiative of German Enterprises in
                    February 1999.</p>
                <p>A key element in the U.S. Government decision to negotiate a new compensation
                    program came after leading German industrialists raised the possibility of
                    negotiations with the newly elected German Government of Chancellor Gerhard
                    Schr�der. Schr�der, who led the Social Democratic Party, which was persecuted by
                    the National Socialists, was very willing to help resolve the forced labor issue
                    with the United States in the fall of 1998. The U.S. Government chose to join
                    the German industry's initiative.</p>
                <p>The U.S. actively intervened to advance broad U.S. policy objectiveof pursuing
                    justice through a number of measures, which included:</p>
                <pb facs="0220" n="Page0220"/>
                <p>First, renewing U.S. sponsorship of justice for victims of National Socialism
                    through a broadly based effort to return property stolen, obtain recognition of
                    suffering, and establish education and social programs in the memory of the
                    victims.</p>
                <p>Second, reminding the international community that the evil forces then tearing
                    at Yugoslavia had relatively recent antecedents and must not be ignored.</p>
                <p>Third, engaging Eastern European countries to reach out constructively to their
                    individual citizens, and also demonstrate in tangible ways what Western
                    democracies - the standard to which the newly independent states of Eastern
                    Europe aspire - have, at their core, fundamental precepts, most especially the
                    sanctity of human dignity.</p>
                <p>Fourth, demonstrating that the international community will holaccountable those
                    who do wrong.</p>
                <p>Fifth, creating international solidarity to address issues which go beyond a
                    single nation's responsibility, and touch each country, including our own, that
                    failed in some way or other to do its utmost to bring justice to the victims of
                    Nazi terror.</p>
                <p>And sixth, encouraging the developing relationship between Germany and the newly
                    free and democratic nations of Eastern Europe at a time when old wounds were
                    complicating their political relations.</p>
                <p>Other forces were at work as well. Plaintiffs' attorneys filed lawsuits in
                    American courts against European businesses operating in the U.S. Some cases
                    were against Swiss banks; other lawsuits alleged that Holocaust victims or
                    surviving forced and slave laborers had not been compensated. More lawsuits were
                    filed against German and Austrian companies in forced labor cases, banking
                    issues, and for unpaid insurance claims.</p>
                <p>Public opinion in the United States began to be aroused and brought intervention
                    from U.S. state banking and insurance regulators, as well as state treasurers,
                    who questioned the way foreign companies, doing business in their states, had
                    managed banking and insurance accounts during the Holocaust period.</p>
                <pb facs="0221" n="Page0221"/>
                <p>The growing interest in justice for Nazi victims through lawsuits and statements
                    by the World Jewish Congress posed a serious threat to U.S. national interests
                    and brought the plight of victims into government action once again. Our
                    relations with our most important partner in Europe, Germany, could have been at
                    risk if no action were taken. For example, court judgments, regulatory
                    sanctions, public boycotts against German companies were distinct possibilities.
                    The German and American economies are too closely linked, too mutually
                    dependent, to ignore any potential disruption. German investment in the United
                    States is responsible for more than 600,000 jobs in America. German industrial
                    investments are the key businesses in several regions of the United States. The
                    operations of more than 1,800 American companies in Germany make vitally
                    important contributions to their economy and ours.</p>
                <p>This litany of potentially dangerous economic consequences does not even address
                    the effect sanctions, boycotts, and court judgments would have on U.S. political
                    and security interests. We also faced the distinct possibility that public or
                    private actions against Germany or its companies likely would result in
                    retaliation against American firms by the European Union. The U.S. Government
                    began to recognize that in reinvigorating its effort to right old wrongs, the
                    United States could advance both important foreign policy objectives, and also
                    ward off a serious threat to U.S. interests.</p>
                <p>It was in this context that in response to German industry and the German
                    government that the United States decided to help untangle the historical
                    injustice of forced labor from the conduct of business in the United States by
                    German firms.</p>
                <p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR HISTORICAL INJUSTICE</p>
                <p>It did not take long to understand that facts and information alone, essential as
                    they are, are not sufficient to resolve the conflicts that like open sores,
                    continued to fester among the victims because of historical injustice. The next
                    equally important step was recognition and acceptance of responsibility for
                    historical injustice. Individuals, groups and governments need to confront the
                    past honestly, without excuses or evasion. German industry voluntarily accepted
                    the historical responsibility of German business during the Third Reich. This
                    German industry acceptance triggered a painful, complex and anguishing
                    negotiation.</p>
                <pb facs="0222" n="Page0222"/>
                <p>The willingness of German industry, under the leadership of Dr. Manfred Gentz of
                    DaimlerChrysler, Dr. Rolf Breuer of Deutsche Bank and Dr. Henning Schulte-Noelle
                    of Allianz, was quite remarkable. In the fall of 1998 when German businessmen
                    first approached the United States and expressed willingness to accept
                    responsibility for German industry in World War II, even when the individual
                    companies established after the Second World War had no legal predecessors to
                    companies that were complicit in the National Socialist crimes, German industry
                    offered to create a new German foundation to make payments to victims. German
                    industry's February, 1999 announcement of the “Foundation Initiative of German
                    Enterprises” to address forced labor and other claims arising out of the
                    National Socialist period launched negotiations among survivors, industry and
                    governments to find a mutually acceptable solution.</p>
                <p>THE NEGOTIATIONS FOR A GERMAN FOUNDATION AND LEGAL PEACE FOR GERMACOMPANIES IN
                    THE UNITED STATES</p>
                <p>The negotiations that led to a U.S.-German Executive Agreement and a Joint
                    Statement of the negotiating parties were not about money and legal peace alone;
                    the United States also sought reconciliation among survivors and the Europeans
                    for injustices arising out of World War II. Holocaust survivors and Eastern
                    European forced laborers, especially Polish, Russian and Ukrainian forced labor
                    survivors who were denied compensation in the Cold War, were joined together in
                    this effort from the start by U.S. efforts to include forced laborers in the
                    negotiations along with Holocaust survivors.</p>
                <p>Reconciliation between the perpetrators and victims; that is, between the Germans
                    and the Poles and the Holocaust survivors was a key aspect of the negotiation
                    and it required creative American diplomacy. In the middle of the negotiations
                    President Clinton wrote to German Chancellor Schr�der on December 13, 1999 and
                    argued that German-American relations are based on our common commitment to
                    human dignity coming from a shared history of democracy for over fifty years.
                    Clinton praised this unique German initiative to reach out to the victims of
                    this century's most horrible tragedy, and argued that it would convey
                    dramatically to the entire world Germany's commitment to justice and human
                    rights. Clinton stated that the German initiative would allow the United States
                    and Germany to enter the new millennium together determined to protect the
                    inviolability of human dignity. Germany embodied its commitment to human dignity
                    in the first article of the constitution for the Federal Republic of Germany
                    founded in 1949. Chancellor Schr�der, when he replied to President Clinton on
                    December 14, 1999, said that “[m]ore than anything else, the understanding
                    reached on the Federal Foundation is a significant humane gesture of our
                    responsibility toward Nazi victims at the close of this century.”</p>
                <pb facs="0223" n="Page0223"/>
                <p>The negotiations opened new avenues for communication and mutual understanding
                    among the many involved governments, businesses and interest groups. The U.S.
                    took on a facilitation role that followed an American tradition of mediation of
                    disputes between governments. This role is as old as Theodore Roosevelt's
                    success in ending the Russo-Japanese War in 1905 [when the Russian Foreign
                    Minister was Vladimir Lambsdorff, a distant relative of the German negotiator
                    Graf Lambsdorff]. However, U.S. involvement in private lawsuits, such as those
                    brought by former forced and slave laborers against Nazi industry, was
                    unprecedented and required a unique formulation.</p>
                <p>While the negotiations to establish the German Foundation focused on legal issues
                    for the companies and monetary compensation for victims, the preservation of
                    Germany and America's commitment to the inviolability of human dignity remained
                    the political underpinning of the talks; reconciliation was an important
                    goal.</p>
                <p>EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF NEGOTIATIONS</p>
                <p>Dr. Otto Graf Lambsdorff, Special Representative of the Chancellor, and Stuart E.
                    Eizenstat, U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary, ably led the negotiations. Both sides
                    sought dignified payments for survivors and negotiated U.S. help to achieve the
                    dismissal of the lawsuits against German business. Victims' groups were well
                    represented by U.S. plaintiffs' attorneys, their governments and by foundations
                    and NGO's. For example, the Conference on Material Claims against Germany, the
                    World Jewish Restitution Organization and the American Gathering of Holocaust
                    Survivors and the Israeli Survivors Organization represented Jewish victims with
                    the representatives of the State of Israel. Reconciliation efforts on behalf of
                    the perpetrators fell to German President Rau, who recognized the suffering of
                    forced laborers, which was necessary for reconciliation.</p>
                <p>In the negotiation itself the U.S. negotiators faced competing agendas from the
                    participating parties. The large number of players made traditional diplomatic
                    negotiations between governments unworkable. In addition to the government of
                    Germany there were other players in the forced and slave labor negotiations: the
                    numerous companies that employed Nazi victims; international Jewish agencies
                    that had never stopped seeking justice; the governments of countries where most
                    of the unrecognized Nazi victims resided (Eastern Europe and Israel); five
                    non-governmental organizations from Eastern Europe dedicated to assisting
                    victims; and scores of plaintiffs lawyers. There also was the need to consult
                    closely with our own state and local governments; they sought to impose
                    sanctions on German companies or seek divestment by State treasurers of funds
                    invested in Germany. We wanted their actions to advance, not retard, our efforts
                    to reach agreement.</p>
                <pb facs="0224" n="Page0224"/>
                <p>For the forced labor negotiations - the centerpiece of our efforts - we assembled
                    an unusual interagency U.S. Government team of diplomats and lawyers from the
                    Departments of State, Treasury and Justice capable of negotiating,
                    simultaneously, with representatives of several foreign governments, hundreds of
                    European companies, and a score of American class action lawyers, Central and
                    Eastern European reconciliation foundations, a United Nations organization and
                    forced and slave labor survivor groups. We opened and maintained a regular
                    dialogue with Congress and with state-level agencies, such as treasurers,
                    comptroller's offices and pension funds that had a stake in the result. This was
                    a unique organizational and procedural approach to an extremely complex
                    international negotiation.</p>
                <p>U.S. negotiators were clear on the criticality of the issues that they faced.
                    They had identified the U.S. national interests at stake and chose a role,
                    however, as a facilitator of negotiations among victims groups, companies's
                    representatives, lawyers and government officials. Since standard diplomatic
                    practices alone, such as government-to-government talks, would not work, we
                    invented new ones to include businesses, lawyers, NGOs, State government
                    officials and foreign foundations. In addition to governments, we worked closely
                    with survivors in Poland and East Europe as well as the Jewish Claims Conference
                    and Holocaust survivor organizations from the United States and the State of
                    Israel. The creative process included a new role for plaintiffs' attorneys and
                    state regulators in diplomacy. It was the state regulators; for example, who
                    formed the International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims and in New
                    York created the Holocaust Claims Processing Office.</p>
                <p>Agreement was reached in December 1999 on the ten billion German Marks to
                    capitalize the new German Foundation and reconciliation was strengthened by
                    President Johannes Rau's eloquent apology to survivors. In March 2000 agreement
                    was reached on the allocation of the money to the partner organizations,
                    property issues and the Future Fund. However, before we could sign the U.S. -
                    German Executive Agreement in July 2000, issues of legal peace needed to be
                    decided.</p>
                <p>LEGAL PEACEThe challenge we faced was how to convert existing class action
                    lawsuits by former slave and forced laborers - which covered only a few thousand
                    plaintiffs and would have dragged on until most of those eligible for benefits
                    had passed away - into elements of a statement of interest in the U.S.-German
                    international negotiation that potentially could benefit over a million
                    surviving victims, and to complete the negotiations within the lifetimes of the
                    survivors. The tension between the class-action lawyers representing the victims
                    and the company representatives seeking legal peace often overshadowed their
                    common goal of reaching out to the victims.</p>
                <pb facs="0225" n="Page0225"/>
                <p>Nevertheless, all sides knew that the key to success and payments for the victims
                    was the resolution of the issue of “legal peace” - dismissal of the lawsuits
                    against companies. European - Swiss, German, Austrian and French - companies
                    wanted assurances that all litigation and other legal action against them would
                    cease and that they would never be sued again. The U.S. Government could not
                    make such absolute guarantees for two reasons. Our legal system does not work
                    that way. And the U.S. Government would not bar Holocaust survivors who were
                    U.S. citizens from having their cases heard in their own courts. However, we
                    were successful in negotiating an agreement that created a new ten billion
                    German Mark (five billion dollar) German Foundation to make payments to victims,
                    while committing the United States, in statements of interest in U.S. courts, to
                    recommend dismissal of all lawsuits arising out of the National Socialist era
                    and World War II against German firms that were pending in U.S. courts as well
                    as any new suits as being in our foreign policy interest.</p>
                <p>Here again these negotiations called for not just new techniques and formats for
                    managing a complex negotiation, but new approaches to the substance of the
                    negotiation as well. It was the request that the United States file “statements
                    of interest” recommending the dismissal of pending and future cases that
                    required a unique solution never before used. The U.S. agreed to submit, in each
                    case, a “Statement of Interest,” complete with an affidavit by the Secretary of
                    State citing the important foreign policy considerations that led us to the
                    conclusion that the German Foundation should be the exclusive remedy for these
                    wrongs and urging the courts to agree. After the agreement was signed the U.S.
                    Government filed statements of interest in numerous cases and based these
                    filings on U.S. foreign policy interests. After long deliberation, the Europeans
                    concluded such Statements gave them sufficient confidence the cases would be
                    dismissed for them to agree to our proposed settlement. The courts have
                    dismissed all cases.</p>
                <p>The eventual agreement was based on a number of disparate, but key elements: The
                    class-action lawsuits brought by American plaintiffs' attorneys on behalf of
                    victims using the 1789 Alien Torts Claims Act as a basis for suing.</p>
                <p>The “Foundation Initiative of German Enterprises,” which accepted historical
                    responsibility and in February 1999 proposed establishing a German Foundation to
                    make dignified payments to surviving forced laborers;Threats of financial
                    boycotts if the companies did not pay victims were leveled by the World Jewish
                    Congress and the U.S. State Treasurers as well as in public media campaigns
                    against German and Austrian companies.</p>
                <p>U.S. government agreement to assist in achieving legal peace for German companies
                    in the United States for crimes arising out of National Socialism and the Second
                    World War.German Chancellor Gerhard Schr�der who, in the midst of a severe
                    budget cutting exercise, pledge of full German government financial support for
                    the agreement; and German President Johannes Rau, whose poignant words of
                    apology to the victims in the presence of Holocaust survivors, were so healing
                    and so necessary.</p>
                <pb facs="0226" n="Page0226"/>
                <p>APOLOGY</p>
                <p>In the presence of Holocaust survivors, President Rau said:</p>
                <p>“It is now therefore even more important that all survivors receive, as soon as
                    possible, the humanitarian payment agreed today. I know that for many it is not
                    really the money that matters. What they want is for their suffering to be
                    recognized as suffering and for the injustice done to them to be named
                    injustice.</p>
                <p>I pay tribute to all those who were subjected to slave and forced labor under
                    German rule, and, in the name of the German people, beg forgiveness. We will not
                    forget their suffering.”</p>
                <p>The perpetrator can and should admit his wrongs and ask forgiveness, but only the
                    victim can complete the process. Only the victim can say, “I accept your
                    apology. I forgive you.” Obviously, this is the most difficult act of all. On
                    behalf of the victims Roman Kent spoke after President Rau to explain the pain
                    still suffered by the victims and called for the continued respect for the
                    memory of those who died. Only then when the victims can accept the apology is
                    the process complete.</p>
                <p>ACHIEVEMENTS REACHED</p>
                <p>After the U.S.-German Executive Agreement and the Joint Statement were signed on
                    July 17, 2000, and in order to release the ten billion German Marks (five
                    billion dollars) to surviving forced and slave laborers, the United States
                    Government engaged in intensive efforts to help secure legal peace for German
                    companies in the U.S. This included successful dismissal of some 65 lawsuits
                    against German companies by three U.S. Courts. During the months-long process
                    two courts dismissed the slave and forced labor lawsuits and the cases against
                    the insurance companies in the fall of 2000; however the banking cases'
                    dismissal was delayed as an unusual step was taken to seek a writ of mandamus to
                    relieve a federal judge of her decision-making authority. The Second Circuit
                    Court of Appeals considered the writ of mandamus request and ordered the
                    dismissal of the suits against German banks in May 2001.</p>
                <p>The dismissal of these final cases ended the delay and reaffirmed the power of
                    the executive branch to set foreign policy goals in international agreements;
                    such as in this case to reach Holocaust survivors and surviving forced laborers.
                    Following that court decision, the United States worked closely with Dr. Otto
                    Graf Lambsdorff to ensure that the Bundestag would vote that “adequate legal
                    peace had been achieved” for German companies in the U.S. On May 30, 2001 the
                    Bundestag passed that resolution. German companies then transferred their
                    contributions to the German Foundation, which has begun to make payments to
                    survivors.</p>
                <pb facs="0227" n="Page0227"/>
                <p>In its first year of operation, the Foundation Directors reported that nearly
                    800,000 survivors had received a total of nearly three billion German Marks.
                    Such a significant amount of money reaching individuals in such a short time is
                    a tribute to the close cooperation among the partner organizations, notably the
                    Foundation for Polish-German Reconciliation and the Conference on Jewish
                    Material Claims Against Germany.</p>
                <p>These positive results reflect the real work of the German Foundation, although
                    there was continued criticism of opponents who would note the outstanding issues
                    of possible additional interest earned during the fund raising, the ongoing,
                    unsettled negotiations on additional insurance claims process procedures, and
                    money management issues such as the dispute over Zloty exchange rate loss for
                    the Polish allocation. The German Foundation Directors have reported interest
                    earnings that will ensure all commitments to survivors are met. Negotiations are
                    underway between the Foundation and the International Commission for Holocaust
                    Era Insurance Claims (ICHEIC) to resolve the remaining insurance claims handling
                    procedures, including publication of policyholder names lists, audits and
                    administrative costs. The DM 550 million insurance allocation from the
                    Foundation will be made available for claims and humanitarian payments as soon
                    as agreement is reached.</p>
                <p>RELATED AGREEMENTS REACHED IN EUROPE</p>
                <p>The United States, the Federal Republic of Germany, Poland as well as other
                    Eastern European countries, and in other cases Austria, France and Switzerland,
                    have worked in close partnership to establish institutions through international
                    agreements that hold great promise, not only to do justice for past wrongs, but
                    also to advance the cause of justice in public policy into the future. These
                    institutions include the German Foundation “Remembrance, Responsibility and the
                    Future,” the Austrian Reconciliation Fund, the Austrian General Settlement Fund,
                    and the French Banks supplemental fund. Their establishment of these
                    institutions is tangible evidence of the internationalization of these issues,
                    and the promise that the work of justice and remembrance will continue.</p>
                <p>In addition, these new institutions will serve to support democracy and freedom
                    in the Central and Eastern European countries as well as to provide benefits to
                    nearly one million of their citizens. One of our most important achievements has
                    been to provide a measure of justice not only to Jewish victims of the Nazi era,
                    but belated recognition and payments to the hundreds of thousands of “double
                    victims” of two of the twentieth century's worst evils: Nazism and Communism.
                    Moreover, by bringing together Germany, Poland, Austria, France, the State of
                    Israel and others in the creation of these institutions, we created a new
                    dimension in international cooperation.</p>
                <pb facs="0228" n="Page0228"/>
                <p>These new institutions represent a fulfillment of the United States' postwar
                    effort to address the concerns of victims and the consequences of the Nazi era.
                    They will contribute substantially to U.S.-European efforts to create a stable
                    and humane international community based on democracy, rule of law, and respect
                    for human rights. This kind of international cooperation among the world's
                    strongest allies is crucial to the foreign policies of our countries and to the
                    promotion of peace and stability in Europe. The very complexity of the
                    negotiations - the number of issues and the number of players - became one of
                    its strengths.</p>
                <p>The forced labor U.S.-German Executive Agreement is widely accepted as fair, in
                    large part because so many had a real hand in its resolution. Through efforts by
                    U.S. state government officials, plaintiffs' attorneys, authors, publicists and
                    distinguished political leaders, as well as by leaders of German enterprises and
                    of the governments of Germany, Poland, Austria, France and others, long-delayed
                    justice is being brought to surviving forced and slave laborers, property is
                    being returned, and insurance policies are being paid.</p>
                <p>IMPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE NEGOTIATIONS</p>
                <p>The slave and forced labor agreements reached in 2000-2001 sought to address
                    injustices borne of hatred, racism, anti-Semitism, xenophobic nationalism and
                    other grievances that led to World War II. Through diplomacy and political
                    negotiations new legal tools were created and played a larger role in diplomacy.
                    Some of our novel solutions have subsequently sparked controversy. Writing in
                    “Foreign Affairs” magazine, Anne-Marie Slaughter and David Bosco assert, “U.S.
                    courts have become a venue of choice for such [Holocaust survivor] suits because
                    they offer plaintiffs the benefits of procedural mechanisms... not to mention
                    the prospect of unparalleled media coverage and U.S. Government involvement.”
                    The authors go on to name this “Plaintiffs' Diplomacy.” Indeed, they argue that
                    class-action suits against corporations for violations of international law are
                    likely to complicate diplomatic relations. It will also likely generate pressure
                    on governments from powerful corporations to stop the practice.</p>
                <p>Although two decades ago the concept of “Plaintiffs' Diplomacy” was unknown, it
                    has become a new legal theory thrust upon and to some extent accepted by U.S.
                    courts, and state legislatures. Relying to a large degree on the Alien Tort
                    Claims Statute of 1789, three categories of “Plaintiffs' Diplomacy” cases have
                    made their way to U.S. courts. The first category of plaintiffs' diplomacy suits
                    is those suits brought against individuals who have committed grave violations
                    against international law in the name of the government. The second were suits
                    brought against corporations that may have violated international law. Lastly,
                    the third category of suits is of those supported by Congress in an effort to
                    achieve justice for victims of terrorism and oppression and filed against
                    foreign governments.</p>
                <pb facs="0229" n="Page0229"/>
                <p>The use of the 1789 Alien Torts Claims Act to engage U.S. Courts in such
                    political settlements of moral questions arising from National Socialism and
                    World War II was a compelling reason for German industry to make its offer to
                    create a new German foundation to make payments to surviving forced laborers.
                    German industry sought “legal peace” for its companies in the United States for
                    acts arising from National Socialism and World War II. However, the legal peace
                    we achieved is likely to have little effect as a deterrent to new foreign
                    policies of ethnic cleansing, revived hatreds or new economic grievances that
                    lead to new injustice.</p>
                <p>Despite success in obtaining legal and compensatory resolutions, the
                    effectiveness and incentive(s) of utilizing the Alien Tort Statute in resolving
                    such suits are still undetermined. Essentially, successful plaintiff's diplomacy
                    suits have relied on governments to negotiate agreements, as was done in the
                    slave and forced labor cases. These governmental agreements, however, have only
                    yielded two outcomes: (1) monetary payments for victims and (2) legal peace for
                    companies. Neither of the two resolves the issues of reconciliation, nor is
                    broad enough to deter future xenophobia, nationalism or anti-Semitism.</p>
                <p>The danger is that the narrow scope of legal peace and monetary payments may even
                    facilitate political leaders' failure to recognize injustices, to develop ways
                    to remember transgressions or to apologize to surviving victims or their
                    descendants. Only continued research to determine a fact-based history, such as
                    the reports prepared by historical commissions, which are mandated to determine
                    the truth and to promote political dialog based on accurate histories can act as
                    a barrier to future injustice.</p>
                <p>HISTORICAL COMMISSIONS AND REMEMBRANCE</p>
                <p>Much has already been done over the past fifty years. German historians have
                    written world-renown histories on the Holocaust and the Third Reich. The new
                    German Foundation also seeks to remember the victims of National Socialism,
                    accepts German responsibility for the Holocaust, and provides “a measure of
                    justice” for survivors and heirs through modest but significant payments for
                    former slave and forced laborers.</p>
                <pb facs="0230" n="Page0230"/>
                <p>Both financial assistance and apology were essential in the German effort. One
                    without the other would have been insufficient. No one believed that several
                    thousand dollars could truly compensate former slave and forced laborers for
                    their suffering and loss, but all could agree that such payments added real
                    meaning to the apology. Moreover, these payments provide valuable assistance
                    especially for Eastern European survivors, all of whom are old and many of whom
                    are poor. But the inability of governments to provide full compensation for the
                    wrongs of the past - to do the impossible - need not prevent governments from
                    doing what is needed and possible. In fact, others are addressing this horrible
                    history of the Twentieth century as well. France has reported on the role of the
                    Vichy regime with great detail in the Matteoli Report. Also, the Austrian
                    historical commission's research is underway and is to be published in the fall
                    of 2002.</p>
                <p>In the broadest sense, governments that seek reconciliation have the obligation
                    to resolve conflicts and to restore amicable relationships that facilitate
                    acceptance of an undesirable event or the settlement of a quarrel. The ongoing
                    process of reconciliation - apology, compensation and remembrance - requires the
                    aggressor and victims to make a commitment to teaching the lessons of an
                    atrocity in order to prevent it from occurring again. The success of our effort
                    to achieve justice for slave and forced labor survivors will be determined by
                    the continued commitment of those countries to open their archives on their
                    World War II policies, to research the actions of governments during the war,
                    and to uncover the truth of injustices inflicted in the name of their people.
                    The international Community at the Washington Conference should be held to their
                    declaration about the opening of archives pertaining to the Holocaust. That
                    commitment was to full archival openness on the Holocaust so that the Holocaust
                    was neither to be forgotten nor distorted, and that healing is a solemn duty of
                    all who cherish freedom and human dignity. The Washington Declaration was
                    strengthened by the January 2000 Declaration of the Stockholm International
                    Forum on the Holocaust, which also pledged nations to strengthen international
                    efforts to promote education, remembrance and research about the Holocaust.
                    Forgetting would continue to be an injustice to the victims.</p>
                <p>We have finally found a process to open archives and remove the historical
                    obstacles standing in the way of understanding the past and of a future based on
                    respect for human dignity. Although attempts at reconciliation for Holocaust
                    injustices have enabled us to accomplish tremendous feats, there is still much
                    to be done. Over the longer term, it is our hope that young people in the U.S.
                    and other countries will benefit from education and remembrance of both the
                    Holocaust and other injustices. As such, they will be able to better understand
                    how and why these acts of inhumanity occurred, the scourge of prejudice, what
                    can happen when the rule of law breaks down as well as the importance of
                    promoting reconciliation among racial, religious, and ethnic groups so that the
                    persecution and violence that marred the twentieth century is not repeated.
                    Consequently, the international community's work of the Task Force for
                    International Cooperation on Holocaust Education, Remembrance and Research has
                    also begun to take steps to combat the attitudes that foster intolerance,
                    prejudice, and ethnic hatred, which will help to prevent future occurrences of
                    violence and genocide.</p>
                <pb facs="0231" n="Page0231"/>
                <p>The various historical commissions now engaged in researching and reporting on
                    this history need not only conclude their research and publish their reports;
                    they need to lead the debate and help shape their own domestic as well as their
                    foreign policy to understand the utter destruction these historical policies
                    created and the implications such policies have for the current realities.</p>
                <p>APOLOGY, RECONCILIATION, DETERRENCE</p>
                <p>The agenda is crowded with new initiatives to remember the horrors of Twentieth
                    Century Europe, to bring a measure of justice to surviving victims and to find
                    reconciliation among perpetrators and victims. The German Foundation's Future
                    Fund, endowed with DM 700 million, invests in the future by devoting resources
                    to prevention of future human transgressions. The German Future Fund will foster
                    projects among the peoples affected by these events that will continue to
                    preserve the memory of the victims of the Nazi terror. The Future Fund will also
                    work intensively for a more stable, peaceful and cooperative region. Through
                    Future Fund projects, the Trustees of the German Foundation are dedicated to
                    fighting the continuing evils of intolerance, hatred, xenophobic nationalism and
                    anti-Semitism that led to the Second World War.</p>
                <p>To their credit Austrian and French leaders did not allow the philosophical and
                    practical questions to prevent them from embarking on the long road to
                    reconciliation. France created the Foundation for the Memory of the Shoah;
                    Austria created the Reconciliation Fund and has made a provision for the
                    Salzburg Seminar to teach tolerance. Both of these new efforts will preserve the
                    victims' memory and fight against new hatreds. All three - apology, compensation
                    and remembrance - are essential to Holocaust reconciliation efforts, so should
                    it be for other tragedies. Nothing, even financial restraints, should prevent a
                    country from doing what is necessary or feasible to further reconciliation
                    efforts.</p>
                <p>Hopefully, there will never be another war with the destructive impact of the
                    Second World War, nor will nations wait so long to provide justice for the
                    victims of conflict. One lesson of the September Eleven terrorist attack on the
                    United States is that hatred still dominates the policies of aggrieved parties.
                    Hatred can take many forms and the risk of weapons of mass destruction falling
                    into terrorist hands demonstrates the danger we face. Understanding the lessons
                    of the Holocaust is an urgent task. Fighting against hatred and xenophobia today
                    and to preserve the hard-won peace after the Cold War is an important agenda for
                    political, business, civil, opinion and moral leaders.</p>
                <pb facs="0232" n="Page0232"/>
                <p>Donald Kagan in his book On the Origins of War and the Preservation of Peace (New
                    York, 1995) argues that modern states, especially those who triumphed in the
                    Cold War, have the greatest interest in preserving peace and are quite different
                    than ancient Greek or Roman cultures that “venerated the military virtues,
                    deprivation and subordination to authority.” He adds that barriers of conscience
                    that can be used to preserve peace now stand in the way of acquiring and
                    maintaining power. Consequently, a sustained effort to develop such barriers of
                    conscience is needed to prevent new hatreds from dominating domestic and foreign
                    policy again. The slave and forced labor executive agreements with the United
                    States will have limited deterrence effect unless these values are strengthened
                    by actions such as the Germans, French and Austrians have begun to defeat the
                    scourge of hatred.</p>
                <p>While the U.S. will continue to be a leader in what is necessarily an ongoing
                    effort, other nations are taking important and independent action. As long as
                    respect for human dignity will be the guiding principle for respect among
                    nations, as the American President and the German Chancellor agreed, we will
                    fulfill our pledge to give meaning to the words that echo our hope after the
                    Holocaust - “Never Again.”</p>

                <p>Ambassador J.D. Bindenagel</p>
                <p>As I reflect on my thirty-year career as an American diplomat, I am struck by the
                    historical and personal connections that flow through the Bindenagel family
                    story. Carl Bindernagel emigrated from Germany to escape the Franco-Prussian War
                    of 1870 and pioneered in Dakota Territory. His son Fred established the
                    Bindenagel American identity, which was forged by anti-German feelings during
                    the First World War, and struggled through the Great Depression in the Dust Bowl
                    of the Dakotas. His son Gordon, my father, was a member of the “Greatest
                    Generation” as described by South Dakotan Tom Brokow in his book of the same
                    title, returned to Germany as an American soldier to help liberate Europe from
                    National Socialism. While Germany was divided following the Second World War and
                    through the 1989 Democratic Revolution and after German unification, I served as
                    an American Army Officer and as an American diplomat in Germany. As Germany
                    struggled to establish democracy from Paul's Kirche in 1848 to the unification
                    of Germany in 1990, the history of the Bindenagel family has run parallel to the
                    history of six Germanys.</p>
                <p>A BEGINNING IN GERMANY</p>
                <pb facs="0234" n="Page0234"/>
                <p>As the cannons became silent and the smoke cleared from the battlefield at
                    K�niggr�tz, Bohemia (now the Czech Republic) on July 3, 1866 two historical
                    events had occurred. Politically, Prussian Prime Minister Otto von Bismarck had
                    defeated Austria in the “German War' and had prepared the ground for the
                    revolution of blood and iron. Personally, Pomeranian Musketeer Carl Friedrich
                    Bindernagel had survived one of the bloodiest battles of the nineteenth century
                    and was shortly to emigrate from Germany to America.</p>
                <p>Carl Bindernagel was born January 27, 1842, in Pommerania, a North German
                    Prussian principality. At the time there was no single German nation; the nation
                    had ceased to exist in 1806 when Emperor Franz II of the Holy Roman Empire of
                    the German Nation laid down his crown. A German Confederation was created after
                    the victory over Napoleon during the Congress of Vienna, September 1814 to June
                    1815. That confederation embodied the hopes of many Germans to create a nation,
                    but the confederation, which replaced the old “Reich,” failed in its attempt to
                    establish democracy and became a loose association of individual principalities
                    and states.</p>
                <p>The governing body of the confederation was the Bundestag, which was able to act
                    only if Austria and Prussia agreed. Modern economic development began in Prussia
                    at this time, especially heavy industry and machine manufacture. In another
                    revolutionary attempt to establish democracy in1848, a National Assembly meeting
                    in St. Pau1's Cathedral in Frankfurt made when Carl Bindernagel was just 6 years
                    old. Although the National Assembly established a new order, elected an Austrian
                    as Imperial Administrator, drafted a constitution, and offered Prussian King
                    Friedrich Wilhelm IV the hereditary German imperial crown, the king refused the
                    offer of being named “Kaiser” to avoid being responsible to the revolutionaries
                    in Frankfurt. In May 1849 a popular uprising to enforce the constitution failed
                    and in 1850 the confederation was abandoned.</p>
                <p>Economic development in Prussia also came with attempts to bring constitutional
                    reform to government by making the king and his Prime Minister Otto von Bismarck
                    follow the wishes of the parliament. The Prussian parliament wanted to change
                    the structure of the army. Bismarck ignored the parliament and engaged in war to
                    silence them.</p>
                <p>Carl Bindernagel, at age 22, was conscripted as a soldier in Otto von Bismarck's
                    war against the Danes. This German-Danish War (1864) gained for Prussia and its
                    ally Austria the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein, which are still parts of
                    Germany. Bismarck, recognizing that Austria with its Hungarian Empire would not
                    join a German nation, had sought to divide Germany between the Austrians in the
                    South and the Prussians in the North. As the two allies fought the Danes,
                    Bismarck moved toward conflict with Austria.</p>
                <pb facs="0235" n="Page0235"/>
                <p>Carl, then 24 and a musketeer in the 5th Pomeranian Infantry Regiment, joined in
                    the decisive battle at K�niggr�tz. It was a short war. On June 21, 1866, the
                    Prussian troops crossed the Bohemian border commanded by the Chief of the
                    General Staff, Helmut von Moltke. Three Army groups marched into the
                    Schlachtfeld (field of slaughter) near Koeniggraetz. The Prussian soldiers were
                    well trained and well led. They were outfitted with a new rifle
                    (Z�ndnadelgewehr) capable of seven shots per minute. Their Austrian opponents'
                    rifles were capable of only two shots per minute.</p>
                <p>General von Moltke used railroads to bring his 220,000 troops to battle and
                    coordinated movements with the telegraph. The 215,000 Austrians were less well
                    prepared and were quickly surrounded. The result was horrendous. Austria lost
                    33,000 soldiers, while Prussia lost only 9,000. It was one of the worst European
                    slaughters of the 19th century. It did past the test for battle horror of the
                    Civil War battle where at Gettysburg where some 50,000 were lost.</p>
                <p>Germany also lost along with this battle the hope for constitutional democracy.
                    Otto von Bismarck had defeated the parliament and imposed his will on the
                    future, a triumph for an absolutist leader. Democracy in Germany would have to
                    wait.</p>
                <p>Carl Bindernagel was awarded a medal for his role as a rifleman in the battle of
                    K�niggr�tz. A certificate, photocopied for me by Aunt Mildred Maloney, has the
                    following citation (translated from the German):WITH GOD, FOR THE KING AND THE
                    FATHERLANDON THE ORDER OF HIS MAJESTY OF KINGSIS THAT FROM HIS HIGHEST

                <p>Eberhard Kohler, who 1ived in Bochum, Germany and corresponded with my
                    grandmother Elsie Bindenagel, wrote that after Carl had survived the
                    German-Danish War and the German-Austrian War, he feared yet another war would
                    break out and would likely cost him his life. Indeed, Otto von Bismarck launched
                    the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 and proved Musketeer Carl's fear was not
                    unfounded. Carl emigrated from Germany to America between 1867 and 1870.</p>
                <p>THE FAMILY TREE AND EMIGRATION IN THE LATE 1800s</p>
                <p>Emigration in the late 19th Century meant an almost total break with one's
                    family. War, hard economic times and the promise of a brighter future in America
                    combined in Carl to help him make that break. He left behind a family history
                    stretches back hundreds of years.</p>
                <pb facs="0236" n="Page0236"/>
                <p>The earliest record I found of the Bindernagel family history in Germany was from
                    the 1600's in Sachsen-Gotha, near Kassel. This group of Bindernagels reached
                    back from Friedberg (near Frankfurt am Main) where the Bindernagel Buchhandlung
                    bookstore has had a publishing company for over 150 years. One earlier
                    descendent was the mayor of Friedberg and designed the town garden. Friedberg is
                    a delightful small city.</p>
                <p>The family bookstore was the center of hectic Christmas shopping in 1984, when
                    the Frankfurt Allgemeine newspaper described its great offerings of books. I
                    discovered the store from that FAZ article and visited the Bindernagel
                    Buchhandlung. The current owner's grandmother was the last Bindernagel and his
                    elderly father still had his family tree and shared the following lineage with
                    me in 1985.</p>
                <p>The Friedberg branch of the family tree (Ahnentafel) began with Hans Bindernagel
                    who was born in 1624 in the town of Woelfis in the Grand Duchy of Sachsen-Gotha.
                    Hans died in 1656. Johannes Bindernagel, who was born in 1697 and lived in
                    Kassel, followed him. Johannes was a Kaufmann, a businessman. He died in 1718.
                    Next to come was Johannes Heinrich Bindernagel who was also born in Woelfis in
                    1719. He died in 1777 in Kassel. He was followed by Johannes Lorenz Bindernagel,
                    who was born in 1750 in Kassel and was a taxman (Steuerschreiber), by
                    profession. He died in Rothheim in 1799. In the 1780s there was a Carl Jakob
                    Bindernagel on one of the side branches of the tree. I was very surprised since
                    our son has the same name! The name Heinrich appears again in Heinrich Carl
                    Bindernagel, who was born in 1775 in Kassel and died in the 1800s in
                    Friedberg.</p>
                <p>Other branches of the family can be found in Gelsenkirchen, in Munich, and in
                    Hamburg. Lutz Bindernagel is a journalist for the Hamburg-based German magazine
                    Stern. In Berlin in the 1920' and 1930's there was a well-known Opera singer,
                    Gertrude Bindernagel, who was from the family. In Halle or Dresden and other
                    cities in the former German Democratic Republic there may be other Germans with
                    the Bindernagel name. When we lived in Bremen (1977-1979) we met Juergen and
                    Brunhild Bindernagel, a veterinarian who had emigrated from Halle, East Germany,
                    with his parents. The name itself, according to Juergen Bindernagel, is derived
                    from the 'binding nails' or large wooden pegs used to connect the support beams
                    of thatched-roof houses prevalent in Pommerania. The makers of these nails were
                    probably called Bindernagelmacher.</p>
                <pb facs="0237" n="Page0237"/>
                <p>The “r” in the name was lost sometime between the departure from Germany and the
                    recording of the name of the first settlers in the United States. I suspect a
                    recording clerk, not hearing the almost silent “r,” simply left it out when
                    inscribing the name on a birth or citizenship paper. Another variation on the
                    name came to us when my wife Jean and I lived in Korea from 1975 to 1977. A
                    friend translated the name to Chinese, giving it four Chinese characters -
                    Important people, Abundance, Appears, and Excellence. The Bindenagel name
                    translation from Chinese reads: “A distinguished gentleman who appears from the
                    crowd.” That saying is more of a standard for us to live by than a comment on
                    where we have come.</p>
                <p>Of our branch in Germany, we know that Carl came from Pomerania, which includes
                    the Island of R�gen. My grandmother, Elsie Bindenagel, wrote regularly to the
                    Grandson of Christoph Bindernagel, Eberhard Koehler. Christoph, was a shoemaker
                    in Putbus, R�gen. He kept his own store and died in 1940. During the Third Reich
                    some of these Bindernagels joined the National Socialists' Nazi party, but none
                    rose to positions of prominence.</p>
                <p>The Island of R�gen is a rural, farming area on the Baltic Sea. The Lietzow Bay
                    is renown for its sailing and the white chalk cliffs of Sassnitz that rival the
                    white, cliffs of Dover. It is an East German resort today. The family farm on
                    R�gen, according to family legend, was the Bauernhof “Tilzow” and was located
                    between Putbus and the capital, Bergen. Koehler's Uncle Otto Bindernagel lived
                    on Ruegen and after World War II was a guide who wore a marine cap. He retired
                    in 1962 and died in 1963. He was buried with “every possible pomp and honor,”
                    according to Koehler, who attended the funeral. With him died the last direct
                    descendent of that branch of our family in Germany with the name the name
                    Bindernagel.</p>
                <p>The American branch of he Bindernagel, without the 'r,' family began with Carl's
                    decision to emigrate to America. Carl's brother Christoph Bindernagel, according
                    to Christoph was Koehler's Great Uncle. Koehler wrote to my grandmother that
                    Carl emigrated after he was awarded his medal for the battle of K�niggr�tz in
                    1867. The Koehler family in Germany remembered Malte Carl's emigration as a
                    resu1t of war and his decision not to experience (erleben) another war.</p>
                <p>Other Bindernagels who are recorded in immigration records included Gottlieb
                    Bindernagel in Philadelphia in 1873 and Amalie Bindernagel in New York in
                    1883.</p>
                <p>Carl's emigration probably began with a train ride to Hamburg or Bremen, the main
                    ports of departure for the United States. Once in Bremerhaven he had to buy a
                    ticket for the voyage on either a sailing ship, which took seven weeks, or on
                    one of the new steamers introduced in 1857. The North German Lloyd was a large
                    Bremen shipping company, which was one of the most renowned shippers. Lloyd
                    operated out of the New Port of Bremen at Bremerhaven and by the 1870s had run
                    the sailing ships out of the emigration business with its steamships.</p>
                <pb facs="0238" n="Page0238"/>
                <p>The city of Bremen, in order to win the emigration business, set standards for
                    food, space and health for the trip to America. The trip could be frightening
                    with North Sea storms and seasickness. After his arrival in New York, he
                    probably traveled by train to Illinois.</p>
                <p>LIFE IN ILLINOIS IN THE 1870-1880s</p>
                <p>Carl came to Ford county Illinois in the 1870s where he was a tenant farmer on
                    the Illinois great farm, “Burr Oaks.” The farm was located in Ford and
                    Livingston counties, embraced exactly sixty-five square miles, over 40,000
                    acres. M.L. Sullivant purchased it at an average price of $1.25 per acre.
                    Harper's Weekly Supplement of September 23, 1871 described the Burr Oaks
                    farm.</p>
                <p>“The land which is rolling, in some places quite broken, is in the form of a
                    square, and has been crossed by wide avenues hedged on either side with the
                    Osage orange. Three hundred miles of hedge have been set out, six miles of
                    ditching (the ditches are seven feet wide and near1y two feet in depth) have
                    been done to drain the wet places; numerous corn cribs, farm buildings, shops
                    for various work; ad a vast amount of work of all descriptions in which a new
                    place abound. He [Sullivant] believes persistent labor, directed by fair
                    judgment, will enable any man to follow Horace Greeley's advice - i.e., move
                    West and prosper.”</p>
                <p>The regular work of the Burr Oak farm, a corn farm, was breaking virgin prairie,
                    planting, cultivating and harvesting. Oxen were used to break the land with a
                    “breaking-plow” cutting a furrow twenty inches in width turning the sod
                    two-three inches deep. This is done in the early spring, summer and the fall. If
                    done before June 20, corn could be planted and harvested with a yield of twenty
                    bushels to the acre. That paid the interest on the land at Illinois Central
                    Railroad prices as well as the expenses incurred in the work, and even a
                    profit.</p>
                <p>A man and a team of oxen could plant twelve and one-half acres. A heavier crop
                    was planted on land when the breaking-plow was followed by a stirring-plow and a
                    furrow cut four inches with the earth thrown back over the sod plowing. This was
                    done in the summer or fall. In the spring this land is harrowed, planted and
                    cultivated in the same manner as old land. Old ground was plowed from the first
                    of April to the 10th of June. With a steel plow and horses or mules, two and one
                    quarter acres could be done in a day.</p>
                <p>A man with four yoke of oxen would harrow, with gang harrows, from twenty-five to
                    thirty acres a day. The cultivation was done by machinery and repeated three or
                    four times depending on the condition of the ground. Scattered about were boys
                    with low trucks or wagons with casks of drinking water for the workers.</p>
                <pb facs="0239" n="Page0239"/>
                <p>When the cultivation was finished, the workers returned to breaking ditches and
                    other farm work until harvest. At harvest, the men were organized into squads
                    with a boss, two wagons and four horses. Each squad had two to six gangs. Each
                    gang took five rows of corn and an average of fifty bushels of corn was cribbed
                    for every man's day's work. The cribs, long wooden sheds 64 feet X 12 feet high,
                    were set at convenient points and could hold three thousand bushel each. When
                    grain was shipped east, power Sheller was set to work between cribs. Trains were
                    contracted through to New York to avoid paying two or three commissions as well
                    as elevator risks and charges.</p>
                <p>Burr Oaks was a temperance farm. Whiskey was used only for snakebites even though
                    Mr. Sullivant was “doubtful whether the whiskey [would] not injure the man more
                    than the snakebite.” There was also fun to be had. Sundays at the close of the
                    day the hands from different farms assembled at the dance hall in the Burr Oaks
                    grove for which the farm was named. Fiddlers and accordion players furnished
                    music. Harper's Weekly reported that the Swedish girls of Burr Oaks were dancers
                    of “no mean rank,” if endurance were taken into consideration. Burr Oaks was
                    reputedly a temperance place fighting drunkenness, and other nuisances were
                    seldom occurrences.</p>
                <p>It was here that Carl found his first home in America. In the Lyman county
                    agricultural production report from June 1880, Carl was listed as a tenant
                    farmer. He farmed 70 acres of corn, had an additional 15 acres of permanent
                    meadows, pastures or orchard and had 10 acres of unimproved land (old fields).
                    On the land he produced 1400 bushels of Indian corn on 40 acres, 190 bushels of
                    oats on 10 acres, 70 bushels of seed flax and 4 tons of straw on 10 acres, 30
                    bushels of potatoes on 2 acres, and had one acre planted with apples. He also
                    had two cows, one of which had a calf. He sold one cow and made 200 pounds of
                    butter in 1879. He had two pigs and 40 chickens in June of 1879. The value of
                    the farm in 1880 was listed as $2500.00 with $50 in farm implements and
                    machinery and $200 worth of livestock. His crop for the year 1879, when his son
                    Fred was born was valued at $500.00. Additionally he had 10 acres of hay and
                    three horses.</p>
                <p>His bride-to-be was a daughter of another tenant farmer. There were several
                    Siebrecht [Sebright] names registered in 1880. Charles had 75 acres, Thomas 125
                    acres, and Ferdanand 70. Carl married Carolina Siebrecht in Paxton, Illinois in
                    1875. Carl and Carolina had children born in Illinois.</p>
                <p>DAKOTA TERRITORY -THE MIDDLE BORDER</p>
                <pb facs="0240" n="Page0240"/>
                <p>Large areas in the Dakota Territory were and remain Indian country. Today there
                    are 9 Indian Reservations - the Pine Ridge, Rosebud, Cheyenne, Standing Rock,
                    Crow Creek, Lower Brule, Yankton, Sisseton and Flandreau. Several tribes
                    preceded these new European immigrant farmers in the life of the territory. The
                    first known were the Mound Builders, who at one time lived in the Ohio Valley
                    and buried their dead in mounds near Sioux Falls. A second tribe was the
                    Arikara, or Ree, Indians, who migrated from Yankton. They built large villages,
                    grew gardens of beans, corn squash and tobacco to supplement their diet of
                    buffalo. They lived there peacefully until 1750 when the invading Teton Sioux
                    drove them up the Missouri River valley. After forty years of war with the
                    Sioux, the Rees were virtually extinct.</p>
                <p>The Sioux, or Dakota, Indians were forced out of Wisconsin and Minnesota by the
                    more numerous Ojibways who had also been given firearms by the French. The Sioux
                    migrated west, fought the Rees to extinction, and conquered the land West to the
                    Black Hills. In the 1770s a few white trappers and fur traders encountered the
                    Sioux and established trading posts to trade with the Sioux. Trade flourished
                    with the coming of the Steamboat on the Mississippi.</p>
                <p>The Sioux, who were friendly with the British and with whom they had long trading
                    relations, joined forces on the British side in the War of 1812. The British
                    ended the war with the Treaty of Ghent in 1814 and left the Sioux to make their
                    own peace with the Americans. A treaty of peace was signed July 15, 1815 with
                    the Sioux tribes.</p>
                <p>By 1862 the tribes in Minnesota engaged the white settlers in a desperate war.
                    The U.S. Army drove these Indian tribes across the border, broke up their
                    villages or herded them into camps - Fort Randall, Fort Lookout, Fort Thompson,
                    Fort George, Fort Pierre, Fort Sully, and Fort Bennett. One, Fort Sisseton, has
                    been restored. Most of the dramatic events in Indian warfare of the last century
                    occurred after the Sioux signed the 1867 treaty and agreed to move to
                    reservations before 1876.</p>
                <p>DAKOTA TERRITORY BINDENAGEL HOMESTEAD</p>
                <p>With the peace fixed in the West and the Indians moving to the reservations, Carl
                    turned his attention to a new homestead West of Illinois. Free land was a
                    powerful force bringing settlers West. And for Carl, tenant farmer in Illinois,
                    the 1862 Homestead Law, which was signed by President Lincoln, opened a new life
                    for the Bindenagel family in the West.</p>
                <p>Malte and his wife Carolina came to Ashton, Dakota Territory in March 1882 from
                    Roberts, in Ford County, Illinois. They filed their homestead claim in Harmony
                    Township, seven miles North East of Frankfurt, which was founded a year later in
                    1883. There they farmed for twenty years. In 1902 they retired and moved to
                    Frankfurt. Carl died October 20, 1916 in Frankfurt. Carolina lived with their
                    son, Fred, until she died in Huron, South Dakota on November 8, 1932.</p>
                <pb facs="0241" n="Page0241"/>
                <p>Fred married Elsie Vollmer, a 1911 music graduate of Dakota Wesleyan University,
                    on December 10, 1910 in Redfield. Irving Klaus, the local minister stood up for
                    Fred and Fred's sister Emma stood up for Elsie. Reverend Hoffman, whom Fred had
                    met while at Charles City Iowa Business College, presided. Fred was not called
                    for service in the Great War, which America joined in 1917. My grandmother told
                    me how the family ceased to identify with their German heritage during the war,
                    but shared with me the family bible, in Gothic German, which had accompanied the
                    pioneers on the prairie for a generation. Birth and marriage certificates of the
                    immigrants were still published in German until the First World War.</p>
                <p>My father, Gordon, was born August 31, 1920 in Frankfurt, South Dakota, and moved
                    to Huron in 1926 when Fred moved from Frankfurt. Fred left the farm to become a
                    businessman, baker, undertaker and retail merchant in that small town on the
                    prairie.</p>
                <p>The annals of Huron began with the 1879 claim staked out by John Cain on the
                    Eastern Shore of the James River. Shortly afterwards, a surveying party for the
                    Chicago and Northwestern Railroad camped on the West bank of the James River and
                    Marvin Hughitt, the general manager of the line, chose to make the site his
                    division Headquarters. Marvin and his fellows in Chicago named Huron after the
                    Indian tribe and the Great Lake Huron.</p>
                <p>Huron became a bustling boomtown. Buildings shot up to meet the needs of the
                    settlers who kept pouring in to the area. The War Department established a
                    signal station, now the weather bureau. Stores were established. The pioneer
                    druggist Hollard Wheeler built a brick building for his pharmacy. In 1885 a
                    brick building did not a town make! However, on Dakota Avenue Wheeler had the
                    hay cut at “haying time” in front of his store, of course, to improve
                    appearances on the otherwise muddy street.</p>
                <p>In the late eighteen eighties, crop failures and a severe recession checked the
                    growth of Huron. In a comeback in 1904 Huron was selected as the site for the
                    State Fair. After World War I, several headquarters were set up for oil, utility
                    and wholesale companies. Fortunes changed again from 1933-35 when drought and
                    dust storms ravaged the crops and crippled the economy. One contemporary
                    observer noted that Huron was harder hit than any other area in the eastern part
                    of the State. As a result many soil conservation projects were launched and the
                    government planted a “shelter belt” of trees. However, not until 1937 did the
                    lakes and rivers fill up with water again.</p>
                <p>The dust storms were bad. In 1933 when Grandpa Fred's Uncle George Laxton died,
                    my Uncle Wilbur drove to the funeral. On his way the dirt was so thick that he
                    crashed into the ditch. The funeral had to be postponed. When Wilbur and the
                    group finally arrived, they were black with dust. When they returned, a store
                    window at Fred's grocery store, “Bindy's Market,” had been blown out. A scoop
                    shovel was needed to sweep up the dirt. Even by then the river had dried up and
                    water from Lampe's artesian well behind the store was virtually the only thing
                    that kept anyone from thirst. And this was just the first of the many dust
                    storms that followed.</p>
                <pb facs="0242" n="Page0242"/>
                <p>Fred had moved into Huron in 1926 and ran the Hopkins bakery for his first year
                    in town. The market was on the site of the future Huron Theater. Fred then
                    bought the City Meat Market, an old store with a stoop for the “old-timers” to
                    sit and pass the time. Out the back door and across the alley was Robinson's
                    Shoe store, where Dad sampled a pint of booze once, compliments of
                    Robinson's.</p>
                <p>After Fred sold City Meat Market, he opened “Bindy's Market” at 256 Wisconsin
                    Avenue. He shared the building with the Farmers' Union Cream Station. The
                    location was ideal. The farmers brought in eggs to Grandpa's store. While Uncle
                    Bill candled the eggs for freshness, the farmers took their cream to the
                    creamery. Grandpa Fred of course, cashed the cream checks and won over many
                    customers. On Saturdays, Dad ground coffee in that gigantic coffee grinder with
                    two huge wheels and a small drawer for the grounds.</p>
                <p>Life in Huron was not always harsh and dull. In the 1930s the John Dillinger gang
                    robbed he National Bank of South Dakota at Third Street and Wisconsin Avenue. On
                    that day my grandfather's brother Art, who was my high school teacher Dana
                    Harlow's pet, was in Bindy's market. Dr. Buchanan's office was located upstairs
                    along with several apartments. Well, as John Dillinger drove out of town after
                    robbing the bank, he fired into Bindy's market and Uncle Art ducked behind the
                    counter as the shots ricocheted upstairs.</p>
                <p>Now John Dillinger was cold-blooded thug who had shot and killed 10 men during
                    his life of crime. Many Americans who had lost all they had in the Great
                    Depression, had also lost some sense of their strong pioneer values. Many were
                    not only impoverished; they were also embittered. Out of desperation some of
                    them found a skewed sense of justice in bank robbery (in general - not in
                    Huron). John Dillinger became a kind of Robin Hood folk hero by robbing banks.
                    He seemed to them to be robbing from those who had become rich by robbing the
                    poor folks like them.</p>
                <p>The wanted poster from the era proclaimed John Dillinger an outlaw, a fugitive
                    from justice and a vicious menace to life and property. Governors of Indiana,
                    Ohio, Minnesota, Michigan, and Illinois offered a $5,000 reward for Dillinger -
                    Dead or Alive. In the end John Dillinger proved to be no match for J. Edgar
                    Hoover's FBI, after a brothel keeper betrayed him. Public Enemy No.1 Dillinger
                    was confronted and gunned down in front of a Chicago movie theater in July 1934
                    by a police strike force led by G-man Melvin Purvis.</p>
                <p>As these events were unfolding another prominent American moved to Huron. In 1931
                    the Doland, South Dakota, druggist moved to town and opened Humphrey's Drug
                    Store, one of the first Walgreen agency drug stores. Hubert Humphrey's father
                    called Hubert back from his studies at the University of Minnesota to help run
                    the store in Huron. Hubert the next year was able to go to Denver for an
                    intensive pharmacist's course at Capitol College of Pharmacy.</p>
                <pb facs="0243" n="Page0243"/>
                <p>Back in Huron just as the Depression and the dust storms hit, Hubert learned
                    lessons many Americans were learning. Times were hard and it was not the
                    traditional poor who were rebelling. Those who had once had done well, now had
                    lost much of their possessions, including their farms, and were angry. Hubert
                    described in his autobiography how irate farmers marched down Dakota Avenue to
                    hold a rally in Campbell Park. Although Humphrey's Drug store, like many other
                    businesses, was on the verge of bankruptcy, those farmers looked on the
                    Humphrey's as having survived at their expense. There was real concern that had
                    the marchers become violent; the farmers would have probably turned on those who
                    kept body and soul together in the bad times.</p>
                <p>For Hubert the Works Progress Administration (WPA) demonstrated how interrelated
                    the people and political issues really are, how mutually dependent they are, and
                    how government programs never have simple, isolated effects.</p>
                <p>Hubert's political fortunes are well known: Senator from Minnesota, Vice
                    President, and Democratic Presidential Candidate. His devotion to others also
                    left a mark on the Bindenagels. Hubert worked hard at the drug store and took
                    off only for three reasons. On Wednesdays he tried to take his future wife
                    dancing; he frequently took off to work for the Beadle County Young Democrats,
                    and on Mondays he devoted time to the Methodist Church Boy Scout Troop 6. As
                    scoutmaster he left a mark on my family. When my dad, Gordon, was 12 or 13 years
                    old, Hubert was his scoutmaster. In addition to Hubert's nickname of “Pinky” for
                    his liberal political views. One unfinished story stands out with Dewey van
                    Dyke, superintendent of Mails, and Hubert as scoutmasters who tried to raise a
                    flagpole at scout camp and caused a scandal. (We are looking for the photo of
                    this event and the rest of the tale.)</p>
                <p>When my father was 22 and a college student at Huron College, where his brothers
                    Donald and Wilbur as well as his sister Mildred attended, decided to go off on
                    his own to seek his fortune. After a short time in Long Beach, California, he
                    married my mother Patricia Williams, who followed him from Huron and then was
                    drafted into the U.S. Army.</p>
                <p>The young private Bindenagel was assigned to the 104th Infantry Division - the
                    Timberwolf Division - and arrived in Cherbourg, France with the U.S. invasion
                    under the command of General Terry Allen. After fighting their way through
                    Belgium, the 104th charged through Cologne and crossed the Rhine near the
                    Remagen bridgehead at K�nigswinter, where the post-war U.S. Embassy to West
                    Germany would be built and I would live for six years.</p>
                <p>My father's 414th Infantry Regiment protected the 3d Armored Division in
                    conquering the Ruhr pocket with its 335,000 encircled German Wehrmacht troops.
                    His regiment defeated them at Paderborn on April 1, 1945. For their vital role
                    in the Ruhr the Division Commander recommended his unit for a citation that
                    reads in part:</p>
                <pb facs="0244" n="Page0244"/>
                <p>“The 414th Infantry Regiment is cited for outstanding performance of duties in
                    action against the enemy during the period 25 March 1945 to 1 April 1945, in
                    which extraordinary heroism, determination, and brilliant team action of its
                    individual members contributed greatly to the closing of the Ruhr pocket during
                    the historic drive of the First United States Army from the Rhine to the Elbe
                    River in Germany. During this eight-day period the 414th Regiment ...slashed
                    through enemy defense for more than 200 miles, moving form one center of
                    resistance to another atop tanks. The regiment started the drive in a daring
                    night attack resulting in the taking of the remaining high ground east of the
                    Remagen bridgehead, and the securing of the bridgehead over the Weide River. In
                    a series of hazardous and difficult attacks, one enemy stronghold after another
                    fell to the courageous men of the regiment. ...After hard bitter fighting the
                    objectives of Altenkirken and Marburg fell, and on 31 March 1945, the regiment
                    was in front of the key city of Paderborn. This was an SS school, heavily
                    defended by SS troops. Although greatly outnumbered the weary but aggressive
                    troops ... once again attacked and on 1 April 1945 Paderborn fell, contact was
                    made with units of the Ninth United States Army, and thus the pocket was closed.
                    ....The gallantry, devotion and esprit de corps of the officers and men of the
                    414th Infantry Regiment reflect the highest credit upon themselves and the
                    military service of the United States.”</p>
                <p>The unit went on to Nordhausen where a huge underground V-bomb factory was
                    discovered and had had some 25,000 slave laborers, who had toiled for months in
                    to produce V-1 and V-2 rockets. The unit also liberated the concentration camp
                    at Nordhausen, a camp for political prisoners, with unspeakable horrors of death
                    among the prisoners. Reports from the medics who sought to save some survivors
                    and to bury the dead read today of man's most inhuman possibilities. Truly in
                    the words of a German proverb: “In time of war the Devil makes more room in
                    hell.” My father never spoke of the concentration camps, but in the spring of
                    2001 as U.S. Special Envoy for Holocaust Issues in the U.S. State Department, I
                    attended a memorial service in the Capitol Rotunda. As we waited for President
                    George Bush to arrive the colors of the units that had liberated the
                    concentration camps entered the hall. As I saw the gray Timberwolf Division
                    flag, I could see the soldiers of my father's unit entering the death camps and
                    was shaken myself. So powerful was the image and so thankful and proud I was
                    that my father had fought to end the National Socialist regime. My father was
                    awarded the Bronze Star for his service.</p>
                <p>Back in Huron after the Second World War, my father rejoined the Methodist church
                    choir with his father. The Methodist Church played a significant role in our
                    lives, especially the choir directed by Mrs. Byrne Griffith and accompanied by
                    Harriet Ray on the organ. Fred, Gordon and Gordon's kids all sang in the
                    Methodist Choir. At Easter we sang the “Seven Last Words,” and at Christmas we
                    sang Hugo Distler's “The Christmas Story” and the Hallelujah Chorus by Georg
                    Handel. The music at the church was wonderfully inspiring for the community.</p>

                <p>The Bindenagel's of Huron have scattered over the years. Mildred married Giles
                    Maloney of Madison and pursued a career with her husband in the FBI. Wilbur
                    became an economist and worked for Cargill Grain, including several years in
                    Switzerland. He died of cancer in 1977. Donald and his wife Mary lived many
                    years in Tucson, Arizona, where they retired. They have two children, Dean and
                    Barbara. Gordon returned to Huron after World War II, raised his family of six
                    children, before moving to Rockford, Illinois in 1965. He and his wife Patricia
                    (Williams) are both retired.</p>
                <p>Gordon's family settled in Rockford in the 1960s, except for J.D. Bindenagel, who
                    graduated from the University of Illinois with a BA in political science and an
                    M.A. in public administration. He went on to serve in the U.S. Army Third
                    Infantry Division in W�rzburg, Germany and in the U.S. Foreign Service in Seoul,
                    Korea as well as Bremen, Bonn, and Berlin. After serving as acting U.S.
                    Ambassador in Germany, 1996-1997, he was named Ambassador and U.S. Special Envoy
                    for Holocaust Issues. He retired from the U.S. Foreign Service in 2003 and
                    became vice president of the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations. He and his
                    wife, Jean (Lundfelt) Bindenagel have two children, Annamarie and Carl to
                    continue the story.</p>
