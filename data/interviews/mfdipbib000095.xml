                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Thomas Dunnigan speaking on August 25, 1999.
                        Today, I will be talking with Melville Blake, a retired Foreign Service
                        officer, who spent more than 35 years in the field of foreign affairs. Mel,
                        why don't we begin with you telling us something about your background,
                        education, and service in the military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: I was born in Lexington, Mississippi, June 29, 1924. My family actually
                    lived on Mileston Plantation just north of Yazoo City. Daddy was manager of the
                    plantation, and we lived there until 1931 when the plantation was sold as one of
                    the consequences of the Depression. The family then moved to Lexington where I
                    was educated in the public schools. From an early age, I was interested in
                    becoming an Army officer. In part, I was influenced by our neighbor's son, Major
                    Jack Tacket. One of his last assignments was as military attach� in South
                    America. He was such a suave fellow, walking around the courthouse square in his
                    cavalry boots and uniform.</p>
                <p>After graduating from Lexington High School in 1941, I went to Mississippi State
                    College with the object of staying there a year or two and then entering West
                    Point. Congressman Will Whittington had promised my father that he would give me
                    an appointment to the academy. As Lexington had a rather primitive school
                    system, my parents didn't feel that I would be prepared to take the entrance
                    examinations, and I quite agreed with them. Also, I was only 16 years old when I
                    finished high school, and one had to be 17 or 18 to enter West Point in those
                    days.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, in my senior year of high school, I was found to be myopic. Then,
                    in the summer of 1942, I was given an examination in New Orleans at the naval
                    air station at Mr. Whittington's request, and I was told my eyesight was so bad
                    that I would never get into West Point. I went back to Mississippi State for a
                    second year. The war had begun, and I was anxious to get into it; however, so
                    many young Southerners were volunteering for the military that the Selective
                    Service system imposed a requirement that one had to “volunteer” to be drafted,
                    and the waiting period for volunteers to be called up approached a year.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>I went into the army in June 1943, was commissioned in 1945, and stayed in the
                    military with the object of making the army a career. In 1946-47, I was a
                    Company Commander with the reconstituted Philippine Scouts on Luzon. However, in
                    early 1947, I concluded that the last thing the army needed was one more
                    ill-educated southern officer, so I decided to get out and finish college. I
                    chose to study in the field of foreign affairs and, specifically, at Georgetown
                    University because I thought that perhaps I would like to pursue a career as a
                    military attach�. At Georgetown, I met, for the first time, my cousin Robert
                    Edgar Wilson, who was in the Foreign Service and a specialist in Latin American
                    affairs. I finished Georgetown in 1949.</p>
                <p>During my last semester at Georgetown, I was back in the army, and had the
                    opportunity to become a career officer, but I would have had to revert to second
                    lieutenant. I was 25, and the thought of being a 25-year old second lieutenant
                    who was not a West Pointer and competing with West Pointers who were several
                    years younger made me feel that I would be behind the power curve in a military
                    career. I began to reconsider my career options, and Bob said, “Well, why not
                    join the Foreign Service? If you don't like it, you can get out, and it will
                    look great on your r�sum�.”</p>
                <p>I worked as an editor at the Central Intelligence Agency for a year. In 1950 I
                    was offered the opportunity to become a Kreis resident officer in Germany under
                    the post war transition from military occupation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Excuse me, Mel. What is a Kreis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: A Kreis is a county in Germany. A Land is a state. We had a Foreign
                    Service officer in each Kreis in the American military zone of occupation. These
                    officers served under the High Commissioner, who reported to the State
                    Department. I was recruited as a Kreis Resident Officer, but just before I was
                    to leave Washington, I was called in by Alan James, a newly minted Foreign
                    Service officer working in Personnel. Alan said rather accusingly, “Mel, you are
                    not married. We want married Kreis resident officers. We want the wives to work
                    at the PTA and with women's groups as part of the overall democratization of
                    German society.” I replied, “If you look at my application, you will see that I
                    checked 'S' under marital status.” He said, “Well, yes, that's true. We somehow
                    overlooked that. Would you mind very much if we sent you to the Consulate
                    General at Frankfurt for the Displaced Persons Program?”</p>
                <p>That seemed, in a sense, more mainstream Foreign Service work than being a Kreis
                    resident officer, so I readily agreed. I arrived in Germany on January 15, 1951,
                    and was assigned by the Consul General to the Schweinfurt Displaced Persons
                    Camp. The Consul General in Frankfurt was Albert Doyle. He wore three hats, as
                    he was Consul General for the Frankfurt consular district, supervising Consul
                    General for Germany, and State Department Coordinator of the Displaced Persons
                    Program for Europe (Germany, Austria, and Italy).</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Excuse me, could you explain who these displaced persons
                        were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: In Germany after the war, there were millions of displaced persons who,
                    for one reason or another, would not go back to the country from whence they
                    came. Some of them were Jews who had been in the concentration camps. There were
                    Eastern European forced laborers of all religions who had worked in German
                    factories or had been indentured labor in a variety of jobs, for example, as
                    housemaids or cleaning staff in offices, etc. Then, there were non-Germans who
                    had seen the Russian armies coming and had fled ahead of them because they
                    believed they would have a better life under western control than under Soviet
                    control. Finally, the Displaced Persons Act authorized Americans to adopt
                    orphans who were the progeny of displaced persons; this was the first such
                    provision in U.S. immigration legislation.</p>
                <p>The Displaced Persons Camp at Schweinfurt handled all applicants except orphans
                    who received visas only at the Frankfurt Consulate General. To the best of my
                    recollection, we did not have any people from Asia or Asiatic parts of the
                    Soviet Union at Schweinfurt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do with them there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: The Schweinfurt Camp was similar to other displaced persons camps in that
                    officials from three U.S. Government agencies were involved. First, there were
                    Displaced Persons Commission representatives who processed people for visas.
                    They were responsible for obtaining medical examinations, vetting the
                    applicants, obtaining the security records, and housing and feeding applicants
                    in the camp. Second, we consular personnel received the applications for visas
                    and considered applicants on the basis of admissibility under both applicable
                    visa law and the special provisions of the Displaced Persons Act. The third
                    entity at a displaced persons camp was a representative of the Immigration and
                    Naturalization Service (INS) who took the visas and supporting documents from
                    the consular officer and reviewed them to be sure the applicant would be
                    admitted to the United States. He functioned as though he were an INS officer at
                    a port of entry, although the INS officers at the actual ports of entry in the
                    United States had general oversight authority, and the right to refuse somebody
                    even though the applicant had been passed by an INS officer abroad. That
                    happened very rarely, however.In addition to the U.S. Government agencies at
                    Schweinfurt and other displaced persons camps, there also were representatives
                    of voluntary agencies, such as, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, Catholic
                    Relief Services, etc. These agencies were responsible for finding sponsors and
                    jobs in the United States for visa applicants, helping them depart from the
                    displaced persons camps, meeting them when they arrived in the United States,
                    and helping them get settled in their new homes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask, obviously among these thousands of displaced
                        persons, there must have been some Nazi sympathizers. How were they able to
                        be weeded out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: Perhaps the most important tool in the security process was the Berlin
                    Document Center. The Nazis were incredible record keepers. After the war, we
                    gathered up all the documents we could find throughout Germany and put them all
                    in the Berlin Document Center, a very important cache of documents. It was
                    remarkable the sort of details the center held. It had, for example, all the
                    details of where a displaced person came from in Poland or Lithuania, when he
                    was picked up, when he was sent to Germany, where he had worked in Germany, what
                    vetting had been done to him, looking at him as a security problem from the Nazi
                    point of view. On several occasions, it initially appeared that a displaced
                    person had no political leanings whatsoever. Then, subsequent records indicated
                    that he appeared to have been a Nazi, and then appeared to have been something
                    else. I recall once, I was interviewing a fellow, and I said, “You have a
                    dubious background.” I ran through his records. He was astonished, as most of
                    them were, that we had such detailed data. This fellow finally said, “Look, I
                    was picked up in my village. I was sent off, and it was a matter of survival, so
                    I would find out what the people who were holding me wanted to hear, and I would
                    tell them that. That was the way I kept myself alive.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, you mentioned the visas and coming to the U.S. Were
                        any of these people or many of them sent to other countries? Would other
                        countries accept them or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: At the Schweinfurt Camp, there were also an Australian and a Canadian
                    immigration officer. Each of these officers had absolute authority to accept or
                    reject applicants, and there was no appeal from their decisions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how long did you stay there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: I stayed there for about three months, and, when that camp was closed, I
                    was assigned to head up the visa operations at the Hanau displaced persons camp.
                    The operations at Hanau were the same as at Schweinfurt. I stayed there until
                    January 15, 1952, when Albert Doyle asked me to return to Frankfurt to become
                    his Deputy Coordinator for the displaced persons program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Quite a promotion.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>BLAKE: Well, it surprised me. I think a factor that had something to do with me
                    getting this “August” position was that I was single and the job involved a lot
                    of travel. I spent a good deal of time going to the Salzburg, Austria, displaced
                    persons camp, I toured the camps within Germany, and I'd also spend a week out
                    of every month in Berlin. The United States had no camp there; we would hold the
                    visa applications at the Berlin Consulate, and I would go up and take care of
                    them each month. An additional responsibility was the issuance of visas to
                    orphans adopted by U.S. citizens, including my Cousin, Bob Wilson.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, you were based in Frankfurt.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: I was based in Frankfurt. The program ended on June 30, 1952. I stayed
                    around for about a month after that writing a report on the program. Then, the
                    personnel people in Bonn at HICOG had the job of deciding what to do with me.
                    They were more impressed with the title of Deputy European Coordinator than was
                    warranted. They said you can't just go back and be a visa officer after this
                    and, so, assigned me as Principal Officer of the Consulate at Bremerhaven.
                    Bremerhaven had been a consulate from, I think, about the 1870s until 1928, when
                    it was closed for budgetary reasons. However, as Bremerhaven was the only U.S.
                    military port for Germany, the Consulate was reopened in 1946.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What staff did you have in Bremerhaven?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: The State Department opened Bremerhaven primarily to deal with seamen.
                    Bremerhaven was the sole U.S. military port of entry and received, on an
                    annualized basis, 95 ships a month. They were a mix of Defense Department ships
                    in the Military Sea Transport Service (MSTS) and U.S. maritime ships, including
                    both luxury liners and freight ships. Shipping and seamen's affairs were our
                    principal activities. Bremerhaven performed most consular services for American
                    citizens, although it could only take passport applications, which were then
                    forwarded to Bremen for the issuance of the passport.</p>
                <p>We could, however, issue Loss of Citizenship certificates when an American wanted
                    to renounce citizenship. I had several disgruntled seamen insist on renouncing
                    their citizenship, and I would take the application and put it in the safe.
                    Invariably, they would come back in a week or so for some service, primarily a
                    loan, and I would remind them of the renunciation of citizenship. After a time,
                    they always asked whether they could renounce the renunciation, and I would
                    reply that I had found the application in the safe and would tear it up.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>Because destitute Americans could work their way back to the United States, there
                    was considerable activity in assisting these persons, mainly college-age
                    Americans who were touring Europe and ran out of money. Moreover, the Consulate
                    was responsible for all fisheries reporting out of Germany.Foreign Service
                    families on assignment to Germany occasionally arrived by a U.S. Lines passenger
                    ship, and I would meet them and get them on their way to their post. Once,
                    however, I was asked to see off a departing Foreign Service officer. Ambassador
                    George Kennan and his wife left Europe from Bremerhaven after he had been
                    declared persona non grata by the Soviet Union. He was the author of an article
                    in Foreign Affairs under the nom de plume “X” while he was head of the
                    Department's Policy Planning Staff during the late 1940s. In this article he
                    spelled out a containment policy to govern relations for the United States and
                    Western Europe viz-a-viz the Soviet bloc. This policy was followed for some four
                    decades, until the fall of the Soviet Union and the demise of its bloc.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Kennan was appointed to Moscow by President Truman shortly before he
                    left office. By then X had been identified as Kennan. The Soviets reluctantly
                    accepted him as ambassador and began looking for ways to get rid of him. As it
                    happened, incoming Secretary of State John Foster Dulles did not care for
                    Kennan. I don't recall why, but suspect that he disliked the intellectual
                    competition. Any way, in February or March 1953, the Soviets declared Kennan
                    persona non grata and he left Moscow.</p>
                <p>One evening I received a telephone call from Byron Snyder, the Deputy Principal
                    officer at Frankfurt, that Kennan would be leaving on the SS “United States”
                    from Bremerhaven the next morning. Snyder had been called by a senior Foreign
                    Service officer at Bonn that Kennan's friends there considered it a shame that
                    he would be leaving Europe without a send-off. No one, it seemed, actually
                    wanted to contact him for fear that word would get back to Washington and
                    tarnish relations with the new Secretary. As I was at Bremerhaven, it would be
                    appropriate for me to see Ambassador and Mrs. Kennan off.</p>
                <p>I went to the Kennans' stateroom the next morning. The Ambassador and Mrs. Kennan
                    expressed pleasure that I had come. I explained that their friends in Germany
                    had wanted to be there but were unable to make it. The Ambassador expressed
                    understanding of the work pressure they were under, given a new Administration.
                    After 15-20 minutes, I bade them bon voyage and wished the Ambassador good luck
                    on his next appointment. He thanked me again for coming to the ship, then added,
                    somewhat quietly and sadly, “But, I won't be having another appointment.” And he
                    didn't.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>Arising out of the military occupation, the Principal Officer had the somewhat
                    unusual job of serving as committing magistrate under the occupation judicial
                    code. Civilian employees of the U.S. Defense Department who were arrested by
                    Army Military Police or the Navy's Shore Patrol were brought to a magistrate's
                    court, which would consider whether they should be held for trial by a military
                    court. If they were held, they were confined to the stockade. Court was held
                    whenever a person was arrested, and I would go from the Consulate to the
                    military courthouse, don a black magistrate's robe, and hold court. It was a
                    routine chore but did have its lighter moments. Once, a seaman who had deserted
                    a MSTS vessel was brought before me. He was indignant that the military would
                    arrest him even though he was a Defense Department employee, and demanded the
                    seaman's right to see a consular Officer. I granted his wish, left the bench,
                    removed my black robe, and returned to the Consulate. A few minutes later, the
                    Military Police brought him into my office. The seaman recognized me at once and
                    turned on his heel, muttering, “You can't beat city hall.”</p>
                <p>To discharge my duties, I had a staff of two local employees and a Coast Guard
                    contingent assigned to the Consulate. That contingent consisted of a Lieutenant
                    Commander, a Chief Petty Officer, and a German secretary. The Coast Guard
                    personnel covered all of Northern Europe.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your relations with the Consul General in
                        Bremen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: The Principal Officer at Bremerhaven reported to the Consul General at
                    Bremen. Ed MacLaughlin liked to regard himself as having a branch office in
                    Bremerhaven. In fact, he was a little touchy that I had a very close relation
                    with the supervising Consul General in Frankfurt. Quite apart from that, Albert
                    Doyle, as the supervising Consul General, had a very active and aggressive micro
                    manager for his Deputy Principal Officer, Byron Snyder. Byron was a very
                    competent officer, but he wanted to get into everything, so he liked the idea
                    that there was an officer in Bremerhaven with whom he already had a working
                    relationship. Byron would call me several times a week, mainly for assistance in
                    repatriating destitute Americans to the United States. The Consul General at
                    Bremen found this troubling.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your relations with the military in
                        Bremerhaven?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: Oh, they were superb. My predecessor, a fellow named Jack Smith, said,
                    “After you leave this post, it will be years before you can get it out of your
                    system.” I was 28 at the time, and, as the Principal Officer at a consulate, I
                    outranked all the colonels at Bremerhaven. As it happened, there were only
                    Colonels or Captains, which is the Navy equivalent of a Colonel, at Bremerhaven,
                    so I was the ranking American. It was heady stuff, you know, having these
                    Colonels who are old enough to be my father pay their courtesy calls on me after
                    I reported to the post. I must say that they were quite gracious about it.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>Bremerhaven was also a special post for another reason. Rozanne and I married on
                    December 31, 1952. Rozanne was a nurse at the army dispensary, which examined
                    military dependents returning to the United States. She was a civilian employee
                    there, but she had been an Army nurse during World War II in the South
                    Pacific.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, when and where did you take the Foreign Service
                        Exam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: I first took the Foreign Service Exam while I was a junior at Georgetown
                    and got, as I recall, a 68. Then, I took it again and passed at Bremerhaven. In
                    those days, you had to go back to the United States to take the oral exam, which
                    was only given in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The written or the oral?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: The oral. I took the written at post. Orals were only given in Washington,
                    DC, in those days. That was the old three and a half day written exam. You
                    recall it; you probably took it yourself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I did. Now, how long did you remain in
                        Bremerhaven?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: When I joined the Foreign Service in 1951, I was a staff corps officer,
                    which meant I held my commission at the pleasure of the Secretary. I had taken
                    exams and been accepted as a career Staff Corps Officer. In 1953, Secretary of
                    State Dulles decided to put the Department through a massive reduction in force.
                    They did that geographically. I was RIFed from Germany in June 1953 since the
                    Department thought that it had a surplus of consular officers in Europe. I got
                    back to the United States on June 29,1953, my birthday. I took the oral exam
                    later that summer, but was failed. Later, I heard that all oral examinees
                    failed. Under pressure from Senator Joe McCarthy, the Department was putting in
                    place a security screening procedure. Until that system was in place, new hires
                    were being held to an absolute minimum, but the Department did not want to
                    cancel oral examinations as this action might have sent the message that it was
                    giving in to McCarthyism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. That was the year, 1953, that the Department canceled the
                        writteexams. I think that you are right.</hi>

                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>BLAKE: I left the Foreign Service and took a position with the Loudon Times
                    Mirror in Leesburg, Virginia. My appetite for the Foreign Service, however, had
                    been whetted by Frankfurt and Bremerhaven, and I was all the more interested in
                    a Foreign Service career. After about six months, I was asked to return to the
                    Foreign Service, again in a staff capacity, to work on the Refugee Relief
                    Program (RRP). This program was intended to take care of a category of persons
                    who were forcibly expelled from Eastern Europe and had not met the criteria of
                    the Displaced Persons Act. Primarily, they were people of German extraction who
                    had been expelled from their countries after the War or had fled from their
                    countries because they feared Soviet retaliation. These so-called Volksdeutsche
                    had been a factor in German politics since the 1600s. They and German groups in
                    the United States who supported them felt an injustice had been done, because
                    these people, in many instances, had no control over their fate.</p>
                <p>They also presented a more difficult political problem, because many of them had
                    been members of the German army. In fact, the German army recruited minority
                    groups from Eastern Europe into special units, for example, the Latvian Waffen
                    SS. I can't precisely recall the names now, but they would have had a special
                    contingent of Polish Germans in the army or Russian Germans or Ukrainians who
                    were really quite anti-Soviet. These were not people who were necessarily Nazis;
                    they were Germans who felt that they had been treated badly in their countries,
                    and the German military had come, and they were delighted to work with them.</p>
                <p>I returned to the Foreign Service on June 29, 1954. Like the Displaced Persons
                    Program, this Program was active in Germany, Austria, and Italy. I arrived at
                    Bonn in early July. Rozanne stayed behind, as she was too pregnant to travel. I
                    studied assiduously for the Foreign Service written exam and passed once again.
                    This was the last three and one-half day written exam given by the
                    Department.</p>
                <p>When I reached Germany, the RRP had just been started. There was really nothing
                    for me to do. The office of the supervising Consul General had been transferred
                    from Frankfurt, following Albert Doyle's retirement, to Bonn. Herve L'Heureux
                    had come in as Executive Director - that was actually the chief administrative
                    officer. He also was named the supervising Consul General as he had a strong
                    consular background and had been Chief of the Visa Office in the Department
                    before coming to Bonn. The RRP also was under him. He asked me to take on a
                    rather interesting job as Executive Secretary of the U.S.-German War Crimes
                    Clemency and Parole Board.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Explain about that. There aren't many Foreign Service
                        officerwho have done this sort of work.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>BLAKE: True. The war crimes trials, which most Americans know, were the Nuremberg
                    quadripartite trials of the major war criminals, such as Goering and Hess. They
                    were conducted under international auspices and established a new body of
                    international law. After these Nuremberg trials ended, each of the four
                    occupying powers (the United States, France, the Soviet Union, and the United
                    Kingdom) asserted the authority, the right, to try lesser war crimes suspects
                    who were picked up in their military zones of occupation. So, there were four
                    separate war crimes trials, U.S., French, British, and Soviet. The United States
                    also conducted these trials at Nuremberg.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And, as I recall, most of the real scoundrels had fled out
                        of thSoviet zone and into the West.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: They really wanted to get out of the Soviet zone of occupation, and those
                    who were unable to make it were treated harshly by the Soviets. In fact, most of
                    them thought that if they could get to the American zone of occupation, they
                    would receive the fairest treatment. Now, lesser war criminals were those whose
                    acts were less heinous than those of Goering, Hess, or the other major war
                    criminals. Some of the U.S. war crimes trials that I recall included the
                    doctors' trial, trials of industrialists who had used captive labor, and
                    persons, either German military or civilians, who had killed downed U.S. airmen
                    or American prisoners of war. We also tried a number of concentration and labor
                    camp officials and guards. Then, there were some notorious characters, for
                    example, Major General Sepp Dietrich, who was Commanding General of the SS
                    division that was involved in the Malmedy Massacre.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Out of which Marlene Dietrich made that great movie,
                        Judgment aNuremberg.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: Right. These trials were also held at Nuremberg. Many defendants were
                    given the death sentence, but, for one reason or another, not all were executed.
                    Of course, many had sentences of life imprisonment or lesser sentences. When
                    these trials ended in 1949, there was an entirely different international
                    situation. The Berlin blockade had been imposed, the Cold War was on, and NATO
                    had been established. The United States recognized that it had to change its
                    relationship toward its occupation zone. The military government, under the
                    Department of Defense's control, was ended and replaced by the High Commission
                    for Germany, which was under the Department of State. The British and the French
                    made a similar change. Responsibility for these prisoners was transferred from
                    the military to the High Commission. John J. McCloy was the first High
                    Commissioner.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was. General Clay was the last military governor, and
                        theMcCloy came in as high commissioner.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>BLAKE: That's correct. John McCloy was married to Conrad Adenauer's sister
                    in-law. In fact, there were three sisters. One married McCloy, one married West
                    German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, and the third married a prominent French
                    diplomat, either the French Foreign Minister or the French High Commissioner for
                    Germany. McCloy recognized that we had to remove the lesser war criminals from
                    the list of issues that could become contentious as we normalized relations with
                    Germany.</p>
                <p>Under German law at that time, there was no death penalty. One of the first
                    things McCloy did was to commute the death sentences to life. We then had a
                    situation where we would be holding Germans for life, many of them quite young
                    fellows while, at the same time, also trying to normalize relations with
                    Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they held in American prisons?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: Yes, the prisoners who had been tried by U.S. courts were held in American
                    prisons maintained by the Army. So, we established - with the French and British
                    - bilateral clemency and parole boards to review these cases. Each bilateral
                    board had five members, three U.S. (or British or French) and two Germans. The
                    first Chairman of the U.S.-German War Crimes Clemency and Parole Board was Henry
                    Lee Shattuck, a prominent Boston lawyer and friend of Secretary of State Dulles.
                    The other U.S. members were Minister Edwin Plitt, a Foreign Service officer
                    whose previous position was as the principal U.S. representative in Tangier, and
                    Army Lt. General Walter Mueller. As for the German members, one was a member of
                    the state supreme court for Baden-Wurttemberg, and the other was a high state
                    Justice Department official from Bavaria.</p>
                <p>The Americans always had the voting majority, 3-2. There were a number of 3-2
                    decisions, but the Americans recognized the correctness of what Mr. McCloy
                    wanted to do and, while maintaining objectivity, redressed a number of
                    injustices and paroled prisoners who had been harshly sentenced or where there
                    might have been flaws in the trial. I recall, for example, one case where the
                    defendant had been sentenced to death on one witness' hearsay and another case
                    where the defense attorney had been absent for lengthy periods during the trial
                    and had commented to the judge that the prosecuting attorney could fill him in
                    on what he had missed that evening. Toward the end, however, policy became even
                    more liberal, and the objective was to remove all prisoners from the U.S.
                    prison.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>Petitioners for clemency and parole submitted applications to the Board through
                    HICOG. As Executive Secretary, I reviewed each application, prepared a summary
                    of each petitioner's offences and conviction, and presented the application and
                    related documents to the Board. The Board would then consider the case, decide
                    whether or not the person deserved clemency or parole, and send it back to me. I
                    then would make arrangements for the Board's decision to be communicated to the
                    petitioner. We worked with the legal division of the HICOG. The Prisons Officer,
                    Richard Hagen, received applications from petitioners and communicated the
                    Board's decisions back to them.</p>
                <p>When Mr. Shattuck left in mid-1955, he was replaced as Chairman by Mr. Plitt, who
                    asked me to become a Board member. But, I declined for the reason, which Mr.
                    Plitt accepted, that the German members might think that the United States was
                    downplaying the importance of the Board by putting the Executive Secretary, a
                    junior official, on it. Instead, Mr. Hagen was placed on the Board.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get much pressure from the German government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: In the United States and Germany, a number of groups considered it a
                    political (and perhaps business) mistake for the United States to be holding
                    German prisoners for, what could be, some decades; but, I am not aware that the
                    German Government ever attempted to apply pressure on the Board. There was one
                    interesting case, however, which resulted in an outcry. That was the Sepp
                    Dietrich case.</p>
                <p>General Dietrich was sentenced to death because he was commander of the division
                    that committed the Malmedy massacre. General Dietrich was convicted for several
                    reasons. First, he was a Waffen SS officer. I should say that the SS could, and
                    did, include the people who had run the concentration camps as well as the
                    Waffen SS, which was somewhat like the green berets in the American army or the
                    commandos. They were shock troops, very aggressive soldiers. Sepp Dietrich had
                    done two things that caused the wrath of the occupiers; yet, they were things
                    that were perfectly natural under the German military procedure. The first was
                    he had given his troops a general order to fight aggressively, so aggressively
                    that a wave of terror would precede them. The second was his pep talk to his
                    troops immediately before they launched the Battle of the Bulge in which he
                    pretty much repeated that exhortation.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>If you consider what a football coach tells his team before a game, you will see
                    that what Sepp Dietrich said to his troops was certainly within the realm of
                    gearing up your men. But, if you look at it in terms of the political situation
                    and what happened at Malmedy, it is an entirely different matter. Certainly, it
                    was amenable to misinterpretation. I should say that the German government never
                    put pressure on the American Board members or on anyone else concerning the
                    Dietrich case. Also, I never heard of the German members of the Board, in their
                    individual capacity, urging that the Sepp Dietrich case be taken up. But,
                    inevitably, his application for parole came up, and the Board had to deal with
                    it. After considering the application for a couple of days, the Board decided
                    that Dietrich's crime did not warrant further detention, and he should be
                    considered for parole. The German Government, as best I recall, was restrained
                    in its reaction. The German press treated the decision as a routine news item,
                    but the American press picked it up and gave it some prominence.</p>
                <p>This, of course, got back to Washington, and the Office of German Affairs
                    professed to be very embarrassed, saying they would have to review the situation
                    etc. Actually, there was no legal or other basis for overturning the Board's
                    decision. In fact, the Office of German Affairs should not have been so taken
                    aback, because HICOG had reported that the decision had been reached and the
                    bases for reaching it, so that the Department could alert its press office and
                    be prepared to handle the consequences. There was a flurry of indignation in
                    Congress, and Ed Plitt received a back channel message from the Department
                    saying he was really on his own on this. The State Department would not help him
                    in his explanations; rather, as Chairman of the Board, he would have to handle
                    that on his own. He had a couple of interviews, and the affair passed on. I
                    think that the Board made the right decision.</p>
                <p>There was a more interesting case related to Malmedy, and that involved the last
                    war criminal in custody. I do not remember his first name, but his last name was
                    Christ. He was a German Captain who was the officer in charge of the tank
                    company that actually committed the Malmedy massacre. Captain Christ had been
                    sentenced to death, and then under this general commutation, his sentence was
                    commuted to life in prison. The Malmedy massacre occurred in mid-December of
                    1944. Captain Christ had been called to battalion headquarters for a meeting of
                    the officers to get their attack orders for the next phase of the campaign. He
                    left his tank company at dusk, went to headquarters, and then came back a couple
                    of hours later, by which time it was dark. The Lieutenant, his executive
                    officer, had the troops ready to roll, so the tank company proceeded down the
                    road. Christ claimed that he only learned of the massacre at Malmedy several
                    days later. He was sentenced to death, because his troops had committed this
                    outrageous crime. His defense was: “I knew nothing about it. I was not there. I
                    only heard of it several days later. I was as outraged as anyone, but I was
                    immediately captured, so there was never any opportunity for me to do anything
                    about the massacre.”</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>Nevertheless, he was sentenced to death, his sentence then was commuted to life,
                    and he was in prison, where he learned that he could apply for clemency and
                    parole. In the applications, he would have to admit guilt and profess remorse.
                    Christ said, “I did not know of the crime; I had no part in the crime. Of
                    course, I have remorse that it happened, but I can't accept guilt for a crime I
                    did not commit.” Thus, he never applied for clemency or parole. It came down to
                    a point where he was the only war criminal in prison. They were holding him in
                    Bavaria in a small castle, and Dick Hagen, as Prisons Officer, would go down
                    from time to time and say, “Captain Christ, won't you please apply for clemency
                    and parole.” Christ would reply, “No I didn't do anything. I am being held in a
                    perversion of justice.” I have no idea how it turned out, but when the War
                    Crimes Clemency and Parole Board was dissolved, there was still one prisoner:
                    Captain Christ.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Christ was still there. Well, that sounds like an
                        interestinand unusual assignment. What happened after that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: When the Board finished its work in early 1956, I returned to the Refugee
                    Relief Program (RRP). By then, the Department had assigned Don Smith, an officer
                    with extensive commercial but no consular experience, as supervising Consul
                    General and Director of the RRP for Germany and Austria - the program had
                    finished work in Italy by 1956. Don named me his Special Assistant for Consular
                    Affairs and Deputy Coordinator of the RRP.</p>
                <p>By then, we had sufficient visa officers in place throughout the consulates in
                    Germany and at the Consulate at Salzburg where RRP visas were issued for
                    applicants in Austria. We didn't establish camps in this case as we had for
                    displaced persons at Schweinfurt; applicants for these visas lived on the
                    economy. We used the consular personnel, but we had them all prepared to issue
                    refugee relief visas in addition to visas under the standing visa laws. That was
                    easy to do because there were basically no applicants. As I remarked earlier,
                    these were Volksdeutsche, people of German background. They could assimilate
                    into Germany, whose economy was growing by leaps and bounds.</p>

                    the United States when, here in Germany, I have friends, relatives etc.?” So,
                    applicants would get Refugee Relief immigration visas, which, as I recall, were
                    valid for either three or six months. When their visas expired, they would come
                    back and get them renewed. Then, they would come back and get them renewed
                    again. They would just have this visa in their hip pocket as an insurance policy
                    in the event something politically dire happened or the German economy turned
                    down, in which case they would then go to the United States.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: That's right. But, they were perfectly content where they were. This
                    became something of a scandal as people in Washington could not understand why
                    the Volksdeutsche would pass up the opportunity to emigrate from Germany to the
                    United States when the displaced persons had been blithe to go. It came to the
                    attention of Eleanor Lansing Dulles, who was in the Office of German Affairs, in
                    the Department of State. Eleanor announced that she was coming over to look into
                    why the RRP was not getting off the ground. Congressmen were complaining that
                    they had been pressured to pass special visa legislation that no one seemed
                    interested in. There also were certain German groups in the United States
                    wanting to know what was happening. They kept extending job opportunities to
                    Volksdeutsche, but these people were not accepting them.</p>
                <p>Harry Grossman, the Refugee Reports Officer in Germany, wrote a very detailed and
                    comprehensive report on all of the circumstances that led to the failure of more
                    Volksdeutsche to take advantage of this opportunity to immigrate to the United
                    States. Harry's report reached Washington in time for Eleanor to read it before
                    leaving for Bonn. Harry Grossman, Harry Schwartz who was Deputy in the political
                    section but also followed this sort of thing, and I met with Eleanor Dulles.
                    Harry Grossman made a very detailed presentation of the situation in Germany
                    with respect to Volksdeutsche. Harry Schwartz made a few noncommittal comments.
                    I listened from the sidelines. Eleanor listened to all of this. Then, she turned
                    to Grossman and said, “I find your report interesting. I forwarded it to my
                    brother (Secretary of State John Foster Dulles), and then I sent it to my other
                    brother (CIA Director Alan Dulles). All three of us have read it, and all three
                    of us reject your findings.”I have never seen anyone as deflated as poor Harry
                    Grossman was at that point. Then, Harry Schwartz attempted to placate Eleanor
                    and explained to her really what was going on here in Germany and asked her to
                    be patient. I assured her that we were doing everything we could and we had all
                    the people in place and so on. All we needed were applicants to be serious about
                    applying for Refugee Relief visas. Eleanor went back to the States not happy but
                    with a better understanding.</p>
                <p>The Refugee Relief Program limped along until the October 1956 Hungarian
                    uprising. For several days, Budapest was the scene of demonstrations by
                    Hungarians who wanted to re-establish democracy in their country. The Soviets
                    put that down, and tens of thousands of Hungarians fled to Austria. The State
                    Department very quickly determined that these people met the requirements of the
                    RRP. There was one provision of the Refugee Relief Act where applicants were the
                    precursors to what we now call political refugees. We regarded these people as
                    political refugees, issued them RRP visas in Austria, sent them off to the
                    States, and declared the RRP a success.</p>

                <p>BLAKE: Thanks to Hungary. Otherwise the RRP would have been a failure. It was,
                    nevertheless, one of the forerunners, one of the determiners, one of the
                    activities that led to the United States refining our visa legislation to
                    include political refugees as a category.</p>

                <p>BLAKE: That's right. It started people thinking about what we really ought to do

                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: The RRP ended in the first part of 1957, and I was told they wanted to
                    keep me in Bonn. As it happened, Rozanne was pregnant again, this time with our
                    fourth child, and it was rather late to transfer me. Rebecca Wellington, if you
                    ever knew Becky, wanted me to come into the Political Section to work on Berlin
                    access and other West-East German border problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I worked for her in Berlin. I know Rebecca.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: I was interested, but an opportunity came along that I thought was a bit
                    more promising: that was to be Special Assistant to the Minister for Economic
                    Affairs, a man named Henry Tasca. Henry had just come in from Rome where he had
                    been Economics Minister and head of the Economic Assistance Program, and he was
                    given these same jobs in Bonn. He replaced Jack Tuthill, who was very popular; I
                    think that practically anyone who came in after Jack would have had some
                    problems filling his shoes in the eyes of the staff. Henry was an entirely
                    different sort of person, and he was regarded as somewhat abrasive by members of
                    the staff. I found Tasca quite an agreeable person so I went with him. I was his
                    Special Assistant from January or February of '57 until I left in early October
                    1958. In addition to serving as Special Assistant, I represented the American
                    Embassy on a joint U.S.-British-French working group on two decartelization
                    cases, the Krupp and Thyssen cases, still pending from the occupation.</p>

                <p>I should add here that I passed the 1954 written exam. I was told that if I would
                    pay my way back to the United States, I could take the oral exam. That seemed to
                    me a bit of an imposition, because, in those days, we had the so-called Wriston
                    program. At the Embassy in Bonn, we had a Board, which examined people to bring
                    them in as Foreign Service officers from the Department of State or from their
                    staff capacities. I thought, “Well, gee, why can't this Board hear me here so I
                    won't have this expense?” But, the Department took the position that the Wriston
                    boards could not consider people coming in as FSO-6s - they could only consider
                    them from FSO-5 and higher. They said that the probationary 6 category had to be
                    considered a special category. In fact, my staff position would have qualified
                    me to come into the Foreign Service as an FSO-5. But, I wanted to come in
                    through the front door. You recall that FSOs in the 1950s were really quite
                    exorcized over the Wriston program, which permitted Department and Staff
                    officers to obtain a Presidential commission without going through the
                    examination procedures to which Foreign Service officers had been subjected.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very much so.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: If I was going to play on the team, I wanted to come in through the front
                    door. So, I refused an offer to come in as an FSO-5 under the Wriston program.
                    But, I also didn't want to have to pay my way back; I thought that was wrong. I
                    was working out something with Allen Moreland, who was political advisor at
                    Usaeur in Heidelberg. Alan was arranging a flight for me back to Washington on a
                    military aircraft. At the last moment, the Foreign Service Board of Examiners
                    decided to set up an oral examining board in Frankfurt, Germany. It consisted of
                    three people: John Burns, Consul General at Frankfurt and Chairman of the
                    Examining Board; Ted Hadraba, Consul General at Stuttgart; and Fritz Jandry, who
                    was Deputy Chief of Mission in Copenhagen at that time. Funnily enough, Fritz
                    Jandry had been on the Board that I went before to become a career staff officer
                    in 1952, as well as on the FSO Oral Examining Board before which I had appeared
                    in 1953.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, he is familiar with the Blake style.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>BLAKE: It was kind of funny. John Burns and Ted Hadraba knew me because I had
                    been Special Assistant to the supervising Consul General, their boss.
                    Apparently, Fritz did not recognize my name. As I entered the room, Fritz looked
                    up and said, “I believe we have met before. I don't recall quite where.” I
                    explained it to him. We sat down and had a rather nice discussion for about 45
                    minutes. Then, John Burns asked “Who won the Pulitzer prizes this year?” I said,
                    “Gee, I don't know! Have they been announced?” Then, Ted jumped in, “In the year
                    you were out of the Foreign Service, you were working for a newspaper in
                    Leesburg, Virginia, and you don't know who won the Pulitzer Prize?” I replied,
                    “I do apologize. My wife and I got up early yesterday in Bonn and drove down to
                    Kronberg to play golf all day, because I thought that would be a nice way to
                    relax. We played at Kronberg castle, had a leisurely dinner, got to bed early,
                    and here I am before you.” John said, “Oh really, you played Kronberg? I joined
                    that club last week. On Sunday, I was out walking around the golf course. What
                    can you tell me about it?” So we talked for about 20 minutes about the golf
                    course. Then John said, “Well, you are finished.” I left, came back in the
                    afternoon, and Oscar Holder, his Deputy said, “Well, the board passed you. They
                    interviewed 27 people and only passed nine of the 27.”</p>
                <p>To my mind, this was a bit of an injustice. This board saw only people who were
                    staff Foreign Service officers. They didn't interview private citizens living in
                    Europe who had passed the written exam and wanted to take the oral. In those
                    days, you had to pass the written exam, and you also had to pass the language
                    exam before you could take the oral exam. These were people with Foreign Service
                    experience and language competency, yet the Board rejected two-thirds of the
                    applicants. I thought it was applying standards that were harsh while others
                    without the same Foreign Service experience or language competency were being
                    Wristonized all around them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, after you finished your job with Tasca, what
                        happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: I was transferred to the Department in November 1958 to the Office of
                    Foreign Economic Reporting. This office administered something called The
                    Comprehensive Economic Reporting Program or CERP. It also wrote evaluations of
                    economic reporting on all the posts abroad. This goes to a concept, which I
                    think has been lost sight of over the years. Today, we think of the Foreign
                    Service as part of the State Department; but, if you go back and read the
                    Foreign Service Act of 1946, we were Foreign Service officers to the U.S.
                    government not just the State Department. Foreign Service Officers were the
                    overseas arm of all the economic departments, for example, Labor, Commerce,
                    Interior, etc.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>I have heard Senator Fulbright speak on the Foreign Service Act. He said that he
                    felt perfectly within the terms of the Act to say that the Foreign Service is as
                    much the arm of the Congress as it is the arm of the Executive Branch. It is not
                    the Foreign Service of the State Department. The Act did, however, interpose the
                    Secretary between the President and the Foreign Service, and also between the
                    President and Ambassadors. If my memory serves me correctly, when this Act was
                    passed in 1946, 35 Foreign Service officers quit in protest. I was told that by
                    Orm Wilson, Jr., whose father was one of the 35.</p>
                <p>Now, back to what I did in CERP. I was in charge of economic reporting from
                    Europe and also was the Deputy Chief of the Evaluations Staff. For two years, I
                    evaluated economic reporting out of Europe and noted outstanding reporting
                    officers for special recognition. Of course, I had peripheral duties, such as
                    determining whether the economic reporting tasks were onerous and adjusting
                    reporting schedules, but the basic job was evaluation. I was quite interested in
                    getting into international economic affairs, and I had the opportunity after two
                    years to go into the Office of Regional Affairs in the European Bureau. This was
                    a rather interesting opportunity.</p>
                <p>In 1961, a change was being made from the Organization of European Economic
                    Cooperation (OEEC), which was established by the United States as a means of
                    equitably dispensing aid to Europe under the Marshall Plan and helping in the
                    general reinvigoration of the European economies. The OEEC had outlived its
                    usefulness, and, although the U.S. had established it, we were not members. We
                    were observers. The OEEC was replaced by the Organization for Economic
                    Cooperation and Development (OECD), in which the U.S. and Canada became members.
                    I went into the office just after all of the negotiations had been completed.
                    Our job was to get the OECD Treaty through the Senate, and then set up all of
                    the activities to bring the organization into being with the U.S. as a full
                    member.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we send an ambassador to the OECD?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: After he had left Bonn, Jack Tuthill had been heavily engaged in making
                    this organizational change as the head of RA, the office of regional affairs
                    during the negotiations period. Then, he was detached from that office, and
                    Russell Fessenden came in to replace him. Jack was sent to Paris, and became the
                    first Ambassador to the OECD. Russ was the head of RA. There were two divisions,
                    Economic Affairs and Political Military Affairs. Economic Affairs fell under
                    Manny Abrams, and Political Military Affairs was under Bob Magill. That division
                    handled NATO affairs.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>Our division was a bit larger and had three branches: one handled EEC affairs
                    under Dick Vine; the second dealt with OECD affairs under John Renner to whom I
                    was Deputy; and the third dealt with the Council of Europe affairs, sort of a
                    mixed bag of things under Ruth Phillips. John gave me the trade and monetary
                    affairs portfolios in the office, which meant that I worked a good bit with the
                    Export-Import Bank and the Treasury Department. In addition, I was responsible
                    within the office for two rather arcane codes, the code on invisible
                    transactions and the code on capital movements. None of us in the State
                    Department ever really understood these things. In part, that was because we
                    were not as deeply involved as Treasury or some of the other branches; but, also
                    it was due, in part, to the fact that these two codes dealt with matters that
                    were relatively new to foreign policy. For example, it was years before
                    intellectual property was recognized as an important component in international
                    trade. In the early 1960s, people were not as aware of the importance of
                    copyrights and things of that sort in international trade as they are today.</p>
                <p>In May of 1961, Allen Fidel, who was in charge of selecting economic officers to
                    go to advanced economic training, telephoned that my name was on the list to go
                    to advanced economic training. I had not applied for economic training and was
                    not keen to go. So, I said that I just got into the OECD job, and it would be
                    something of an embarrassment to me and unfair to the office if I left after
                    about eight or nine months, particularly when the OECD was just being
                    established. He said, “I beg your pardon,” and that was the end of it. However,
                    in April 1962, Allen called again and said, “We let you off the hook last year,
                    but this year you have to go to advanced economic training. No ifs, ands, or
                    buts; now, tell us where you want to go.” I said, “Give me a little time.” I
                    wrote him a memorandum and said I am in the Office of Regional Economic
                    Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: RPE by that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: It was still RA, but I was in economic affairs within RA. In the
                    memorandum, I wrote that I was very interested in regional affairs and would
                    like to study the theory of integration. I would like to worship at the feet of
                    James Meade, who was at Cambridge, England. I thought that would kill it...that
                    they would say, “We'd like to do that, but we just can't send you to England
                    because it would cost too much money.” About three months later, Alan telephoned
                    that I had an interesting idea, but wondered whether it could be amended to send
                    me to the London School of Economics (LSE) instead of Cambridge.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>Alan explained that there were three reasons to prefer LSE. First, LSE was
                    regarded as a good economics school. Second, Joe Greenwald followed economic
                    integration affairs at the embassy and could be my contact on what was actually
                    happening in integration. A third factor was that Prime Minister Harold
                    Macmillian had applied for the United Kingdom to enter the European Economic
                    Community, and it was a very contentious issue. It would mean a lot to the
                    United States whether the British application was accepted or rejected. The
                    reasoning was sound, so off we went to London in August 1962.</p>
                <p>We were in London through July 1963. The London School of Economics regarded me
                    as a research fellow, and I concentrated on international finance, banking, and
                    trade. As you recall, the British application to join the EEC was rejected in
                    deference to De Gaulle. I came up for reassignment. The Department noted that I
                    had had only European experience and decided to send me to Central America as
                    the Central American Common Market was just getting off the ground. Since there
                    was no position open in Guatemala at ROCAP, the Regional Office for Central
                    America and Panama, I was made head of the economic section in Costa Rica, which
                    was one of the more interesting and dynamic countries in that area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me go back a moment to the London School of Economics
                        if I may ask a question or two. Did you detect any anti-U.S. bias in the
                        London School, which, from my days in London, was considered quite leftist
                        under Harold Laski and others?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: The main problem at the London School of Economics involved their
                    questions o“What do we do with this fellow? We are delighted to have him, but we
                    don't know what to call him.” Hence, LSE put me down as a research fellow. Since
                    I was well into my 30s at that point, they also permitted me into various
                    discussion groups - in particular, a monthly and rather serious discussion group
                    on economic integration - that were not open to the students.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was your interest there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: This was at the time of the Bay of Pigs, and there was great agitation on
                    the part of the student body of the London School of Economics, and the leftists
                    blockaded the Embassy for about two or three months. You had to pass through
                    student lines to get in and so on. I once remarked to Elim O'Shaughnessy, whom I
                    had known in Bonn and was at that time Political Counselor in London, that I
                    used to go to the Embassy every two weeks to throw rocks and pick up my
                    paycheck. There was not so much a feeling against me from the students, as we
                    really had very little contact. I did, of course, have contact with the American
                    students, of which some were actually thinking of entering the Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>The students were younger than I and were basically bachelors. In fact, I had a
                    rather set course of study. I was working under two mentors there who would give
                    reading assignments and things of that sort, so there was really very little
                    time for schmoozing. I might also remark that I was married and had five young
                    children, which set me apart from the other students and took my free time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were a commuter then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: I was really commuting to a job at the London School oEconomics more than
                    leading a typical student's life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the courses very helpful to you in your later
                        career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: Yes, I suppose so, but not to the extent that I would have thought.
                    Frankly, London may have had a slightly perverse effect on my career by
                    distorting my record and slowing down promotion. In the British university
                    system, you don't take exams at the end of the course. You study, and then, when
                    you are ready to take your masters exams, you take the exam. Generally, that is
                    a two-year course of study. You work under your mentor, who directs you as he
                    thinks you ought to be reading or taking courses or things of that sort. But,
                    there are no exams. There are no class enrollments, no calling of the roll in
                    the beginning of each class or that sort of thing. It ultimately presented me
                    with something of an embarrassment in relations with the Department. The
                    academic year was to end in late July 1963, and, in late May, Barbara Morlet,
                    who handled advanced economics training at the Foreign Service Institute, asked
                    me to have the school send a transcript of my grades. I went to the registrar
                    and said I had been asked for the school to do this. She firmly replied, “We
                    don't have that. We don't do that. You tell your people that that is not the way
                    we do things here in London.” I wrote a letter to Barbara saying that is not the
                    way they do it. Then, Barbara sent back a note saying we really have to have
                    something.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>Then, she telephoned. She said, “The reason we need this, Mel, is that sending
                    people to college is somewhat controversial. We have to be able to defend
                    ourselves before Congressional appropriations committees and convince them that
                    we are getting our money out of advanced Economic studies. One way to do that is
                    to send the committees what we have on file in case anyone asks what the grades
                    are or something. You, in a sense, are kind of a lightning rod, because you are
                    the first person we have ever sent abroad for advanced economic training.” Now,
                    they did send some people for African studies and to military schools abroad but
                    not to study economics. I went back to the registrar and said, “You know, they
                    are terribly upset in Washington. You have to give them something to have in the
                    files.” She said, “Tell me the courses you have been monitoring, and I'll see
                    what I can do.” I gave her a list of the courses I had been monitoring and also
                    explained the various discussion groups in which I participated. The Registrar
                    then wrote a letter to the Foreign Service Institute giving this information.
                    The Department was not happy with this outcome, and it ended up that another
                    officer, who was well advanced down the pipeline to attend LSE after me, and I
                    were the only officers ever sent abroad for advanced economics training.</p>
                <p>Now back to ROCAP. The Regional Office for Central American and Panama was set up
                    to encourage economic integration in Central America. It was a joint AID-State
                    operation. In many respects, it was similar to the Organization for European
                    Economic Cooperation, which had been established to administer Marshall Plan aid
                    to Europe just after the Second World War. Gardner Ainsworth, a State Department
                    officer who had been Minister for Economic Affairs in Rome, was in charge of
                    ROCAP. His Deputy was a senior AID officer. After establishing ROCAP, the
                    Department started thinking about what its role would be, and, since our
                    involvement was primarily on the development side, all the other positions in
                    ROCAP were staffed by AID officers. In the circumstances, I was sent to Costa
                    Rica as head of the economic section.</p>
                <p>The Ambassador to Costa Rica was Raymond Telles, who was from El Paso, Texas. He
                    was very active in the John F. Kennedy campaign, and was credited with bringing
                    the Hispanic vote to Kennedy and winning several of the key state races. His
                    Deputy was Phil Raine, really a Brazilian expert and a man who spent his entire
                    career in Latin America.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>The job as head of the Economic Section was a conventional job with standout
                    activities in providing assistance to American business. The principal American
                    investment in Costa Rica was being undertaken by Alcoa. Alcoa was trying to
                    develop a major alumina operation, which experienced difficulties because, as we
                    learned over time, the Alcoa negotiator had a drinking problem. He was replaced
                    by management when they realized his unreliability. A small U.S. corporation,
                    which was not in the oil business, was establishing a refinery which had the
                    U.S. Government concerned as it was thought that it would adversely impact the
                    American oil companies in Costa Rica. In fact, I learned that they didn't care.
                    And Dole among others was establishing a Costa Rican operation to supply the
                    U.S. market. Dole sought my view on Costa Rica as a site for a pineapple
                    plantation to reduce costs of their Hawaiian operations. As Costa Rica's central
                    plateau is of volcanic origin and quite rich soil, I thought it a fine idea,
                    adding that the Costa Rican pineapples were the best I had ever eaten. The Dole
                    representatives replied that they would bring pineapple seeds from Hawaii as the
                    Costa Rican pineapples were too large to fit in their cans and so sweet that
                    they would not conform to their manufacturing formula.</p>
                <p>The other out-of-the-ordinary activity was on U.S. bond issues and other
                    financial obligations on which the Costa Rican Government had defaulted; one
                    went back to the 1870s. With the AID Mission, I worked on ways to assist the
                    Costa Rican Government in improving its economic performance so that it could
                    resume servicing its debts to the United States.</p>
                <p>Economic integration did not go well primarily because of jealousies among the
                    Central American countries. Each one wanted to maximize its benefit under the
                    AID program and stick its finger in the eye of its neighbor. It really didn't
                    work out. In a technical sense, Panama is not a Central American Country, it is
                    a South American country; nevertheless, it was rather important in that area and
                    yet wasn't involved. It was not a member of the Central American common market,
                    for example. The U.S. Government hoped that Panama would be accepted into the
                    common market, but Panama had a higher per capita income and was more dynamic
                    than the other countries, and the Central Americans were very suspicious of
                    allowing Panama in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it used dollars as currency.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: The Central American governments were concerned that the U.S. Government
                    might favor Panama over the rest of the region in disbursing aid as a means of
                    reducing Panamanian hostility to continued U.S. control of the Panama Canal, and
                    they feared Panama's relative economic strength as Panama had a higher per
                    capita income than any Central American country. Because of jealousies and
                    animosities, Central American integration really never got off the ground. I was
                    in Costa Rica from September 1963 through November 1965. After that, we had this
                    so-called soccer war between El Salvador and Honduras, which was a conflict that
                    developed out of a game that was supposed to promote Central American harmony.
                    In point of fact, it promoted the war, and Central America integration fell into
                    chaos. By that time, I had been transferred back to the Department.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the influence of Fidel Castro in Costa Rica?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: None. There was, however, a school for political training outside San Jose
                    and Fidel Castro had been a student at that school along with a number of other
                    leftist leaders from throughout Latin America. I suppose it enjoyed a great deal
                    of support from the Pepe Figueres Party in Costa Rica, but Pepe Figueres and the
                    other members of the party were not communist and were not supporters of Castro.
                    I got to know Pepe Figueres rather well. Figueres is Catalan, in fact the first
                    city of any consequence after you enter Spain from France on the Mediterranean
                    side is Figueres. Figueres would talk quite candidly about his conversations
                    with Castro. He used to say that he told Castro that he was going down the wrong
                    road, and should be a Social Democrat rather than a communist.</p>
                <p>This school was commonly regarded as a socialist training ground and presumed to
                    enjoy socialist financial support. Shortly after I left Costa Rica, I was amused
                    by published reports, which were confirmed, that the Central Intelligence Agency
                    also supported the school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you in Costa Rica when President Kennedy
                        visited?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: I got there just four or five months after Kennedy had visited. It was
                    probably one of the most popular visits Kennedy ever made abroad. The day
                    Kennedy left, Irazu, the volcano east of San Jose, began to erupt. There were
                    tremendous eruptions for some months. The Costa Ricans were fond of saying that
                    the country was crying because Kennedy left. The eruptions had a rather
                    devastating temporary affect on the country's economy, particularly the Mesata
                    Central, a very prosperous coffee-growing region of the country. The volcanic
                    dust devastated the coffee crop for that year. The mountain ceased erupting the
                    day Kennedy was assassinated, although there were occasional puffs of volcanic
                    ash for the next year or so. The Costa Ricans would say that Irazu cried when it
                    saw Kennedy's plane depart but ceased when he went to Heaven. Again that
                    reinforced the affection the Costa Ricans had for our President.</p>
                <p>I am a Catholic, but I have never attended so many funeral Masses in my life. At
                    one point, I went, representing the Embassy, to several Masses a day. There were
                    only two practicing Catholic families in the Embassy, Ambassador Telles' family
                    and the Blakes. At first, the Ambassador regarded it as his duty to attend all
                    Masses in President Kennedy's honor, but, after a time, he said, “I just can't
                    go to all these Masses, Mel. You have to help out.” So, for about 30 days, we
                    went to a lot of Masses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Costa Rica heavily involved in the Alliance for
                        Progress?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>BLAKE: Costa Rica was a great supporter of the Alliance for Progress, and, yes,
                    it was heavily involved. Costa Rica, I discovered, had defaulted on a number of
                    loans before I got there. When I tried talking to the Costa Ricans about it,
                    they would point out what great friends they were of the United States, and how,
                    actually, the Costa Rican parliament had declared war on the axis (Germany,
                    Italy and Japan) in December 1941 before the U.S. did. They rushed in on
                    December 8. The Costa Ricans would say, “You interned the Japanese...we interned
                    not only the Japanese but also the Germans.” Actually, there were very few if
                    any Japanese in Costa Rica. The Costa Ricans held the Germans in internment
                    camps until the end of the War. Pepe Figueres was a young man in the early 1940s
                    and began to accumulate a fortune by selling German food specialties to the
                    interned Germans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, when you were chief of the economic section, did
                        yohave an AID mission there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: We had a rather substantial AID mission. After I had been in Costa Rica
                    for two years, the AID mission director asked me if I wanted to be the Program
                    Officer for the AID mission as well as Chief of the Economic Section. The
                    Ambassador was in favor of it, as was the DCM. The AID people back in Washington
                    turned it down on the grounds that they wanted the program officer job to go to
                    an AID officer as a means of developing skills on the part of their own service.
                    I was there for a three-year tour, but the Department was amenable to cutting it
                    back to a two-year tour. The officer in charge of assignments for mid-career
                    economic officers advised me that I had outgrown the job and should be
                    transferred.</p>
                <p>It would have made great sense to achieve at least a partial integration of the
                    AID mission and the Economic Section. The better part of my work was in support
                    of development assistance. The Ambassador, the AID mission director, and I
                    worked closely together on development assistance and worked at the highest
                    levels in the Costa Rican Government. To illustrate, one afternoon, about 4:30,
                    the Ambassador asked me how many times that day we had met with Costa Rican
                    President Orlich. I thought a moment and realized that we had been with the
                    President five times that day. Such frequent meetings would never occur in
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Telles had extremely close relations with the Costa Rican leaders. He
                    arrived in Costa Rica in 1961 just after Orlich had been inaugurated. Orlich's
                    party had been in the opposition during the previous administration, and he and
                    his party believed that the U.S. Government had been too close to the
                    predecessor conservative government. Telles told me that he received a rather
                    cool welcome and thought that he had to do something dramatic to break the ice.
                    Shortly after he took charge of the Embassy, he asked Orlich whether he could
                    have a private line installed in his office that would connect directly to the
                    President's office. A sort of hot line that no one else could touch. If the
                    President wanted to speak to the Ambassador confidentially, it would be there.
                    Orlich was dubious but accepted the telephone line, and Telles said that it
                    didn't ring for over a year. Then one day it rang, and the ice was broken.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How big a section did you have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: In addition to myself, I had an economic officer, a commercial officer, an
                    American secretary, and three local employees. I thought it was time to go on. I
                    was rather hopeful of getting another overseas assignment. In fact, the one I
                    was rather keen to get was Chief of the Economic Section in Bolivia. It seemed
                    like a nice challenge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is high up enough I guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: The Department decided to return me to Washington. Anthony Solomon had
                    come in as Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs and had expressed
                    great dissatisfaction with the staff in the Bureau. Tony felt that
                    Wristonization had left the Bureau with a lot of has-beens. A lot of the people
                    coming in to the Economics Bureau did not meet his expectations. So, the
                    Department drew up a list of about 35 or 40 mid-career and senior officers who
                    were coming up for re-assignment in the next six months or so. My name was on
                    that list. We were described as some of the best economic officers of our ranks.
                    Tony was given first shot at us before any other Bureau. In late 1965, I was
                    transferred back to Washington to the Economic Bureau's tropical products
                    division to be in charge of sugar import policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There is high politics involved there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: The United States had a schedule of country quotas on imported sugar. The
                    quotas were designed to protect domestic growers of sugar cane and beets and to
                    protect sugar refineries by keeping the domestic price for sugar artificially
                    high, albeit consistent with prices for other agricultural commodities. The
                    quota system was heavily controlled by the Agriculture Department to protect the
                    domestic sugar interests. As it happened, the United States not only needed all
                    of the sugar quota, but we also needed so much sugar for our food and beverage
                    industries at that time that we were going outside the quota system to get
                    sugar. So, the sugar policy officer had absolutely nothing to do. I reported in
                    January 1966 and for several months occupied myself with soluble coffee and some
                    other things that had fallen between the stools, for example, spice.</p>

                <p>BLAKE: Yes, but in the Spring of 1966, I was asked to go on coconegotiations. We
                    went off on that about late April or May.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were they held?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: The negotiations were held under United Nations auspices at the UN
                    building in New York City. U.S. cocoa policy was very tightly controlled by the
                    industry. We had a very restrictive policy. We had five industry observers to
                    the delegation, including one from Hershey, one who represented the cocoa
                    finishers, one representing the commodity import trade, and two who represented
                    something else. Once, I asked an industry observer what amount of the total U.S.
                    cocoa trade they represented. He said, “Eighty-five percent of all the chocolate
                    trade in the United States.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By restrictive, what do you mean, cutting down imports
                        or...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: Perhaps restrictive is the wrong word. We wanted more open trade in cocoa
                    and the elimination of buffer stocks as a support for cocoa producers. The
                    international cocoa agreement, which was the subject of the negotiations,
                    divided the signatory parties into two groups - consuming nations and producing
                    nations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But we are always in favor of open trade.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: The cocoa agreement was intended to balance the interest of consumers and
                    producers by assuring that an adequate level of cocoa would be put on the world
                    market at stable prices. The producer countries didn't like the booms and busts
                    caused by climatic conditions, and a stabilization fund was supposed to provide
                    cocoa reserves that could be put on the market when necessary. Also, the
                    stabilization fund was supposed to buy cocoa when there was a glut.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The fluctuating.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: Yes, the producers didn't like price fluctuations, and they wanted
                    stabilization to be achieved by sales through a buffer stock. Well, the United
                    States was against the buffer stock. Our position and our negotiating tactics
                    made it appear that we were in favor of gluts, which would depress cocoa prices,
                    and that we were not concerned about the potential scarcity. No other consuming
                    country (France, Germany, or the United Kingdom, for example) supported the U.S.
                    position.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>The cocoa negotiations became so embarrassing that Ambassador Arthur Goldberg,
                    our Permanent Representative to the United Nations, called in the head of the
                    delegation, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Ed Freed. He told Ed that the
                    delegation was having an adverse effect on our relations with a number of
                    important developing countries. Ed replied, “Yes, but I have got my orders, and
                    here we are.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The order came from the Department or Agriculture or
                        where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: The U.S. position had been approved by an inter-agency committee. The U.S.
                    position was dominated by Department of Commerce and industry interests.
                    Agriculture had little influence on the U.S. position, as that Agency
                    predominantly reflects the interests of domestic U.S. agricultural producers. We
                    had a Commerce officer on the delegation but no Agriculture officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: When Ambassador Goldberg didn't get satisfaction from Freed, he had Tony
                    Solomon come up. Tony called us all in and dressed us down and said, “For God's
                    sake at least try to say no with a smile on your face. Be pleasant about saying
                    'No.'" The result was that the cocoa negotiations ended in a shambles.
                    Governments agreed to meet again in six or eight months, and we all went back to
                    our respective capitals, us feeling somewhat discouraged because we knew the
                    United States had caused the negotiations to fail so miserably that we couldn't
                    even raise matters which were of concern to our industry. I think we all
                    realized we were taking extreme positions, but our instructions provided no
                    leeway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we alone in this? The British, Germans, and Swiss
                        didn'stand...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: Yes, absolutely alone. The Head of the Tropical Products Division, a
                    fellow named Paul Callahan, was fond of saying, “Those dastardly Brits. They let
                    us do the dirty work for them, but they are pleased that we are doing it. The
                    Swiss are pleased we are doing it.” I'm not sure it really worked out that way.
                    The experience, nevertheless, showed the power and influence of industry on
                    foreign policy.</p>
                <p>We returned to Washington in June. I had been promoted, and there was no suitable
                    position for me in the Economics Bureau. Ree Shannon, the personnel officer in
                    the European Bureau, asked the Economics Bureau to release me, as she needed an
                    economics officer. In August, I went in as Economic Advisor to Wells Stabler,
                    who was the country director for Austria, Italy, and Switzerland in the European
                    Bureau, and worked there for the next 30 months.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the issues you faced there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: There were a range of trade issues and the sort of things that all the
                    desk officers do. The principal negotiation was to amend the civil aviation
                    agreement between Italy and the United States. Apparently, the negotiations had
                    been going on for many years, and, every year, we'd go off to Italy for about
                    six weeks for these negotiations, which never got anywhere. The reason was that
                    the industry advisers - they came from PanAm and TWA - to the U.S. Government
                    were satisfied with the then-existing agreement and were confident that Italy
                    would not denounce it if it was not amended. To illustrate our intransigence, at
                    one point, we were prepared to give the Italians landing rights at Atlanta,
                    which the industry advisers regarded as a ludicrous international terminus, that
                    is, it was in the 1960s. Then, TWA learned that Al Italia had done a market
                    survey of the U.S. civil air market and had determined that Atlanta had the
                    greatest growth potential of any airport in the United States. When we learned
                    this, we quashed plans to give the Italians landing rights in Atlanta even
                    though PanAm and TWA had no plans to serve that point.</p>
                <p>Frank Loy, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for transportation and
                    communications, showed greater finesse at saying “no” than had Ed Fried. The
                    Italians used to say that the culprits were the Italian-Americans on the U.S.
                    delegation, primarily from the Civil Aeronautics Board, who, according to the
                    Italians, used our annual trips to Rome to visit their relatives in Italy. Italy
                    attached such importance to the negotiations that it assigned its former
                    Ambassador to Sweden to only one task: to negotiate a civil aviation agreement
                    with the United States. That was a major activity for two years. We did,
                    nevertheless, amend the agreement in 1968. Then, I began work on negotiations to
                    amend the civil air agreement with Austria.In June 1968, Frank Weil, the
                    training officer in the Office of Personnel, advised me that I had been selected
                    for advanced training at the NATO Defense College in Rome, Italy. I said, “Well,
                    geeze, I am not so sure I want that. I had rather hoped for the National Defense
                    University.” He said, “Well, the way it has worked out this year, you are going
                    to Rome. If you turn this one down, you will be assigned to advanced training
                    again next year, and you might get what you want or you might get something even
                    less interesting to you than Rome.” I replied, “Let me talk to Rozanne. After
                    dinner that evening, I said, “Rozanne, I got this call from Personnel. They want
                    me to go off for advanced training. I'm not sure I want to go. I don't think the
                    school is of sufficient stature. She said, “What is it?” I said, “The NATO
                    Defense College.” She said, “Where is it?” I said, “It is in Rome.” She reached
                    out and picked up about four or five bills, handed them to me, and said, “You
                    mean we could get out of Washington for Rome, and you are thinking of turning it
                    down? Have you taken leave of your senses?”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your mind was changed immediately.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>BLAKE: I said, “Well, now that you have put it that way.” The nexmorning, I
                    called and said, “Sure, I'll go to Rome.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is what, a six-month course over there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: A six-month course, and we went at the beginning of January 1969. However,
                    there was a rather interesting development in August of 1968. Anyone who could
                    get away, including Wells, was on vacation. The Swiss Ambassador, Felix
                    Schnyder, said he would like to present a note. I received him, and he gave me a
                    note requesting that the United States negotiate a treaty of judicial
                    assistance, a so-called bank secrecy agreement, under which we would be
                    permitted to receive material from Swiss banks and their confidential records,
                    and they would have the same right with U.S. banks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very important.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: I remember receiving the note and saying we would certainly give it every
                    consideration we could. I think it was on a Friday. Wells was back on Monday,
                    and I presented it to him. We realized it was a very interesting opportunity and
                    sent it up to the Secretary. It was decided that we should find out how serious
                    the Swiss were by sending Nicholas Katzenbach, the Deputy Attorney General, to
                    Switzerland to talk to the Swiss government, the American Embassy officials, and
                    representatives from Swiss banks. Now, at that time, this is the late '60s,
                    somebody had written a book called The Gnomes of Zurich. There was great
                    pressure to open Swiss bank accounts. Henry Morgenthau, District Attorney for
                    the Southern District of New York, was putting a great deal of pressure on the
                    Swiss. They were also getting bad press, which they considered harmful to their
                    trade and tourist relations with the United States. The Deputy Attorney General
                    came back and said, “These folks are serious. They do want to negotiate a
                    treaty.” So, I prepared a note, which was sent to the Swiss Embassy, agreeing to
                    undertake the negotiations.</p>
                <p>For the record, I should note that the Swiss Government had made a similar
                    proposal to the U.S. Government in the late 1930s, but President Franklin
                    Roosevelt was so preoccupied with the impending war in Europe that the U.S.
                    Government never took up the Swiss offer.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>I went off to the NATO Defense College, just outside Rome, Italy, in January
                    1969. The NATO Defense College has the so-called North American tour. I came
                    back to the Department on that tour, I think it was late March, saw Wells, and
                    said, “When you speak to personnel, I still don't have an assignment.” He said,
                    “Oh, yes, you really do have one. You just probably haven't heard that you are
                    being assigned as Economic Counselor at Bern.” I remonstrated, “Geeze, I am at
                    the NATO Defense College, and you are sending me to a neutral country.” He said,
                    “I absolutely insist on it. I want you there. Over the years, you have developed
                    a number of friends in Treasury. They also want you there. What we'd like for
                    you to do is be the combined Economic Counselor and Treasury Representative. It
                    would be two-hatted.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is very unusual. Treasury doesn't very often put that
                        on State Department officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: That's right. I decided, reluctantly, to go - reluctant for several
                    reasons. First, with five children, two or probably three of them would have to
                    go to boarding school. Second, I knew that Switzerland was very high cost, and,
                    third, I thought I might rather have something a bit more varied. I guess, too,
                    having been on the Swiss desk already, I was looking for change. On the other
                    hand, how can one quarrel with an assignment to Switzerland?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: People don't fight assignments to Switzerland.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: And, off we went, for four very pleasant years. I worked with Shelby
                    Cullom Davis, a political appointee who was a Wall Street investment banker. I
                    had some trepidation when I read in Who's Who that both Ambassador Davis and his
                    wife were Ph.D.s from a Geneva university. I thought, “He is going to know an
                    awful lot about Switzerland. It is going to be tough.” In fact, he was one of
                    the finest people I have ever worked with, and one of the best ambassadors I
                    have ever known.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how big was your section there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: Before I came, the Treasury Officer was in Zurich.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No Commercial Officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: The Commercial Office was separate. Its staff consisted of the commercial
                    officer, a deputy commercial officer, and two or perhaps three local employees.
                    I found that odd. I didn't see how you could separate commercial work from the
                    overall economic area. I was really unaccustomed to that, but this had been the
                    historical staffing arrangement at Bern.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>I have already mentioned that the Swiss Ambassador had left a note in August
                    1968, on the negotiation of a judicial assistance treaty. Then, it took several
                    months to set things up. As it happened, by the time I got to Switzerland in
                    August 1969, they were ready to begin the negotiations on the treaty. That was
                    the most important embassy activity for the next four years. So much so, I
                    became so very heavily engaged with the banks that Dick Vine, the Deputy Chief
                    of Mission, later told me that he felt it would be best not to combine the
                    Economic and Commercial Sections but to leave them separated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get into any question of selling U.S. defense
                        equipmento the Swiss?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: That was probably the major activity of the Defense Attach� Station. At
                    that time, we were interested in selling an aircraft to them, so the Air Attach�
                    was very important. Under the U.S. military system, the Principal Defense
                    Attach� is designated back in Washington. For reasons of inter-service
                    negotiations as much as anything, Switzerland was regarded as an army post, so
                    the Defense Attach� was army. But, the only military activity in the country was
                    on the Air Force side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the assistant attach� an Air Force Officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: He was an Air Force Colonel.</p>

                <p>BLAKE: Yes, the Economic Section got involved peripherally in these negotiations,
                    because I had close relations with the head of the Swiss Air Office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any problems with the fact that the Swiss were our
                        protectinpower in Cuba? Did that cause you any difficulty?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: No, not at all. That was the only work of any consequence that the
                    political officer did. The Political Section consisted of one officer. He didn't
                    even have a secretary. Domestic political affairs in Switzerland were really not
                    very important in U.S.-Swiss relations, but protecting our interests in Cuba was
                    quite important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did your duties as treasury representative consist
                        of?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>BLAKE: The dollar was deteriorating at that time, and we had the fixed exchange
                    rate system, so there was a great deal of activity with the banks. I would be
                    away from Bern a week to 10 days out of each month, either in Geneva or Zurich,
                    but principally in Zurich. I would go to Zurich at least a week a month, then
                    Basel or Geneva three days a month. I had very close ties with the central bank,
                    Swiss National Bank, but also with the three Grosse Banken and with the more
                    important private banks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, those sound like happy years in Switzerland.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: Oh, they were very happy years. Perhaps, the most interesting thing there
                    was the negotiations on the judicial assistance treaty. The backstopping team in
                    Washington consisted of the State Department as the lead Agency, Treasury, the
                    Criminal Division of the Department of Justice, and the Securities and Exchange
                    Commission. From Treasury, came two sides, one was the General Counsel's office
                    and the other side was the Office of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF). The
                    Assistant Secretary for ATF also was responsible for the Secret Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that finally concluded during your tour in Bern?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: The negotiations went along in a rather desultory fashion for a couple of
                    years. The main problem was to define a crime to which the treaty would apply.
                    Then, the United States proposed that the annex of crimes covered by the Swiss
                    Criminal Code be attached to the treaty and used to define crimes covered by the
                    treaty. Then we had a viable negotiation. There were certain other minor
                    technical aspects, and they could have gone on for years, but we were over the
                    major hurdle. There were still some minor definitional problems, and, to a
                    certain extent, negotiations on the judicial assistance treaty became
                    intertwined with negotiations on the avoidance of double taxation. In time,
                    however, these issues could be separated.</p>
                <p>About March of 1972, the Ambassador went back to Washington. He went on his
                    rounds of consultation, and among the people he saw was his old friend John
                    Mitchell who was Attorney General. Upon the Ambassador's return to Bern, he
                    called me in and said, “Mel, I saw John.” I knew whom he meant. “He tells me
                    that my highest priority here is to complete the negotiations on a judicial
                    assistance treaty. It is very important for the re-election of President Nixon.”
                    At that time, it seemed clear McGovern was going to be the Democratic candidate.
                    It was equally clear who was going to win. I thought, “My God, this Republican
                    administration takes nothing for granted.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I couldn't quite figure that one out when you mentioned
                        it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>BLAKE: In any event, the Ambassador said, “I want you to draw up a plan to obtain
                    Swiss agreement to the treaty so that the President can cite it as an
                    accomplishment.” I went back to my office, thought about it, and began writing a
                    memorandum.</p>
                <p>Now, Switzerland is a country that runs on the basis of consensus. No Swiss
                    government will agree to anything unless all the parties are on board. The
                    Government doesn't like fighting with any segment of the economy. Once, Swiss
                    President Celio introduced a rather inconsequential bill in Parliament. It was
                    rejected by the Parliament, and he resigned on the ground that he had failed to
                    consult adequately with all interested parties. The Parliament was very upset
                    about it. They all rushed around and reached a compromise, and then the
                    President withdrew his letter of resignation, and they enacted the bill. It just
                    shows how strong this need of getting everybody on board is for the Swiss. This
                    had happened just before I had to write my memorandum.</p>
                <p>In the memorandum, I noted that Switzerland runs on consensus, and the way to
                    assure that the treaty would pass the Swiss Parliament was to make sure that all
                    of the banks were on board. I attached a list of all of the members of the
                    boards of directors of the five most important banks in the country, many of
                    whom were industrialists or prominent in various professions, plus the principal
                    owners of the more important private banks. I recommended that the Ambassador
                    explain what was involved in the treaty to all of these people. If we got their
                    assent, or at least willingness not to oppose the treaty, I reasoned that the
                    Swiss Government would approve it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That we, the Americans, explain rather than their own
                        government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: That's right. The Ambassador read the memo and said, “I am tempted to do
                    this but what about the Swiss government? Shouldn't they do this?” I replied
                    that I would confirm that we could do it by talking to my counterpart on the
                    Swiss side, a fellow named Pierre Nussbaumer in the Foreign Office. I went to
                    Pierre and said, “How can we move the treaty?” He said, “Mel, we are at our wits
                    end. The banks are just dragging their feet. People don't like change.” I said,
                    “What would you say if we talked to the bankers? After all, you know the
                    Ambassador, and you know how well known he is in the community.” He said, “Oh,
                    yes. Indeed, we would be delighted if you would do this.” So I told the
                    Ambassador of my conversation with Pierre.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>The Ambassador then got in touch with an old friend Robert Lutz, who was the head
                    of Credit Suisse. (Lutz had been head of Credit Suisse in New York. His son,
                    Robert Lutz, Jr., was head of the International Division of Ford Motor Company
                    and later became Ford's President.) The Ambassador and I met with Lutz. The
                    Ambassador said, “Bob, the negotiations on bank secrecy have gone on for three
                    years. Actually, they began with a note your Ambassador left with the State
                    Department in 1968. Do you think your friends and colleagues would object if I
                    meet with them and explain what this agreement is all about and what we are
                    trying to accomplish under safeguards?” Bob replied, “Some people would probably
                    take offense, but they don't count. What you are doing is the sort of thing an
                    ambassador ought to be doing, and that is informing us and giving us your
                    government's views. Do go ahead.”</p>
                <p>When we got back to the Embassy, the Ambassador said, “ I want you to set up
                    lunch or dinner with everyone on this list. For reasons of economy, let's make
                    about five or six to a group.” Over the next several months, we had lunch or
                    dinner with every single member of the boards of directors of these major banks
                    plus the leading personalities in the more important private banks. The
                    procedure was to have a pleasant meal. Then, when coffee was served, the
                    Ambassador would make some introductory comments and then ask me to explain the
                    treaty's main provisions. After 20 minutes or so, he would close with a
                    question-and-answer period. The questions were very substantive, although there
                    were several guests who seemed irritated. They felt they were being taken
                    advantage of. But, the result at the end of all of this was evident when Bob
                    Lutz got back in touch with the Ambassador and said, “I can assure you that
                    Swiss banks will pose no objection to the judicial assistance treaty, and they
                    have asked me to notify the Swiss Government.</p>
                <p>Although we signed the treaty after the November 1972 U.S. elections, the
                    Ambassador was able to tell John Mitchell that the Swiss were on board, and the
                    Administration could rest assured that the Treaty would be signed in 1973.We set
                    the final round of negotiations in the Spring of 1973 in Bern. Perhaps to show
                    their banks and their Parliament that they were making every effort to protect
                    Swiss interests, the Swiss Government designated Ambassador Albert Weitnauer,
                    one of their most senior and influential negotiators, to head the Swiss
                    delegation. Our side was headed by a senior mid-level officer of serious mien,
                    and we met for two days of negotiating comedy. Rather ponderously, our
                    delegation head began to review the treaty, article by article and paragraph by
                    paragraph. To Weitnauer, it was a done deal. He wanted enough show to
                    demonstrate that he had been a purposeful negotiator who had stood up for Swiss
                    interests, but he did not want the risk that such a detailed examination might
                    flush some difficulty that had escaped everyone's notice. Keeping the
                    negotiations smoothly on track was his objective.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>Toward the end of the first day, Weitnauer leaned across the table and gently
                    suggested that he be asked a certain question. Then, he answered it and wrote
                    the exchange on his note pad. Then, Weitnauer asked another question, etc.
                    Occasionally, he would break the monotony by asking a question and guiding the
                    answer. Toward the end of the second day, Ambassador Weitnauer closed his note
                    pad and announced that the negotiations had come to a successful conclusion. We
                    shook hands all around and basked in the pleasure of a job well done.</p>
                <p>To indicate the importance the United States attached to the agreement, Assistant
                    Secretary of State Walter Stoessel came to Bern in June of 1973 to sign it.</p>
                <p>This was the first bank secrecy treaty the United States ever entered into and
                    the first ever signed by a country based on an Anglo-Saxon legal system with a
                    country that had a judicial system based on continental law. It established a
                    precedent for the United States. Nevertheless, in August 1975, as I was
                    preparing to leave Washington on assignment to Frankfurt, Germany, I was asked
                    to meet with representatives of the State and Justice Departments. The Swiss
                    Parliament had approved the Treaty in 1974, and the Swiss government was
                    awaiting action by the Senate so that deposit of the instruments of ratification
                    could be arranged. At the meeting, I was told that the U.S. government had
                    decided that the Treaty was not as far reaching as we would like, and I was
                    asked whether it would be feasible to ask the Swiss Government to renegotiate
                    the Treaty with the object of increasing the number of criminal offenses to be
                    covered by it. In other words, to expand on the annex which was based on the
                    Swiss Criminal Code.</p>
                <p>By that time, Ambassador Davis had left Switzerland. I doubted that the
                    Ambassador who followed him would have the same influence with the Swiss
                    government and the Swiss banks. It was certain that Switzerland would be
                    offended if we rejected a treaty that had been given such careful consideration.
                    Hence, I said that we had been fortunate to reach agreement on the U.S.-Swiss
                    Treaty in 1973 and should send it to the Senate as soon as possible, reserving
                    our concerns for expanded coverage for future negotiations with Switzerland and
                    other countries. This suggestion was accepted, and it is my recollection that
                    the Treaty was sent to the Senate and ratified in 1976.</p>
                <p>As I have said, the Ambassador was a gracious and focused host. He used working
                    luncheons in his extensive travels around the country. Invitations to dinners at
                    the residence with Mrs. Davis were prized. It was diplomatic entertaining that
                    you no longer see, and it was widely and favorably commented upon in the local
                    community. Once, however, this reputation could have produced perverse
                    results.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>You may recall the Investors Overseas Service (IOS), which was founded in the
                    late 1950s or early '60s by Bernie Kornfeld. IOS was a sort of investment fund
                    with incorporation or administrative dodges that took advantage of tax and other
                    loopholes throughout Europe. The IOS charter was Canadian; its headquarters were
                    in Geneva. Many of the tax dodges were based on Luxembourg law. Customers were
                    primarily American servicemen or businessmen living abroad. It grew phenomenally
                    with assets in the billions; it was so large that there was concern that, if the
                    IOS bubble burst, it could hurt Wall Street.</p>
                <p>The U.S. Government took a cautious approach toward IOS. Although IOS was not an
                    American corporation, its portfolio consisted mainly of American securities, and
                    it presented itself as an American fund. Kornfeld had hired James Roosevelt, the
                    son of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, in 1970 to shore up the company's
                    faltering image. I had met Roosevelt during the ill-fated cocoa negotiations
                    when he was a Deputy to Arthur Goldberg at the U.S. Mission to the United
                    Nations, and I renewed contact when he reported in to IOS at Geneva. Shortly
                    thereafter, IOS got into serious trouble, and was taken over by Robert Vesco, a
                    New Jersey welder who somehow got into investments and was rather successful.
                    Vesco came to Geneva and said that he was going to turn IOS around. It was a
                    high-wire act with a great deal of publicity, and the financial community
                    closely followed every announcement.</p>
                <p>One morning, Roosevelt telephoned me at Bern to say that Vesco urgently wanted to
                    meet with the Ambassador regarding IOS. I told the Ambassador that we had no
                    legal responsibility toward IOS but there was a real need to know what Vesco
                    might be up to in light of the effect that developments at IOS could have on the
                    stock market. It was a Hobson's choice, but I thought that the lesser of two
                    evils would be to hear Vesco out. The Ambassador agreed, and Roosevelt said they
                    would arrive about noon.</p>
                <p>Vesco and Roosevelt were accompanied by two fellows who, to put it mildly, would
                    not have made it at the Wharton School of Finance. Vesco was of medium stature,
                    stocky, and struck me as a strong-arm man rather than a con artist. He got to
                    his point immediately. He said that Kornfeld had (expletive deleted) up at IOS,
                    but he was going to straighten it out. His problem was that the press was giving
                    him a hard time, and the Swiss were beginning to look over his shoulder a bit
                    too closely. He needed the opportunity to explain his plan for IOS to top Swiss
                    government officials and bankers, as well as the press in the most favorable
                    setting. He knew that the Ambassador knew everyone of consequence in Switzerland
                    and was held in high esteem. Hence, Vesco proposed that the Ambassador rent one
                    of the larger restaurants (the Kornhaus Keller) for an evening and invite the
                    top layers of the Swiss Government and banks. After dinner, the Ambassador
                    should introduce Vesco, and he would take it from there. Seeing the startled
                    look on the Ambassador's face at such audacity, Vesco said, “Don't worry about
                    cost. I'll pay for everything.”</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>At this, the Ambassador turned to me and asked, “What do you think?” I replied
                    that the U.S. Government recognized the difficult situation IOS was in, the
                    importance to Wall Street and the world financial community of helping IOS out
                    of its difficulties, which I was sure could be overcome. But, I continued,
                    “Unfortunately, there was no legal or diplomatic basis for U.S. help to IOS, as
                    it was a Canadian corporation.” I added that the Canadian Ambassador was a
                    friend of the American Embassy and expressed confidence that Ambassador Davis
                    would not object to introducing Vesco to him. The Ambassador added that he would
                    be delighted to do so. Vesco glared at me, stood up, uttered a curt good-bye,
                    and stalked out. We never heard from him or Roosevelt again.</p>
                <p>I find the Swiss a very attractive people to do business with. Now and then, I
                    might have found them a bit officious had I not approached them through many
                    years of negotiations with the Italians on our civil air agreement, and had I
                    not lived in Rome in a period when one day all the gasoline stations would be on
                    strike; the next day all the metro and public transportation people would be on
                    strike. At no time, were the garbage collectors in Rome ever off strike. It was
                    really quite comforting and pleasant to be assigned in Switzerland, but the
                    things that made it pleasant were the Swiss people themselves, their integrity,
                    and their businesslike approach.</p>
                <p>I want to recount three instances that illustrate the Swiss integrity,
                    thoroughness and courtesy. When I joined the staff of the Office of Austrian,
                    Italian, and Swiss Affairs in August 1966, the first matter I had to deal with
                    was a demarche by Klaus Jacobi, the Swiss Embassy's Economic Counselor. (Klaus
                    was later Swiss Ambassador to Washington.) He advised that the Swiss Government
                    was changing its domestic subsidy program for hog producers. As a result Swiss
                    lard would become cheaper and lard imports would be disadvantaged. As the United
                    States had sold 12 tons of lard to Switzerland in the last year for which they
                    had data, the Swiss felt obliged to inform us and to ask whether the United
                    States had a problem. Klaus added that the first trade agreement signed by the
                    United States under the Trade Agreements Act of 1934 was with Switzerland. I
                    contacted the Department of Commerce since lard is a processed agricultural
                    product. Both the country specialist and the “lard” specialist were bemused that
                    the Swiss would trouble themselves with 12 tons of lard. They couldn't even find
                    data that we had sold lard to Switzerland and, in the end, I was authorized to
                    tell the Swiss that the United States had no objection to their proposed subsidy
                    program.</p>
                <p>Paul Jolles, the Head of the Swiss Trade Office, was probably the leading
                    official in the country. I saw him from time to time. Once, I had a 9:30
                    appointment with him. I was about to leave the Embassy for his office, when the
                    phone rang and his secretary said that the Ambassador would not be able to see
                    me until 9:35. When I got to his office, the Ambassador said, “I thought that
                    you would rather spend that five minutes in your office than in my anteroom.” I
                    love that punctuality.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>With the Swiss you can get right to the point. I would like to illustrate that by
                    my experiences on the negotiation of amendments to the U.S.-Swiss air transport
                    agreement. The U.S. team came over from Washington to negotiate changes in our
                    air transport agreement. It was a very pleasant July. Two of the members of the
                    team had arranged that their wives would join them for the last two weeks of the
                    projected four-week negotiation. We met with Werner Guldimann, the head of the
                    Swissair office, which was a combination of FAA, CAB, and any operation in State
                    that had to deal with civil aviation. We had a team from the CAB, the State
                    Department desk, the State Department Office of Aviation, and an industry
                    adviser.On the first afternoon of negotiations, Werner Guldimann made his
                    presentation for the Swiss; he was their entire team. Then the head of the
                    American team made his presentation. All those in the American side chimed in
                    with several questions. After two hours had elapsed, the American said that,
                    having just flown over, they were feeling a bit jet-lagged, and they asked to
                    recess for the day. Werner said that would be fine.</p>
                <p>As the team was leaving, Werner asked me to stay behind, which I did. He said,
                    “Mel, this is terrible.” I said, “What is terrible?” He said, “The pace. We will
                    be forever negotiating this. I just don't have this much time. I can't tie
                    myself up like this. What can we do to move the negotiations along?” I said, “I
                    will talk to my people and see what we can do.” He said, “No, tell me what do
                    you really want out of this agreement.” I said, “Well, what we would really like
                    is...” and I spelled it out for him. He said, “I can live with that. Now, I will
                    tell you what I want.” He told me, and it was essentially less than we were
                    prepared to give them. I said, “We can live with that.” He said, “Fine, we have
                    a deal.”</p>
                <p>The U.S. delegation was waiting for me in the street, and the delegation Head
                    said, “What happened, Mel? Was he mad?” I replied that I would explain at the
                    Embassy. At the Embassy, I said he just wanted to know what we wanted. “That's
                    it? You didn't tell him, did you?” I said, “Well yes, I did. And, he said he
                    accepts it. Then, he told me what they want.” As I explained it, they recognized
                    it was less than they were prepared to offer and we were getting a good deal. I
                    have never seen such disappointed people. They returned to Washington two days
                    later. We had a deal that worked out very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a nice vignette. Well, what happened after you
                        lefBern? You came back to Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: Yes. As I was preparing to leave Bern, the Department contacted me on an
                    assignment to the Embassy at Vienna as Economic Counselor. With the exception of
                    two years in Costa Rica, all of my assignments had been in Europe or on European
                    matters, including two training tours in Europe. It seemed to me that was
                    terribly parochial. Apart from that, the inspectors had been through Bern and
                    had said that it would hurt my career to have another European assignment. So, I
                    turned down Austria and came back, unassigned, to the Department.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>When I got back, I was interviewed by John Hurd, Ambassador to South Africa, who
                    wanted me as Economic Counselor, but asked that I wait until an assignment was
                    found for the current Counselor. The European Bureau asked me to take six months
                    training in Finnish and then go to Helsinki as Economic Counselor. That was in
                    August, and I had three children in junior high and high school. Helsinki struck
                    me as less promising than Pretoria. In either event, I would have had to uproot
                    three children in the middle of the school year.</p>
                <p>While I was weighing these alternatives, the Office of International Affairs in
                    the Treasury Department contacted the State Department. They wanted someone who
                    knew international banking and believed they had no one with that sort of
                    background. The activities of foreign banks in the United States were becoming a
                    political issue and certainly were an economic factor. Treasury wondered if they
                    could borrow me from the State Department to handle international banking and
                    other international financial affairs. That would be for a one-year tour. I took
                    that assignment. As it turned out, I enjoyed the Treasury Department immensely
                    and stayed for two years.</p>
                <p>My principal responsibilities concerned international banking and foreign bank
                    activity in the United States. The U.S. Government was developing legislation,
                    for the first time, to control foreign banks. This required changes in domestic
                    banking law and practice, as well. It was completely new territory for banking
                    regulation, and Deputy Secretary Steve Gardiner and Under Secretary Paul Volcker
                    were heavily involved. Apart from the Federal Government, State banking
                    regulators were also involved. Under the Glass- Steagal Act, interstate banking
                    was denied to American banks, but foreign banks could establish branches in more
                    than one state and, in effect, engage in interstate banking. Robert Albright,
                    the Superintendent for Banking in New York State came up with the novel concept
                    that contiguous states might enter reciprocal agreements on interstate banking.
                    Volcker favored this approach, but Gardner, who had come from a Philadelphia
                    regional bank, was more reserved. At the private level, the American Banking
                    Association, which has a number of regional and smaller banks as members, was
                    opposed to interstate banking and wanted a rollback on foreign bank activity
                    here. The association of the major international banks - I forget its name -
                    favored giving foreign banks the same opportunities that their governments gave
                    U.S. banks in the sending country, in other words, international
                    reciprocity.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>A related issue was foreign investment in the United States. This was the time
                    when crude oil prices had risen dramatically; gasoline prices were high, and we
                    had gas rationing; and the dollar was weak. There was considerable resentment
                    against foreigners, primarily Japanese and people from the Middle East, who were
                    buying up U.S. assets. Middle Eastern interests were in the process of buying
                    Kiwah Island, off the coast of South Carolina. This purchase evoked a great deal
                    of xenophobic publicity, for example, that we were at risk of having a foreign
                    flag flying over American soil. The fellow who was sweating it out was the
                    American owner of Kiwah Island. As I recall, he had bought it for $100,000 and
                    was selling for $30 million. One day, there were five different Congressional
                    committees holding hearings on the threat presumably posed by foreign investment
                    in the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were you received at Treasury?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: Extremely well. I was in the Office of International Affairs, which has a
                    highly competent, highly trained staff. It is the sort of place where all of the
                    economists had advanced degrees and were very competent, very discreet in
                    performing their duties.This office has an interesting background. It was formed
                    to manage the moneys we acquired by going on the gold standard in 1933. We
                    valued gold at $35 per fine ounce, which created a cache of money for the
                    Treasury Department. They needed people to administer that money and set up the
                    Office of International Affairs. By the end of the Second World War, it was
                    becoming a rather interesting responsibility, but it required more day-to-day
                    operations than Treasury liked. Treasury representatives at American embassies
                    report back to this Office. Treasury wanted to be able to concentrate on broad
                    policy issues. In the late 1940s, the Secretary of Treasury got in touch with
                    the Secretary of State, as I was told by Henry Tasca. By the way, Henry Tasca
                    had been a Treasury representative before he came in to the Foreign Service.
                    Treasury got in touch with the State Department and said they would like to pass
                    the Office of International Affairs and responsibility for these monetary assets
                    to State. State thought about it for a time, and then the Secretary of State
                    sent a message back that economic affairs had no place in diplomacy, and he
                    rejected the offer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Real forward-thinking.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: By rejecting that, he rejected the opportunity to get a very competent
                    staff and a toehold in what is now one of the leading areas of international
                    economic activity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might just comment that I dealt with a number of
                        Treasury attaches in my service overseas, and I found all of them, without
                        exception, to be first class people, absolutely very good in their
                        jobs.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>BLAKE: Very good. There was something I felt when I reverted to State or even
                    while I was at Treasury. Foreign Service officers have always felt that the
                    Treasury attach�s were holding something back from them, that they weren't
                    really part of the team at an embassy. But, having been a Treasury
                    representative abroad, and having worked in treasury backstopping Treasury
                    representatives and that sort of thing, I can assure you there was nothing of
                    that sort. The Treasury people simply did their work so competently, so
                    unobtrusively, that there is a tendency to think they are holding something
                    back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have contacts with the Department frequently, or
                        did yowork mainly up through the Treasury chain?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: Principally, I worked with the Treasury Department but, to a certain
                    extent, at State with the Office of Monetary Affairs in the Bureau of Economic
                    Affairs and, to an extent, with RPE, regional Economic Policy in the European
                    Bureau, and, as occasion required, with economic officers elsewhere. Also, I
                    worked with the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the
                    Treasury, because I was dealing with international banks in the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Secretary of the Treasury when you were there,
                        GeorgSchultz?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: George Schultz was there, and then he left, and was followeby William
                    Simon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, that is when Kissinger and Schultz had their famous
                        arm wrestling match about Hal Sonnenfeldt, I think. They wanted to put
                        Sonnenfeldt in Treasury, and Kissinger said, “No I want him back with me.”
                        He finally won out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: Well, I don't know about that. I was, however, on the fringes of a turf
                    battle between Kissinger and Simon. Bill Simon was a bond trader in New York, a
                    very aggressive man and quite abrasive. When he came to Washington, he and
                    Kissinger took an immediate dislike to each other, as the stories go. This was
                    in late 1973 or early 1974, at the time there was the gasoline shortage. There
                    was great concern at that time about foreign investment, particularly investment
                    by the oil producing countries in the United States. Kiwah Island off the coast
                    of South Carolina was quite an issue. Isolationists in Congress said that Arab
                    countries would buy a piece of the United States and fly foreign flags over it.
                    Treasury was not troubled by freedom of foreign investment flows and thought the
                    concern over threats to our sovereignty overblown. Once Secretary Simon was in
                    New York City, and reporters asked him about the rumors that the Shah of Iran
                    was about to buy some extensive properties in New York City. New York City was
                    in bankruptcy at the time, and Simon was resisting pressure for a Federal
                    bailout of the city. Simon said, “He can buy the whole damn thing. New York and
                    the Shah deserve each other.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not good politics on Simon's part.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: At this point, Simon decided to make his first foreign visit as Secretary
                    and, I believe, practically his first foreign trip ever. He decided that he
                    would accept a speaking invitation in Hamburg, Germany, and then go through
                    Germany down to Monaco, picking up speaking and other engagements along the way,
                    and he was going to wind up in Saudi Arabia. I was asked to write a paper on how
                    the Saudis could invest two billion dollars in the United States. He was going
                    to present it to them. One of the big concerns at that time was how to recycle
                    all of the moneys that were being paid for oil. People at the political level
                    got exercised over this point. The Treasury was fond of saying, “The oil
                    producers are not going to pump dollars back into the ground. They have to
                    invest it someplace, so what's the big deal? It is probably a great opportunity
                    for the United States.” Simon was going to demonstrate that by taking over a two
                    billion dollar portfolio proposal to the Saudis. I wrote the paper and had it
                    split between half in the market, that is the private market, the private
                    sector, and half in various government securities. In the covering note to the
                    Secretary, I stressed that the United States and Arabs had had a rather prickly
                    relationship for a number of years because of our support of Israel. One had to
                    be very careful and discreet. This was the first time that a Secretary of
                    Treasury had visited Saudi Arabia, and discretion was highly important.Simon
                    left on his trip in the early Summer of 1974. I was chagrined to see a report of
                    a speech that Simon gave in Hamburg, Germany, in which he talked about the need
                    for the Saudis to invest in the United States. Then, he kept lifting the veils
                    as he went through Paris. In Monaco, he said, “I have an investment plan for the
                    Saudis when I get there.” When he got there, I think, in his initial public
                    statement he mentioned two billion. I forget exactly what he did, but in any
                    event, the Saudis received him. They were very pleasant and said, “Thank you.
                    We'll think about it.” He came back somewhat irritated that the Saudis had not
                    taken up his two billion dollar offer. “How did we screw up,” he fumed. In point
                    of fact, the Saudis had, and we all knew it, their own investment team. They
                    were very competent people in Europe and the United States who were making
                    suggestions to the Saudi Government on a continuing basis as to how to
                    invest.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: I think there may have been three. The only one I knew of,and I knew him
                    quite well, was John Bushnell. Do you know John?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, a Latin American hand.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: Yes. Well, John was there when I was. I think there waanother fellow whom
                    I really didn't know.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when your tour there was up, it was back to
                        Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: That's right. They asked me to stay on a second year, and then they asked
                    me to leave the Foreign Service and become Treasury attach� in London for as
                    long as I wanted. I felt one government career was enough, so I came back to
                    State. There were a number of assignments that were near misses, but my choices
                    boiled down to either of the following two. One was to be Deputy Principal
                    Officer in Frankfurt because of the high concentration of German banking
                    interests there, and the other was to be Economic Counselor and Treasury Attach�
                    in Saudi Arabia. Had I not been married, I would have, without any question,
                    without any hesitation, gone to Saudi Arabia. This gets back to something again
                    while I was in Treasury. Simon, as I remarked, had gone to Saudi Arabia. He did
                    manage to establish a relationship with the Saudi Government and agreed with the
                    Saudis to set up about 20 or 30 different advisory committees in various
                    activities, including, for example, the following: a banking committee to assist
                    in the development of domestic Saudi banking, an infrastructure committee on
                    roads and things of that sort, and so on. There would be American personnel
                    there working with the Saudis. These were not AID people, because we didn't have
                    AID activity in Saudi Arabia. Henry Kissinger was very upset when he learned
                    that Treasury would be running committees throughout Saudi Arabia, so he got in
                    touch with Simon and said, “There is nothing I can do without embarrassment to
                    roll this back, but I insist that you stay out of Iran. Iran is mine, and State
                    will make policy toward Iran.”</p>
                <p>The job as Economic Counselor in Saudi Arabia would have been the conventional
                    economic counselor job. The responsibilities as Treasury Representative would
                    have been the customary ones along with the additional task of running all of
                    these committees. That would have been a very exciting job. I turned it down
                    ultimately because of the very restrictive attitude that the Saudis have toward
                    women. They can't drive, for example, and so on. I thought that would be asking
                    more of Rozanne than I'd ask of myself. Apart from being very difficult for her,
                    I would have had to leave two children behind in boarding school. I wasn't sure
                    I wanted to do that either. So, I went to Frankfurt as Deputy Principal Officer
                    in the Consulate General where I had begun my career. The Department was pleased
                    to give me this assignment because the German Central Bank (the Bundes Bank) and
                    other major banks are in Frankfurt. The Treasury Representative resided in Bonn;
                    State's pleasure at having me there reflected the attitude toward Treasury
                    representatives, to which I have already alluded.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Principal Officer then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: When I was asked to go, it was Tom Recknagel. Then, Tom's wife, Charlotte,
                    developed a health problem, and, at the last minute, they didn't go. So, Wolf
                    Lehmann was substituted.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I knew them both. How did you and Wolf divide up the
                        duties - because it is a big post, I know - between the Consul General and
                        the Deputy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: My recollection is that Frankfurt was the eighth largest post in the world
                    at the time. We had 17 U.S. Government agencies assigned to the Consulate
                    General, although some of them only had a loose relationship to the
                    Consulate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And, there still was a huge American military presence in
                        Germany.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: A huge American military presence, and the bilateral trade between the
                    consular district and the United States ran five billion dollars a year. That
                    was very important. Wolf and I divided our duties up rather comfortably. Wolf,
                    of course, was Consul General and retained to himself the various
                    representational activities that a consul general would carry out. Wolf retained
                    all of the political-military and the contacts with the political leaders. He
                    gave to me all of the economic and commercial activity as well as all of the
                    consular work. He found that the representational work got to be rather onerous,
                    so we developed the practice of sharing representational activities. He had a
                    great number of Congressional and business delegations. Of course, Wolf would
                    always see the Congressmen and give a reception.</p>
                <p>When appropriate, he would involve me, and he asked me to take the lead with
                    commercial delegations, primarily investment promotion groups. As there was a
                    large American business community in Frankfurt, I developed the practice of
                    meeting monthly with representatives of that sector. Then, there was a
                    bicentennial visit headed by Vice President Nelson Rockefeller with a rather
                    distinguished group. Toward the end of my stay, President Jimmy Carter came
                    once. There was always enough of that sort of activity that Wolf could keep
                    quite busy. We really worked independently from one another in tandem, but of
                    course we kept each other informed.</p>
                <p>From 1977 on, the matter of American citizens in German prisons became important.
                    Mistreatment of U.S. citizens in prison abroad, primarily in Mexico, had become
                    a U.S. political issue which became of concern to Congress. Most of the
                    prisoners were young adults who ad been caught smuggling or selling drugs. In
                    the Frankfurt consular district, some 90-100 U.S. citizens were in prison at any
                    one time. The Department required that each prisoner be visited once a month, a
                    requirement which put considerable strain on our consular staff as we received
                    no increase in personnel. So that I might understand this new responsibility, I
                    made a number of prison visits. It turned out that most of the prisoners were
                    former servicemen who had had served in Germany and liked the life there. Out of
                    the service and without work permits, a number of them turned to drug
                    trafficking. Life was reasonably comfortable in German prisons; for example,
                    they were permitted monthly conjugal visits, could earn vacation from prison for
                    good behavior, and had good English language libraries.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>The head of Morgan Guaranty Bank in Germany mentioned to me the difficulty in
                    spending his funds for local good works in a manner that would not seem puny
                    when compared with the funds similarly available to the large German banks. This
                    gave me an idea. I arranged for the University of Maryland branch in Germany to
                    teach basic courses - English language and literature and American history, as I
                    recall - in the larger German prisons in the Frankfurt consular district. The
                    University's only requirement was that at least five prisoners sign up for each
                    course. Morgan donated funds to this program, as did several other American
                    businesses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Relations with the Army were good?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: Excellent. The fact that Wolf was a politico-military officer and had been
                    our last DCM in Vietnam was important to the military.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about relations with U.S. intelligence groups? I know
                        walways had a number of them around the Frankfurt area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: We did. I felt that a lot of that intelligence activity was spinning
                    wheels, but that is neither here nor there. I was amused once, though, when a
                    CIA officer told me that, in their list of things to do, they were to report on
                    German banking and gold movements. He said that he had that tasking removed from
                    his list of things to do because there was no way that the Agency could top the
                    reporting from the Consulate General.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is a nice commendation for you in some ways, isn't
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: Well, I was surprised they would do that, because turgenerally is an
                    important issue with the intelligence community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your relations with the Frankfurt city
                        authorities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: Rudi Prebisch was the mayor, otherwise known as Red Rudy. We had on, a
                    personal level, good relations; but, he didn't mind sticking his finger in the
                    American eye to the extent he could. He did it once and infuriated Wolf. There
                    was a photographic display at one of the museums, and one of the photographs was
                    of some absolutely horrendous activity in Vietnam. I forget what. It wasn't the
                    little girl running down the street screaming, but it was something like that.
                    It really didn't fit with the theme of that photographic exhibition, and Wolf
                    was furious. He stormed over to the mayor's office and said, “That comes out
                    this afternoon or there will be hell to pay.” By God, he got it out.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good for Wolf. He can work a man over, I know. Did you get
                        uto the embassy in Bonn often?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: I don't know how it is around the world, but in several of the countries I
                    was assigned to, the Deputy was in charge of the E&amp;E planning, which is the
                    emergency and evacuation plan. While I was in Frankfurt, I revised the Consulate
                    General's emergency and evacuation plan to include information on hospitals,
                    hotels, airfields, etc. In the consular district, Rhein-Main Airport, just
                    outside Frankfurt, is the most active airport on the continent of Europe. It
                    seemed to me that Frankfurt would be a logical safe haven for Americans
                    evacuated from danger in other countries. I was subsequently told that the
                    Frankfurt E&amp;E plan was most useful during the evacuation of Americans from
                    Iran in the late '70s.</p>
                <p>There were E&amp;E meetings in Bonn every six months or so. Also, I would get up
                    to Bonn from time to time to talk to the Economic Minister, Ed Crowley, as I had
                    known him. So every six months or perhaps more frequently, I did visit Bonn.
                    Moreover, Embassy officers came to Frankfurt from time to time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any leftovers in Frankfurt from your days
                        dealing with the DPs [displaced persons] and refugees, or were those
                        problems all behind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: Those were all behind in the sense of resident displaced persons.
                    Nevertheless, Germany had a very liberal policy on the admission of persons
                    seeking political asylum. Our visa law had been amended since I was on the
                    displaced persons program to permit the issuance of visas to political refugees.
                    It was very easy for a person to become a political refugee in Germany, and then
                    come to the Consulate General to apply for a visa as a political refugee. During
                    the 1970s, as the Soviet Union relaxed its restrictions on the emigration of
                    Jews to Israel, a number of Soviet Jews obtained emigration permits, then left
                    Israel for Germany where they applied for visas to enter the United States as
                    political refugees; some even left the train in Vienna and came to Germany
                    without going through the formality of entering Israel. The Consulate General in
                    Frankfurt was the only office in Europe (there were none in the Middle East) to
                    issue visas to political refugees seeking asylum in the United States. You knew
                    that the people, when they left the Soviet Union and diverted in Austria, had
                    never had any intention of going to Israel, so they were really playing fast and
                    loose with our law. But, an interpretation by the U.S. Government found them
                    eligible for political refugee status in the United States.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>While Wolf and I were in Frankfurt, we had one extremely interesting case of
                    political asylum seekers. After the military coup in Ethiopia had deposed the
                    Emperor, American missionaries of the Lutheran faith smuggled 17 children from
                    the extended royal family out of Ethiopia to Kenya. Our Embassy in Addis Ababa
                    was furious and demanded that they be brought back to ease tension that had
                    developed in our relations with the military government. The Embassy said the
                    military rulers of Ethiopia assured them that nothing would happen to these
                    children. The missionaries insisted they could not return the children because
                    the government had already executed various relatives of these children and were
                    prepared to exterminate all members of the royal family. The missionaries became
                    concerned about the proximity of Kenya to Ethiopia, and they and the children
                    suddenly popped up in Stockholm, Sweden. This was about 1977.</p>
                <p>Some days later, Wolf got a call from the Charg� in Stockholm and asked me to sit
                    in. The Charge said, “I have got a real peculiar problem here. I was just
                    visited by some missionaries who have these Ethiopian princesses and princes
                    here, and they are becoming increasingly concerned because these children stand
                    out in Stockholm. They believe that the Ethiopian Government will send squads to
                    murder or kidnap the kids. They have been looking at their options and would
                    like to go to Germany where they think that the kids would blend in better
                    because of the black military presence.</p>
                <p>For some reason, probably because Frankfurt was such a large post, we had been
                    receiving all of this traffic. We knew of the outrage in Addis Ababa because the
                    missionaries were now in Stockholm. We knew the Department was very skittish
                    about all of this, so, over the phone, we said, “It is really very difficult for
                    us to put anything in writing. On the other hand, if the missionaries should pop
                    up here with children, what could we do?” The Charge said, “I read you.” He hung
                    up. Two days later, a Marine security guard called up to the front office and
                    said, “ I have got some folks down here with all these children. They say they
                    are missionaries, and the children are princesses and princes. What do I
                    do?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have got a headache!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: We had expected them to pop up. We told the guard to have the visitors
                    brought to the conference room. I think the oldest was about 17 or 18; the
                    youngest was about four. The missionaries were quite concerned, and we talked
                    with them and said, “We will tell you what you have to do.” We walked them
                    through the procedure for applying for political refugee status and so on. They
                    said, “Fine,” they would get in touch with the Lutherans back in the United
                    States. We asked the missionaries where they were going to stay while in
                    Frankfurt. They said, “Don't worry about it. We have got a place,” and they gave
                    us the location. It was in the American area near a military compound. There
                    were a lot of blacks and whites in that community, and they could blend in
                    better than in Stockholm.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>After they left, we sent a message to the Department saying unaccountably we find
                    that we have got these missionaries and children in Frankfurt. The missionaries
                    want to apply for political refugee status for these children. I think about two
                    to three months later, the party left for the United States. Before they left,
                    we called them in again. We advised them that political refugees in the United
                    States must eschew political activity. We thought this really didn't mean a lot
                    because they were kids. They said they understood and they would be very careful
                    in what they said and what they did; and, the missionaries stressed this to the
                    children. They went off, and about nine months later, we were astounded to read
                    in the Stars And Stripes that the 18-year old prince had joined a rock music
                    group to give a performance to protest the government in Ethiopia. So, we got in
                    touch with the Lutheran office in Germany and urged them to pass the word back
                    to him that he was putting his political refugee status in jeopardy. We presume
                    that he received the message, as we heard no more of his participation in the
                    concert.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some of the problems you faced.... Did the Germans you met
                        in your days in Frankfurt believe in reunification or that the Berlin Wall
                        would ever come down, or did they just accept things as they were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: I don't remember any serious discussion of this. Wolf and I divided the
                    chore of attending political rallies and party conventions, and I don't recall
                    the plight of refugees from East Germany or unification ever getting more than
                    lip service. Unification seemed a long ways off in the 1970s. My contacts were
                    primarily with bankers and businessmen who were rather affluent and rather
                    comfortable. They really didn't think about those things. They recognized that,
                    if the Wall came down, there would be terrific economic consequences that might
                    be adverse to their interests. I don't think they particularly worried about it.
                    They even liked the Social Democratic Government under Helmut Schmidt. As I was
                    leaving in 1978, the first campaign between Helmut Schmidt (SPD) and Helmut Kohl
                    (CDU) began. My contacts were fond of saying, “We hope that Schmidt wins, but by
                    such a narrow margin that he has to be very careful what he does,” which is the
                    way the election went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, after your three happy years there, you moved back
                        to Central America or Panama. How did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>BLAKE: I was coming up for transfer. I was still without an assignment and was
                    becoming concerned. John Bushnell telephoned me from the State Department; he
                    was Deputy Assistant Secretary in the American Republics Bureau then, he said,
                    “Mel, I see that you are coming up for assignment. I wonder whether you would go
                    to Panama, because we are going to implement the Panama Canal Treaty. The Senate
                    had approved the Treaty and the instruments of ratification had been deposited.
                    Now, in the interim, he said, “It is going to be an awful lot of work. It will
                    be very interesting work that we think you would enjoy.” I said, “John, I
                    haven't even thought about taking on the Economic Counselor job in Panama, but I
                    have seen that the position of DCM is open. I wonder if I could apply for the
                    Deputy.” He said, “Well, Mel, I think that has already been filled, but in point
                    of fact, you wouldn't have had a chance.” I said, “Why is that?” He said, “The
                    Department is very keen on advancing minorities, and Terry Todman (the Assistant
                    Secretary) has announced that American Republics Affairs is going to be a model
                    for the Department. With the announcement that day of the appointment of a woman
                    ambassador, 50% of the ambassadors in ARA will be representatives of a minority.
                    We are woefully short on the DCM side. He wants to make 50% of the deputies also
                    from minorities.”</p>
                <p>I explained, “John, I am a minority.” He said, “How's that?” I said, “I am from
                    Mississippi. When I was young, Mississippi was 60% black, 40% white.” He said,
                    “Yes?” I continued, “And John, I am a Catholic. Catholics in Mississippi are
                    well less than one percent of the population.” He said, “Yes.” I said, “Now,
                    John. It is even better than that. I had a Jewish grandmother.” John hesitated
                    and then said, “Mel, I understand what you are saying, but you are not minority
                    chic. You have to be minority chic. You have to be either black or a woman. You
                    don't make it.” I said, “Fine John, I'll take the job as Economic
                    Counselor.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the problems you faced there in
                        Panama?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: I got back to the Department, and John and I had several long
                    conversations. He said it is critically important that we get all of the
                    executive agreements and other agreements dealing with the Treaty in place
                    within 15 months. Why 15 months? For some reason, I didn't ask him. In any
                    event, there was this matter of getting these various agreements negotiated and
                    signed. Basically, the agreements undid the intertwining of the Panama Canal
                    Company and the Republic of Panama and established a relationship between two
                    sovereign nations regarding an asset, the Panama Canal, in which they had a
                    mutual interest. By the terms of the Panama Canal Treaty, Panama received the
                    Canal on October 1, 1979, but the United States continued to operate it until
                    the year 2000. Moreover, there were certain parallel arrangements that had to be
                    unscrambled and responsibility handed over to Panama. For example, the FAA
                    administered the Panama flight information center, and we had to hand over that
                    responsibility to Panama.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>I should explain that there are actually two treaties, the Panama Canal Treaty
                    and the Panama Canal Neutrality Treaty. The Panama Canal Treaty is the one which
                    drew the greatest attention, required the most time and effort, and would have
                    resulted in serious problems if anything went awry. Further, it required
                    implementing legislation, since the United States would administer the Canal for
                    another 21 years after the Treaty entered into effect. Also, turnover of
                    responsibilities and the continuance of certain military facilities in Panama
                    involved costs and further negotiations. Implementing legislation required the
                    approval of both houses of Congress, whereas consent to ratification of the
                    Panama Canal Treaty required action only by the Senate. Many House members were
                    furious that they had not had a say in the Treaty and were spoiling to get a
                    crack at the implementing legislation. From Panama, it appeared that the
                    Executive Branch, or perhaps the White House, did not appreciate the
                    significance of the implementing legislation. As I recall, the Ambassador made
                    five trips back to Washington to lobby Congress for passage of the implementing
                    legislation, and I accompanied him on two of these trips. In fact, it was a
                    close call, and the legislation was approved by Congress on September 28, 1979,
                    only three days before the Treaty was to go into effect.Little was said about
                    the Panama Canal Neutrality Treaty. In it, the United States and Panama
                    committed themselves to the permanent neutrality of the Canal and undertook to
                    obtain similar commitments from the world community, in particular the major
                    users of the Canal. Little was done to obtain additional adherents to the
                    Neutrality Treaty, I suspect, because the problems surrounding the basic treaty
                    were immediate and pressing while the matters with which the neutrality treaty
                    was concerned were more conceptual.</p>
                <p>Charles Schmitz was also sent to Panama as Counselor for Treaty Implementation.
                    He would manage all of the arrangements to implement the Treaty across the
                    board. He kept score on them and so on. Some of the things he handled himself;
                    other issues dealing with economic or financial matters were given to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds like a lawyer or something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: Charles was a lawyer. He had been in the legal division, but he had a
                    career of negotiating military base rights. He was the one who handled Okinawa
                    reversion, for example.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. That was a big thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>BLAKE: Charles and I arrived in Panama about October 1, 1979; the Ambassador
                    arrived two days later. Charles coordinated treaty implementation, and I
                    negotiated the economic and financial aspects in addition to running the
                    Economic Section. I found that the Panamanians were euphoric over the Treaty.
                    They felt that, for the first time in our relationship, the United States was
                    going to treat them as equals, so I found it easy to handle the negotiations I
                    was in charge of. In point of fact, I got all of my negotiations done within
                    three months. In the process, I learned that Panama had owed us $5.8 million for
                    temporary housing we had provided them for the Pan American games in the 1950s,
                    and I arranged to collect that debt as well. Nevertheless, it took a year to
                    explain to Washington what a good deal I had gotten from Panama. So, the time
                    did run out to 15 months. The Panamanians were wonderful people to negotiate
                    with, in no small part, because they were so pleased with the relationship. I
                    think they probably didn't mind the store as well as they should have.</p>
                <p>The Ambassador was Ambler Moss. He had been in the Foreign Service. After I
                    retired, I was told by William Walker, who had been Chief of Foreign Service
                    personnel, that ambler was the best junior officer he ever saw. He had worked as
                    staff aide to Sol Linowitz while he was U.S. Ambassador to the Organization of
                    American States. Ambler also had gone to law school at night while serving in
                    the Department and had passed the bar. When Sol Linowitz left the government at
                    the change over from the Johnson to the Nixon Administration, he rejoined
                    Coudert Brothers law firm and asked Ambler to take leave without pay and join
                    Coudert for a year to see whether he would enjoy a career change. Ambler liked
                    the practice of law so much at the Coudert office in Brussels that he decided to
                    stay with them.</p>
                <p>Linowitz was brought back into government in 1978 by Jimmy Carter to negotiate
                    the Panama Canal treaties, and Ambler was his assistant in that effort. After
                    the treaties had been negotiated, the White House asked Ambler to become Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary of State for Congressional Affairs with the sole job of
                    obtaining Senate approval of the Treaties. The day the Senate approved the
                    treaties, Ambler resigned. A friend of mine, David Eugene Boster, was asked then
                    by the State Department to go to Panama as Ambassador. Gene's nomination went
                    over to the White House and Hamilton Jordan saw it. He said that Mr. Boster
                    seems to be a very fine officer, but it has been a very difficult fight to get
                    the Panama Canal Treaty through the Senate, and we have this fellow, Ambler Moss
                    who knows the treaty very well. Maybe, we ought to send him to Panama. So,
                    Ambler got the job.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>As I said earlier, I favor professional diplomats over political appointees as
                    ambassadors. Ambassador Davis, at Bern, was an exception. Ambler Moss was
                    another. As he had resigned his commission as a Foreign Service officer to join
                    Coudert Brothers, he was, at least technically, a political appointee
                    ambassador. He was only some 38-40 years old, extremely young for a career
                    officer to be named an ambassador, and he had, in fact, only one foreign
                    assignment as a career officer. Nevertheless, he was uniquely equipped for the
                    job. First, he was extremely intelligent, and he was flawless in Spanish.
                    Second, his connections gave him panache. When necessary, he could call to the
                    right level in Washington or Panama to get results. And, he was extremely well
                    regarded on Capitol Hill by Members of Congress of both political parties. Even
                    though he was a Democrat, he had a close and productive relationship with
                    Senator Howard Baker, one of the few Republican Senators to support the
                    Treaties. I might also note that his wife, Serena was the grand daughter of
                    Sumner Welles, had lived abroad with her father, Ben Welles, who was with The
                    New York Times, spoke excellent Spanish, and was a great Ambassador's wife.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the DCM?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: The Deputy Chief of Mission was Victor Dikeos, a careesecurity and
                    administrative officer and a pleasant person to work with.</p>
                <p>After I had been in Panama 3-4 months, the Department's personnel office
                    telephoned to ask me whether I would be interested in a transfer to Bonn as
                    Economics Minister. That would have been an important job, but I had already had
                    11 years in Germany and was enjoying Panama. As the AID mission director was
                    retiring, I asked the Ambassador whether he would consider combining the AID
                    mission and the economic section under me; such a combination had been done
                    before in Panama. He said that he would think about it, but I heard no more
                    until the spring. One day, Vic asked me to see the Ambassador before I left at
                    the end of the day. When I saw him, the Ambassador said that Dikeos had
                    unexpectedly submitted retirement papers. He wondered whether I would take the
                    position of DCM. Naturally I accepted and took over around July 1, 1979.</p>
                <p>I took over as Deputy at a busy time. The Somoza regime was falling in Nicaragua,
                    and Americans were evacuated from Managua to Panama. For several weeks, we were
                    running a nonstop evacuation and relief operation out of the Embassy. Then, we
                    had to prepare for the turnover of the Panama Canal to Panama on October 1,
                    1979. Actually, we continued to operate it until 2000 under what was akin to a
                    leaseback arrangement. To do this required implementing legislation, and it was
                    a difficult fight to get Congress to pass it.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>This was the first time that the United States had given up territory in the
                    Western Hemisphere. There was tremendous jingoistic opposition in the United
                    States. The Treaties had been approved by only one vote in the Senate, as I
                    recall, and the implementing legislation had been in serious trouble. Many
                    opponents of the Canal turnover to the Panamanians took the view that the United
                    States had the constitutional, if not international, authority to retake the
                    Canal if President Carter was defeated in his run for a second term in 1980.
                    These domestic U.S. considerations impacted the selection of the U.S.
                    representative to the celebration.</p>
                <p>For its part, Panama wanted a major celebration of the greatest event since the
                    country had achieved its independence from Columbia. The Presidents of all of
                    the member countries of the Organization of American States were invited, as
                    well as the presidents of numerous countries with which Panama had strong
                    economic or cultural relations. All of the Presidents of OAS members, save the
                    United States, announced their intention to attend, and high officials, at the
                    Ministerial level came from other countries. However, even as the date
                    approached, we at the Embassy were uninformed on the U.S. representative.</p>
                <p>We were told by Department officers that President Carter maintained from the
                    beginning that he would not attend, seemingly for domestic political reasons.
                    Similarly, Vice President Mondale said that he would not attend. Zbigniew
                    Brzezinski, the National Security Adviser, was indicated to the Department as
                    the likely Head of delegation. When he learned of this, apparently Brzezinski
                    strongly objected. He protested that Pope John Paul II was coming to the United
                    States and would be in Boston during the Canal ceremonies. As he was a Pole, a
                    Catholic, and the only person in the White House who spoke Polish, he considered
                    himself the logical person to greet the Pope. We were given to understand that
                    Mondale insisted that he should greet the Pope since it would be inappropriate
                    for the President to go to Boston for this purpose. In the end, and I think it
                    was only about two weeks before the event, the President decided that Mondale
                    was the appropriate person to represent him in Panama and that Brzezinski should
                    meet the Pope. Mrs. Mondale did not accompany the Vice President.</p>
                <p>For security reasons, the Embassy had reserved the entire Holiday Inn, actually
                    an excellent multi-storied hotel with a magnificent location on the Bay of
                    Panama. This had been done with the approval of the Department. The General
                    Manager was close to the Embassy and confided that he had to cancel existing
                    reservations to make the Holiday Inn available to us. Virtually all the other
                    guests were to stay at the El Panama Hotel, which the Panamanian Government used
                    for state occasions. It rated above the Holiday Inn, but we at the Embassy were
                    concerned over security for the Vice President. The El Panama was an old hotel
                    with far too many entrances for adequate security controls, and we also Had
                    concerns regarding the number of security personnel from other countries who
                    would be roaming the corridors of El Panama but did not have the training and
                    discipline of our security personnel.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>Once our official representative had been decided upon, things began to fall in
                    place. But, one thing that fell out was our arrangement with the Holiday Inn.
                    When the Vice President's staff heard that he would be staying at a “motel,” as
                    they described it to us, they insisted that he be housed at El Panama; otherwise
                    he would be the object of ridicule. At that point, it was extremely difficult to
                    get sufficient accommodations at El Panama for the entire U.S. party, and the
                    Holiday Inn incurred a loss from our abrupt cancellation.</p>
                <p>An immediate problem was the size of the support party to accompany the Vice
                    President, some 200 persons as I recall, and we were told that they were to be
                    invited to every function surrounding the ceremonies irrespective of rank or
                    responsibility. The size of our party put a strain on the Panamanian protocol
                    officials who were trying to accommodate all the attendees.</p>
                <p>I won't attempt to go into the details of handling a high-ranking visitor and
                    his/her support party or the demands that this party made on the Embassy. I
                    found myself placating an increasingly unhappy staff, unhappy with the
                    ridiculous demands being made upon us, while bringing the more egregious
                    requests from Washington to the Ambassador's attention. Usually an Embassy deals
                    with visitors through the Department, but, in several instances here, Ambler
                    went directly to Richard Moe, the Vice President's Chief of Staff. In every
                    case, save one, he was able to work out a satisfactory solution.</p>
                <p>The exception concerned the arrival time of the Vice President's plane on
                    September 30. Some how, probably from a disgruntled Panama Canal Company
                    employee, the Vice President's party learned that the American and Panamanian
                    flags, which were mounted, one on each side of the entrance to the Panama Canal
                    Company's headquarters building would be reversed on October 1. Historically,
                    the American flag was in the place of honor, and Treaty opponents portrayed the
                    installation of the Panamanian flag in the place of honor on October 1 as a blow
                    to American honor.</p>
                <p>When Mondale learned of the flag lowering ceremony, he asked the time. It was to
                    be at sunset, I forget the actual hour and minute. We reported the time to
                    Washington and received news that the Vice President would be arriving ten
                    minutes later. This made Panamanian President Royo most unhappy. He had hoped
                    that the United States would regard the turnover ceremonies as a joint
                    celebration by our two countries. Yet, the report of the Vice President's
                    arrival time absolutely confirmed what was becoming increasingly clear: namely,
                    that having been objective and just during the negotiations, the United States
                    was now turning churlish. After thinking about it for a bit, Royo noted that he
                    would have been at the airport since early morning greeting arriving Presidents,
                    the last arriving mid-afternoon. He would have been pleased to greet the Vice
                    President, but he saw no reason why he should go home and then return after
                    sunset. In the circumstances, he sent Vice President de la Esprilla to welcome
                    Vice President Mondale. I was not present, but I was told that Mondale was
                    annoyed not to be greeted by the President.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>That evening, there was a program at the National Theater. With the utmost
                    difficulty, we were able to get seats for the entire American party, which
                    occupied over 20 percent of the seats. The Embassy had a reception afterwards at
                    the Holiday Inn so that staff and resident Americans might meet the Vice
                    President, but he did not appear. At midnight, the Panamanians unfurled a
                    gigantic Panamanian flag on the hill overlooking Quarry Heights, where the
                    Southern Command had its headquarters. This was not intended as an affront to
                    the American military but to take advantage of a position from which the flag
                    could be seen from any place in Panama City. By special act of the Panamanian
                    Congress, the flag flies 24 hours a day and is illuminated at night.</p>
                <p>The formal turnover ceremony was the morning of October 1 on the tarmac at
                    Albrook Air Force Base. Unfortunately, the Panamanian speakers used excessive
                    language in describing their accomplishments in regaining the Canal Zone
                    territory. I wonder whether there would have been so much hubris if we had given
                    the appearance of greater magnanimity in the hearings over the implementing
                    legislation and had been more positive in preparing for the October 1
                    celebration.</p>
                <p>After the celebration, the official representatives and the entire U.S. party
                    moved to a luncheon hosted by the Vice President. Everyone was hot after being
                    in the sun for up to two hours. The Vice President was about an hour late in
                    arriving at the luncheon even though he was the host. He appeared fresh, and a
                    number of the guests were not amused to learn that he had gone back to the hotel
                    to shower. President Royo gave a splendid reception that evening at El Panama
                    Hotel to conclude the celebration. Midway through the evening, we Embassy
                    staffers in attendance were quietly asked to go to a guest room in the hotel.
                    There, we were greeted by Mondale, in shirtsleeves, saying that we could now
                    relax and be ourselves.</p>
                <p>The Vice President's party left the next morning. As they were entering the
                    plane, a member of the party told one of the Embassy's administrative officers
                    that he recognized they may have offended people and asked him to make any
                    apologies. Ted replied, “I have only two years remaining on my assignment.
                    There's not enough time.”</p>
                <p>I mentioned earlier that it took about 15 months to get the Department's approval
                    of several agreements to implement the Panama Canal Treaty. That was not a
                    serious problem as the Panama Canal Treaty provided that the U.S. Government
                    make payments to Panama for use of the Canal but did not establish a schedule
                    for such payments. Before the negotiations on Canal payments, I had asked the
                    Panama Canal Company to test various models to determine what would be the best
                    schedule from the U.S. point of view. They advised that monthly payments would
                    be the best for us, and the Panamanians accepted.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>After the Canal turnover ceremony, we had three agreements ready for signature:
                    one on U.S. payments to Panama, one on certain obligations of Panama to the
                    United States, including the $5.8 million debt owed to us since the 1950s, and a
                    third which I don't recall. We set a signing ceremony at the Panamanian Foreign
                    Office toward the end of one morning in the Fall. I don't recall the date.Just
                    after I got to work on that day, Bob Powers, the Public Affairs Officer, came to
                    my office. The Press Officer, Bud Hensgen, had been called by a Panamanian
                    reporter who said that he had heard that the Panamanian Foreign Minister was
                    going to sign the agreement on U.S. payments to Panama and decline to sign the
                    agreement on Panamanian obligations to the United States pending further study.
                    The ceremony schedule called for the agreements to be signed in this order. As
                    the Ambassador had calls before coming to the Embassy, I could not speak to him.
                    Hence, I telephoned the Vice Foreign Minister, Joes Maria Cabrera, to confirm
                    the story. After some hesitation, he said that it was correct and that the
                    Panamanians had intended to tell us during the signing ceremony. At this, I
                    replied that the ceremony was off. Jose Maria expressed surprise and inquired
                    whether the Embassy had authorization to cancel the signings. I told him that
                    this was a matter between the Embassy and the Department of State and suggested
                    that he notify the press that the ceremony had been postponed.</p>
                <p>When the Ambassador arrived, I told him what had happened. He agreed, and we
                    telephoned the Department which agreed as well. Then I telephoned the Panamanian
                    Finance Minister, Ernesto Perez Baillardes who was popularly known as El Toro,
                    to request an urgent appointment. When I saw him that afternoon, I said that we
                    were uninformed of any Panamanian unhappiness with any of the agreements. I was
                    sure that we could work out a solution. Because of the scope for mischief, I
                    suggested that we keep the misunderstanding out of the media. El Toro professed
                    to be uninformed on the details and agreed that the matter had to be treated in
                    strictest confidence.</p>
                <p>I was astounded to read in the Panamanian press the next morning that I had once
                    again proven to be an enemy of Panama and destructive of good relations between
                    our two countries. There was speculation that I should be declared persona non
                    grata. Clearly El Toro was the source of the stories. Funnily, roughly a year
                    previously, an unclassified economic report I had written had caused a similar
                    storm as it had not been regarded as favorable to Panama as it should have been.
                    The flap blew over when President Royo asked the Vice Minister of Finance,
                    Orville Goodin, to examine it, and Orville said that the report was correct and
                    that he was the source of some of my comments.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>The matter of the unsigned agreements dragged on. We would not have been in
                    violation of our Treaty obligation until October 1, 1980. The Panamanians never
                    contacted the Embassy regarding any problems with the agreement on Panamanian
                    obligations. Royo did, however, mention to the Ambassador the agreements and
                    Panama's need for Canal payments on several occasions. The ambassador expressed
                    interest in settling the problem promptly. Finally, as October 1, 1980
                    approached, Royo suggested to the Ambassador that the agreements could be
                    signed, as negotiated, during a certain period when he would be abroad. Clearly
                    Royo wanted to distance himself from the agreements. And so it was done, but
                    without fanfare.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How large was the Embassy when you arrived? Was it a
                        sizablembassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: It was a smallish embassy in terms of State Department personnel; but, in
                    terms of actual bodies, it was the tenth largest U.S. mission in the world. I
                    think we had 16 Government agencies with regional responsibilities represented
                    in Panama. It was similar to the situation we had in Frankfurt. Then, the
                    Embassy had important inter-agency relations with the Southern Military Command
                    and the Panama Canal Company. In fact, Brasilia, Mexico City, and Panama were
                    the only Class I diplomatic missions in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How big was your economic section?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: The economic section was very small. We had a commercial attach�, a junior
                    officer, one secretary, two local employees, and myself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there opposition in Panama to the treaty or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: When I arrived, and for the first year, I would say, on the whole, no.
                    While a small minority of Panamanians profited from the status quo, the Panama
                    Canal Treaty was widely acclaimed and resulted in a great deal of good feeling.
                    The Panamanians had felt for years that they were under our patronage and that
                    we treated them more as children than as an independent country; with the Treaty
                    ratification, which meant the Canal and the Zone would be returned to Panama,
                    they felt that, for the first time since their independence, they were being
                    recognized as equals. The bruising fight over implementing legislation, the
                    persistent right-wing comment in the United States that we could take back the
                    Canal, and some of the language used by Presidential candidate Ronald Reagan and
                    his supporters during the 1980 campaign resulted in a cooling of Panamanian
                    innocence. You might say that they became more realistic in their expectations
                    for future U.S.-Panamanian relations. I found it sad that time produced this
                    result as the changed relationship lost us influence we could have used to
                    produce a lot of good.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, this enthusiasm for the treaty was not carried
                        over tthe American residents in Panama.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: The Panama Canal Company employees who were American citizens were
                    adamantly opposed to the Treaty, as were most of the American citizens who were
                    permanent residents of Panama and, for the most part, ran small businesses. They
                    regarded it as a State Department sell-out of American interests. The American
                    businessmen in Panama, by and large, sided with the Panama Canal Company
                    personnel but were not as vocal. The American citizens who represented large
                    American corporations, principally banks, and were subject to periodic
                    transfers, generally stayed above the arguments over the return of the Canal to
                    Panama. The Embassy had a highly competent Consul General, Howard Gross, and his
                    availability to American citizen employees of the Canal materially reduced their
                    problems of adjustment to the new situation.By the way, when I got to Panama,
                    over 70 percent of the employees of the Panama Canal Company were Panamanian

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the strong man General Torrijos. We have read
                        about his involvement in the drug problem. Do you know anything about that?
                        Were you aware of that when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: General Torrijos was never, to the best of my knowledge, associated with
                    drug trafficking. His brother, Hugo, was, however, suspected as being associated
                    with the drug trade. Hugo was Ambassador either to Italy or to the Vatican. In
                    the early 1970s, he was to transit the United States upon returning to Panama.
                    The Justice Department had plans to pick him up while in transit at a U.S.
                    airport. Kissinger had instructions sent to the Ambassador in Panama, at that
                    time it was Bob Sayre, that he should notify Torrijos of the likelihood that his
                    brother would be arrested and suggested that Hugo re-route his travel to avoid
                    the United States. This was done. Somehow it leaked into the press and caused a
                    great deal of embarrassment to Bob Sayre who had simply been following
                    instructions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I can believe that. Well now, you were there during
                        the visit of the Shah of Iran, or should I say more than a visit, to Panama.
                        Can you describe that to us?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: About December 1, 1979, I got to work, and Ambler was already there. I
                    usually got to work before him, so that caught my attention. He asked me to join
                    him in his office. He said, “You'll never know who I was sitting with up until a
                    few hours ago.” I said, “Who?” He said, “Hamilton Jordan.” I forget the other
                    person, maybe Lloyd Cutler, but I could be wrong. I said, “Really?” He said,
                    “Yes. Now, we have company coming.” I said, “Who?” He said, “The Shah of Iran.”
                    Around December 15th, the Shah arrived. He moved out to Contadora Island in the
                    bay of Panama and stayed there for several months.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Causing you no difficulty at the embassy or any
                        problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: Not really, no. The Shah was a very easy person to deal with. He had a
                    American public relations man named Robert Armao, whom he had hired at the
                    suggestion of David Rockefeller when it became clear that he would have to leave
                    Iran. Bob told me that, in his first meeting with the Shah, the Shah asked him
                    to arrange his departure from Iran with his extended family, noting that his
                    sister had never had to do anything and didn't even know how to pack a suitcase.
                    Bob was a principal contact between the Shah and us. It was only occasionally
                    that anyone from the Shah's Iranian staff got in touch with us. This was
                    consistent with the understanding that the Shah was a guest of Panama and should
                    look to the Panamanians for logistical and other support.</p>
                <p>There was, nevertheless, a source of friction from the day the Shah arrived. He
                    came to Panama from the United States where he had been a guest of the U.S.
                    Government, a guest whose presence became an embarrassment when Iranian students
                    took over our Embassy with the ill-concealed approval of the Iranian Government.
                    When the Shah left the United States for Panama, it was his understanding that
                    he was still our guest and that he had access to U.S. facilities, for example,
                    the U.S. Army's Gorgas Hospital in the Panama Canal area. For their part, the
                    Panamanians assumed that he had left the hospitality of the U.S. Government and
                    was now a guest of the Panamanian Government. They understood that we would have
                    a continuing interest in the Shah because of the Embassy hostages and our
                    decades-long relationship with him, but they assumed that they were responsible
                    for his care and security.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A rather indelicate question, but did we lean on the
                        Panamanianto accept him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: Not at all. Ambler handled that directly with Torrijos, and Torrijos was
                    quite pleased to have the Shah there. He perceived Panama as helping the United
                    States when it was in an awkward position, and he likely thought that it would
                    give Panama additional weight in its dealings with Washington. Besides, Torrijos
                    enjoyed the publicity.</p>
                <p>Within a brief period, however, relations between the Panamanians and the Shah
                    and his entourage began to sour. Bob Armao complained to me that the Panamanians
                    were gouging the Shah on the assumption that he had limitless funds. Torrijos
                    told the Ambassador that the Shah's entourage were demanding and did not
                    appreciate the financial burden placed on Panama by their presence. As best I
                    could tell, both sides were right.</p>
                <p>Then, things turned ominous for the Shah. The Iranian Government threatened to
                    have him extradited as a criminal, making clear that the Shah would be executed
                    upon arrival. At the same time, there were intimations that the Shah's return to
                    Iran might lead to release of the Embassy hostages. As Torrijos was in a
                    honeymoon phase with the U.S. Government, the Iranians were uncertain how long
                    they could trust their hosts.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>The Shah was an ill man when he arrived in Panama, and his health began to
                    decline further in late January or early February. It appeared that he would
                    need an operation, and the Shah understood that the arrangements on his stay in
                    Panama permitted him access to Gorgas Hospital. The Panamanians took the
                    position that he was a guest of Panama and that it would be an affront to the
                    Panamanian medical profession if he were not operated upon in Panama. In fact,
                    most of the Panamanian doctors I knew were trained in the United States and were
                    quite skilled; further, Punta Patilla Hospital was highly regarded. Even so, the
                    Shah and his party were reluctant to trust the Panamanian doctors and medical
                    facilities. There may have also been some fear that he would be murdered on the
                    operating table.</p>
                <p>The Embassy was only marginally involved in these concerns. The Shah's friends in
                    the United States, principally Kissinger and David Rockefeller, were putting
                    pressure on our Government to have any operation performed at Gorgas, or even
                    that the Shah be returned to the United States. Bob Armao made no bones about it
                    that he would like the Shah back in the United States. In March, we were told
                    that Dr. Michael Dubakey would be coming to Panama to assess the Shah's
                    condition and to perform an operation. I believe that he arrived in early March.
                    He was there at the request of the Shah, so the Embassy had only a secondary
                    role.</p>
                <p>Dr. Dubakey examined the Shah and toured Punta Patilla Hospital and went over
                    arrangements with his Panamanian Government handlers. Then, problems developed.
                    As Dr. Dubakey explained it to the Ambassador and me, he considered the
                    Panamanian hospital adequate but not great. The problem was that the Panamanian
                    doctors noted that he did not have visiting rights at that hospital and, hence,
                    could not perform the surgical procedure. They would have no problem, however,
                    with his presence in the operating room as an observer. Dubakey was opposed to
                    this; as he put it, if the Shah should die on the operating table, the press
                    would concentrate on him even if he had no part in the surgical procedure.</p>
                <p>At this point, the Ambassador had to leave for David, near the Costa Rican
                    border, to fulfill a long-standing speaking commitment. The next day, Dr.
                    Dubakey was joined by other non-Panamanian doctors from the United States and
                    France. All had treated the Shah or operated on him at one time or another.
                    There was a split within their ranks, as some wanted the Shah returned to the
                    United States for any operation or, at a minimum, to be operated on at Gorgas.
                    Meantime, the Panamanian doctors became more insistent that there should be no
                    operation unless a Panamanian team performed it. As one Panamanian doctor put it
                    to me, “Panama is not Afghanistan, and we won't allow an itinerant surgeon
                    here.” This comment became a Panamanian battle cry. The media had learned of the
                    dispute, and correspondents were pouring into Panama. By that afternoon, the
                    situation had become so tense that I telephoned the Ambassador saying he should
                    return to the Embassy. He arrived that night and went to see Torrijos at once.
                    Torrijos was furious at the perceived slur upon the competence of the Panamanian
                    doctors but asked one of his entourage, Marcel Salamin, to serve as intermediary
                    with the Panamanian doctors.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>There was intense scurrying around the next day. Ruffled Panamanian feathers had
                    to be smoothed. The Shah had been moved to Punta Patilla Hospital somewhat
                    against his will. Toward the end of the day, Salamin met with the Ambassador and
                    me and said that the Panamanian doctors had reluctantly agreed that Dr. Dubakey
                    could perform the operation and they would observe; but, any press releases
                    would have to indicate that all parties were in the operating room and not
                    indicate that Dr. Dubakey had the lead. Dubakey agreed.</p>
                <p>I had to go to the Shah's hospital suite to explain to his aide, an Iranian
                    colonel, that Dr. Dubakey would perform the operation. I had to spend several
                    minutes in a sort of sitting room to his hospital room. An expensively dressed
                    Iranian lady, a fur coat beside her, was sitting on a couch, spooning Cheeze
                    Whiz onto crackers. She looked up apologetically and explained, “My supper.” She
                    was the Shah's twin sister.</p>
                <p>The next day, there was a meeting of the Panamanian and other doctors. Everyone
                    made an effort to be pleasant. Dr. Dubakey reviewed his findings and the
                    surgical procedure that would be undertaken. The other American doctors chimed
                    in. The Panamanians listened. This was a Friday, as I recall, and the operation
                    was set for Sunday. Then, a French doctor, Georges Flandrin, spoke up. He
                    described himself as the Shah's physician and asked Dubakey, “Is it urgent that
                    the operation be performed so soon?” When Dubakey replied in the negative, Dr.
                    Flandrin announced, “Tempers have become so inflamed that I would not trust any
                    of you to operate on a patient of mine. I ask for a week's cooling off period.”
                    Although this would be inconvenient, Dubakey agreed.</p>
                <p>Reports of the fighting between the doctors must have gotten back to the Shah.
                    Two or three days later, we were told that he had decided to accept an
                    invitation from President Sadat to return to Egypt, where he had been when he
                    first left Iran. Our Government was somewhat reluctant to see him move again,
                    probably because it might further complicate efforts to free the American
                    hostages in Iran. Hamilton Jordan and Lloyd Cutler came to Panama to review the
                    decision with the Shah. Their visit was secret; Jordan stayed with the
                    Ambassador and Cutler at our house. As the Shah insisted that he leave Panama,
                    they reluctantly agreed and arranged a charter plane for him and his party. The
                    Shah departed Panama on March 24, 1980.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your relations with the United States Southern
                        Command,the military command?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: The Southern Command was quite cordial on the whole. In Panama going back
                    some 15 years or more, there was a tripartite committee, which met about every
                    month or six weeks, and included the Ambassador, the Commanding Officer of the
                    Southern Military command, and the Head of the Panama Canal Administration. The
                    Panama Canal Company was renamed the Panama Canal Administration after the
                    treaty entered into force on October 1, 1979.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>There was one matter which caused some temporary unhappiness in Southern Command
                    circles. With the exception of a brief period, I believe during World War II,
                    the Embassy in Panama had no Defense Attache station. The Southern Command had
                    purported to handle U.S.-Panamanian military relations. The Embassy did have a
                    small Military Assistance Advisory Group, headed by a Colonel, to handle
                    military aid and some training at U.S. military installations, but it was more
                    akin to AID than it was to a diplomatic activity. After the treaties had entered
                    into force, I suggested to the Ambassador that the Embassy should seek a Defense
                    Attache, primarily to demonstrate to the Panamanians that the old regime was
                    over and that we regarded Panama in the same light as we regarded any other
                    country with which we had diplomatic relations. I also noted that there would be
                    occasions when it would be desirable for the Embassy to deal directly with the
                    Panamanian military rather than be obliged to go through the Southern Command.
                    He agreed and we requested through channels that a Defense Attache station be
                    opened.</p>
                <p>Shortly thereafter, the officer in charge of Defense attach� stations in Latin
                    America came from Washington to Panama and called on the Ambassador and me,
                    along with several Southern Command officers.</p>
                <p>They wondered why we wanted to depart from an arrangement that had seemed to work
                    so well for decades. The Ambassador explained that we thought it time to put our
                    defense relations with Panama on the same level as other countries in Latin
                    America. When they found this unconvincing, I noted that we had a Defense
                    attach� station at the embassy in Bonn, to cite one example, even though there
                    were several major military commands in Germany. The Southern Command
                    intelligence officer, a Colonel, then proposed a Colonel on the Southern Command
                    staff. The Ambassador said that we would get back to them on this proposal.</p>
                <p>The Ambassador and I knew this officer. He was a West Pointer and a bright
                    officer, but he had been less than candid with us on several occasions and we
                    doubted that he would transfer his loyalty from the Southern Command to the
                    Embassy. As you can appreciate, the objectives and priorities of the Southern
                    Command and any embassy within the Command's area of responsibility could
                    diverge. At the Ambassador's request, I informed the Southern Command of his
                    decision.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>Then I telephoned the personnel officer in the Attache system. He was
                    disappointed that we would not take the Southern Command officer but decided it
                    would be best for that officer's career if he went elsewhere. Instead, he
                    offered us Lieutenant Colonel Gerald Walker who was coming out of El Salvador
                    where he had been Defense Attache, adding that he was the best attach� in Latin
                    America. We accepted Walker and he did a splendid job. When he reported in, I
                    told him that every intelligence agency in Panama was playing up to Noriega. As
                    Defense Attache, he would present his credentials to Noriega, who was the
                    principal intelligence officer in the Guardia Nacional at the time, but I wanted
                    him to become intimate with the next generation of Panamanian military officers.
                    Walker wrote a report on the comers that should have been a basic source book
                    for years to come.</p>
                <p>Let me also mention relations with the Panama Canal authorities. Prior to October
                    1, 1979, the Canal was under the Panama Canal Company, headed by an Army Corps
                    of Engineers General with a Corps Colonel as his deputy. On October 1, 1979, the
                    Company was renamed the Panama Canal Administration with an American civilian as
                    the Administrator and a Panamanian as the Deputy Administrator. The first
                    Administrator was Phil McAuliffe who had been a Lieutenant General and head of
                    the Southern Command through September 30, 1979, when he retired from the Army.
                    Phil was well known to the Carter Administration and he had testified
                    persuasively on the treaties before various Senate and House committees. Phil's
                    Panamanian Deputy was Fernando Manfredo who had participated in the Treaty
                    negotiations and was well and favorably known to the U.S. Government. By the
                    terms of the Panama Canal Treaty, Manfredo's appointment had to receive the
                    consent of the Senate, as did Phil's.</p>
                <p>Embassy relations with McAuliffe and Manfredo were excellent, I would say even
                    better than relations with the Southern Command. The Embassy-Southern
                    Command-Canal committee meetings continued, but Manfredo could not participate
                    as we frequently discussed confidential matters. Lieutenant General Wallace
                    Nutting replaced Phil as head of the Southern Command. Wally had been Commander
                    of a tank division headquartered at Frankfurt, Germany, before coming to Panama,
                    and we had always gotten along well. Occasionally he would express frustration
                    to me over the nuances of being a sort of military diplomat to so many Latin
                    American countries and lament that he had left the Fulda gap where it was so
                    easy to distinguish the good guys from the bad. Phil was a polished
                    Administrator and ran the Canal superbly, although at times he had to restrain
                    himself from intruding upon Southern Command matters.</p>

                <p>BLAKE: It was a Saturday morning, July 31, 1981. I was just having breakfast when
                    someone called from the military command and said that they had been asked by
                    the Panamanian Government to make a search for a plane when daylight came.</p>
                <p>General Torrijos' plane had left mid-afternoon Friday from Panama City to go to a
                    mountain town he liked, but the plane never arrived. I immediately went to the
                    Embassy. Ambler was taking a well-deserved long weekend at a beach resort with
                    his family. By the time I got to the Embassy, a Panamanian civilian pilot had
                    spotted the wreckage of the General's airplane on a mountainside and reported
                    it. The Southern Military Command had rangers go in from helicopters to confirm
                    that everyone aboard was dead.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that have any immediate effect on our relations with
                        Panamat all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: Well, it was one of those cases where there was intense cooperation
                    between the Panamanians and us in efforts to find the plane. The Southern
                    Command made an extraordinary effort to assist the Panamanians in recovering the
                    bodies. As it was the rainy season and the terrain was mountainous and quite
                    steep, this took two days, as I recall. The Canadian manufacturers of the plane
                    and the American manufacturers of the engines wanted their own representatives
                    on the team to assess the reasons for the crash. A number of media
                    representatives flew in to cover the crash and try to get something sensational
                    on the implications for democracy in Panama. While I was wrestling with these
                    matters, I also monitored the reports coming in from other embassies and through
                    the Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS). Toward the end of the day, I
                    saw an FBIS report from Moscow stating Tass had reported that the CIA had
                    sabotaged the General's plane to kill him and get him out of the way. I
                    immediately sent a telegram to Secretary Shultz protesting the story and urging
                    him to call in the Soviet Ambassador in Washington and read him the riot act.
                    When the CIA station chief saw a comeback copy of my telegram, he protested that
                    the U.S. Government “neither confirms nor denies stories that have intelligence
                    implications.” I knew that this was our policy, but the Soviet slander was so
                    egregious I considered that it needed redressing. Apparently the Secretary felt
                    the same way, because the Soviet Charg� was called in on Sunday and given a
                    dressing down. Even so, this fabrication persisted, and Graham Greene has it in
                    the last chapter of his book on Torrijos.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>It was difficult to reach the Ambassador at the beach resort. Actually, he met a
                    Panamanian Government friend on the beach who told him of the crash. He
                    telephoned me to confirm and returned to Panama City that night. Then, there
                    were preparations for the funeral; the U.S. Government sent down a delegation
                    that included Barbara Bush, the Vice President's wife, for the event. The
                    Embassy was not a party to selection of the American delegation to the funeral
                    services, but I understand that there was a bit of a tussle between the Vice
                    President's office, which thought that she should be head of delegation, and the
                    State Department, which took the position that Tom Enders, Assistant Secretary
                    of State for American Republics Affairs, should be the head of delegation, this
                    being necessary to ensure that an official representative of President Reagan
                    was the Head of the U.S. delegation. The State Department prevailed.</p>
                <p>There was a period of some uncertainty in the Panamanian Government after
                    Torrijos' death. Florencio Flores, a solid soldier, took over the Guardia
                    Nacional. He was considerably less flamboyant than Torrijos and made a competent
                    leader. However, Manuel Noriega moved up to the number two position. setting the
                    ground for future trouble. Thoughtful Panamanians began privately to express
                    misgivings regarding the future.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall any other problems during your stay in
                        Panama?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: As I said, the ground was laid by Torrijos' death for future trouble.
                    Torrijos had tried, probably more than he was given credit for, to get the
                    civilian leaders to take charge and run the government, with the understanding
                    that they would keep their hands off the Guardia Nacional. Nevertheless, the
                    civilians were reluctant to assume too much authority and kept checking with the
                    General. They probably had reason to do so, because the Constitution was amended
                    after the 1968 coup to give the Guardia Nacional equal status to the executive,
                    legislative, and judicial branches of government. While Flores tried to stay
                    above politics, the colonels under him, in particular Noriega, became more
                    intrusive after Torrijos' death.</p>
                <p>I never met Torrijos, but I did see Noriega from time to time. He was a complex
                    man: shrewd and calculating, quite personable when he wanted to be, ambitious,
                    and to my mind, without morals. Apparently he had severe acne when he was young,
                    and he was quite sensitive regarding his appearance. A stocky man and, I
                    presume, a good soldier. He was a graduate of the Peruvian Military Academy;
                    virtually all Guardia Nacional officers either went to the military academy in
                    Peru or El Salvador. Noriega was the Chief of Intelligence in the Guardia
                    Nacional, but he also carried the responsibilities in the Panamanian Government
                    of the FBI, DEA, and likely other law-enforcement or investigative agencies that
                    I can't recall at the moment.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>I first met Noriega in August 1979 shortly after I had become Deputy chief of
                    Mission and during the period when the implementing legislation for the Panama
                    Canal Treaty was being hotly debated in the U.S. Congress. A Panamanian
                    informant told an Embassy officer that two American soldiers of fortune had been
                    arrested while attempting an attack on the Guardia Nacional headquarters at
                    David. One was Hispanic and the other a Caucasian named Fleming. Both had been
                    in the Army in Viet Nam and had a hatred of communism. They had entered Panama
                    from Costa Rica with the object of starting a revolution to overthrow the
                    presumed communist government of Panama.</p>
                <p>Fleming and the other fellow were questioned intensively at David. It appeared
                    that they had been acting alone and they were to be transferred to the prison on
                    Coiba island by helicopter. When Noriega heard of their activities, he was
                    furious, and he ordered that, en route, they were to be thrown into the Pacific
                    Ocean. The informant said that he had grown to like Fleming and found the two of
                    them out of touch with reality but no threat to Panama and not deserving of the
                    fate planned for them.</p>
                <p>At the moment, the Ambassador was in Washington working the Hill in support of
                    the implementing legislation. I decided to call on Arturo Morgan-Morales,
                    foreign policy adviser to President Royo. As an aside, Morgan-Morales was an
                    interesting fellow. His father had gone to Panama somewhat before World War I to
                    establish a business, married a Panamanian lady, and stayed on. Arturo's parents
                    sent him to Colorado College in 1941 to master English. Terrified that he might
                    do something rash after the attack on Pearl Harbor, his mother telephone
                    Colorado and learned that he had joined the Army. Being a good Panamanian
                    mother, she started thinking of people she might get in touch with and recalled
                    a young Army officer named Eisenhower. She wrote General Eisenhower a letter and
                    never heard from him, but in the spring of 1942 Private Morgan-Morales was
                    surprised to receive an assignment as General Eisenhower's Spanish language
                    interpreter. After the war, Arturo finished college on the GI bill of rights. At
                    the age of 28, he was Panama's Deputy Foreign Minister when President Eisenhower
                    visited Panama.</p>
                <p>Back to my story. I explained the situation to Arturo, noting that the news of
                    the arrests had not come to the attention of the media. However, inevitably the
                    two Americans' disappearance would come out and there would be a strong negative
                    effect on Panama if it became known that they had disappeared in Panama. That
                    would surely doom the implementing legislation. Arturo saw the gravity of the
                    situation at once and excused himself to go speak to Royo. He returned a few
                    minutes later and said that the President had telephoned Noriega that I was
                    calling on him to discuss the disappearance of two American citizens.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>I went to Noriega's office in the Guardia headquarters. I was ushered into a
                    windowless waiting room, some 10 x 10 feet. The four walls were covered with
                    paintings. When I examined them, I found that they were all of weeping children,
                    seemingly 4-6 years old, from a variety of ethnic and geographic backgrounds. I
                    suppose that this introduction to Noriega's world was designed to intimidate
                    callers.</p>
                <p>Noriega was quite pleasant when we met. He listened intently to my story of two
                    Americans who had disappeared on the Costa Rican-Panamanian border and our
                    concern that they might have become lost and wandered into Panama. He accepted
                    my explanation that we were concerned for their well being and feared that, if
                    anything happened to them, opponents of the Panama Canal Treaty might use it as
                    a pretext to try to overturn the Treaty or to upset the good relations we were
                    building between our two countries. Noriega said that he had just returned from
                    a trip abroad, which was true, and would look into the matter and get back in
                    touch with me.</p>
                <p>The next day an Embassy officer told me that Noriega had discovered that, indeed,
                    the Americans were in Panama and in Guardia custody after attempting to attack
                    the Guardia headquarters in David. He was having them transferred to Panama City
                    where they would be turned over to civilian authorities. Undoubtedly, they would
                    have to be tried. The arrest then became public. The Consulate followed the
                    case. After a speedy trial, the pair was found guilty and expelled from
                    Panama.Some six months later, Fleming filed a law suit against the State
                    Department and the Embassy for not assisting him. Nothing came of the case,
                    however.</p>
                <p>In the first half of 1980, I had occasion again to see Noriega. Howard Gross, the
                    Consul General, briefed me on the case of a missing American with which he had
                    been dealing. A young man from Florida had come to Panama to row by kayak from a
                    point south of Colon, on the Gulf of Mexico side of the country, to the border
                    with Colombia. He wanted to explore the San Blas Indian culture. He seemed a
                    fine person; he had finished law school with honors and had clerked for and
                    Appeals Court Justice, and was taking the vacation in Panama between that job
                    and entering a law firm. He had telephoned his parents before leaving for
                    Colombia; thereafter they heard nothing from or concerning him. The father had
                    contacted the Embassy's Consular Section, which had made extensive inquiries but
                    had turned up nothing. The father was en route to Panama, and Howard asked me to
                    speak with him.</p>
                <p>Howard brought the father to my office the next day. He acknowledged that his son
                    had no experience with kayaks or paddling in open waters. He saw no problem,
                    however, as his son was young and strong. If there had been a water accident, he
                    was convinced that the kayak would have drifted ashore and would have been
                    found. He wondered whether a search party could be dispatched. As there were no
                    facilities for such a search in the Southern Command, I asked Howard to see
                    whether Noriega had any suggestions. As the Guardia Nacional had stations in the
                    San Blas, he might be able to help.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>Noriega went farther than I would have expected. He instructed a Guardia coastal
                    craft commander and crew to search the coast from Colon to the border with
                    Colombia, and he allowed us to send a Vice Consul on the boat to assist in the
                    search. It took a week, and the search turned up nothing. At one stop, however,
                    the Indians said that the American had turned up and had spoken with the two
                    Guardia personnel. They insisted that they had seen a young American in a boat
                    and that he had left to continue down the coast. As the father was sure that his
                    son had considerable funds on him for his return trip to the United States. He
                    insisted that his son had been murdered. Noriega brought the two Guardia to
                    Panama City for questioning but nothing turned up. The father then asked for
                    searches throughout the interior on the assumption that his son may have paddled
                    up a river which flows into the Gulf. This area had already been covered by the
                    earlier inquiries for the missing son, but fresh inquiries were made. In all, it
                    was a strong effort to help us, but the distraught father was never disabused of
                    his conviction that his son had met with foul play.</p>
                <p>My last encounter with Noriega took place two days before I left Panama. The U.S.
                    Government was about to start a new program on drug interdiction in the
                    Caribbean Basin. A DEA officer and the State Department's officer for drug
                    policy affecting Latin America wanted to visit Panama and brief Noriega. Noriega
                    was head of the Panamanian equivalent of DEA. The Embassy's DEA officer was the
                    action officer for the visit, and he thought that the meeting with Noriega would
                    have more impact if I, as the departing Charge, sat in on the meeting. When
                    Noriega expressed interest in the meeting but found it difficult to work into
                    his schedule on such short notice, I invited him to breakfast. He came with a
                    young Guardia officer whom he introduced as his aide on drug matters and a
                    translator. The State and DEA officers gave an extensive briefing. Noriega asked
                    questions from time to time. I was interested that he worked through the
                    translator, but interrupted from time to time give, in English or Spanish, a
                    more accurate rendering of comments. Clearly he knew English much better than he
                    let on. Back at the Embassy, the visitors expressed pleasure over the meeting
                    and Noriega's interest in drug interdiction. As one put it, “Tony is really on
                    top of drugs.”</p>
                <p>While I was in Panama, I never saw anything to indicate that Noriega was involved
                    in drugs. During my last year there, that is, 1982, the Embassy was visited by
                    several Congressional staffers who asserted that they had irrefutable evidence
                    that Noriega was facilitating drug traffic through Panama. They promised to send
                    such reports to the Embassy, but we never received them, and the Executive
                    Branch treated Noriega as a partner in drug interdiction as long as I was in
                    Panama.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>Given the comments I was hearing regarding Noriega during 1982, I began to think
                    that we should exercise some caution in relations with him. I think that one
                    incident confirmed the need for caution. In the summer of 1982, the Embassy's
                    DEA officer told me that a boat would be putting into a Panamanian fishing port
                    on the border with Colombia, on the Gulf side. DEA understood that a sizable
                    shipment of cocaine would be loaded, and the boat would be seized when it got
                    back into international waters. He felt an obligation to tell Noriega of the
                    plan. If he didn't, Noriega would see that he had been cut out of the loop and
                    would be angry. As his instructions did not require him to inform Noriega, I
                    advised against it, but he was new to the Embassy and felt that he should lean
                    over backwards to maintain good relations with Noriega. He did tell Noriega of
                    the plan and later told me that the boat was denied permission to dock as it
                    approached the port. The planned seizure was frustrated.</p>
                <p>In the spring of 1982, Ambassador Moss, who had remained from the Carter
                    Administration into the Reagan Administration, submitted his resignation. It was
                    accepted, and he left in June. I was told that I would remain as Charg� until
                    the next Ambassador arrived. However, about the same time as the Ambassador's
                    departure, the Panamanian Government announced that President Royo was stepping
                    down to become the Panamanian Ambassador to Madrid and that Vice President
                    Ricardo de la Espriella would replace him. The Guardia Nacional had forced him
                    out. Royo was a fine lawyer and friendly toward the United States even though he
                    was regarded as left wing. De la Espriella was brilliant; he was head of the
                    Panamanian Central Bank at the age of 28. I am not sure why the colonels in the
                    Guardia Nacional found Royo unacceptable, but they may have believed that de la
                    Espriella might be more compliant. He struck me as nervous concerning his
                    relations with the Guardia. We talked by telephone several times a week, and I
                    recall that on one occasion a Guardia member answered by call to the President.
                    De la Espriella usually saw me at the National Bank, where he retained, an
                    office as he felt more relaxed there than in the President's office. When I
                    mentioned the Guardia intercept to him, he said it and other evidence revealed
                    that Noriega had tapped his telephone.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>Whatever the case, I had known de la Espriella since my arrival in Panama, and we
                    began a number of informal meetings on ways to bolster Panama's place in
                    entrepot trade and as a neutral country. This meant efforts to build up
                    international banking, insurance, and stock trading. Panama had already become a
                    respectable international banking center, but the legislation needed refinement.
                    There were some 70 international banks in the country, and the names reminded me
                    of Frankfurt or Zurich. I should note that there was probably a lot of flight
                    capital from other, less stable Latin American countries administered through
                    Panama, but no evidence was ever presented to me that would have shown that
                    Panama-based banks were engaged in laundering drug money. Historically, Panama
                    had been a refuge for Latin American political leaders who had to leave their
                    capitals suddenly to avoid arrest or something worse during a coup. Also, Panama
                    had good medical facilities by Latin American standards, and many prominent
                    Latinos would come there for treatment. It was thus logical to try to develop
                    the economy by taking advantage of the country's location and orientation on the
                    services sector. It also meant emphasizing efforts to obtain third-party
                    adherents to the Panama Neutrality Treaty, which had been neglected since it had
                    entered into force on October 1, 1979.</p>
                <p>I was replaced by Ted Briggs, who came in as Ambassador, in late October 1982
                    before de la Espriella and I had time to achieve anything. As I was leaving, the
                    Panamanian Government gave me the Balboa award, the highest honor that Panama
                    bestows upon a non-Panamanian. Then de la Espriella was the victim of another
                    coup within two years after Noriega took over the Guardia Nacional.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Enough said about that. Then, after your four years, I
                        believe, in Panama, you moved back to Washington where you became a foreign
                        policy advisor. Tell me something about that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>BLAKE: I came back to Washington unassigned, and I was asked to do several
                    interim jobs. I was asked to do public policy with regard to our involvement in
                    Central America, the Sandinistas, and all of that. My principal responsibilities
                    were to brief Members of Congress and delegations or groups, which called on the
                    State Department to express opposition to our policy of support for the
                    Government of El Salvador and our anti-Sandinista policy. I also had speaking
                    engagements outside of Washington. One of the more interesting took place just
                    after I began work in public diplomacy. It was at Smith College, an upscale
                    women's college in western Massachusetts. All I knew was that I was asked at the
                    last minute to go to Smith for a panel discussion of our Central American
                    policy. At dinner immediately before the discussion, I was told that I was a
                    stand-in for Ambassador Jean Kirkpatrick who had accepted and then backed out
                    wen the College would not guarantee her personal safety. The panel had four
                    members, three opposed to our policy and I in support of it. One opponent was
                    the fellow who had been on the National Security Council during the Nixon
                    Administration and had his telephones bugged by National Security Adviser
                    Kissinger who suspected him of leaking material to the media. He kept pressing
                    me on the U.S. support for the Contras. I had never heard of the Contras and
                    made light of his statements. Within two months, U.S. aid to the Contras was
                    commoknowledge. Although I engaged in public diplomacy on Central America for
                    another year or so, the best that the Department could provide as guidance on
                    the matter was that we could neither confirm nor deny the allegation that the
                    United States was supporting the Contras.</p>
                <p>I did that for about four or five months. Then, I was asked to be foreign policy
                    adviser on the U.S. delegation to Geneva on an International Telecommunications
                    Union negotiation, or rather, the western hemisphere region thereof. This was a
                    satellite communications negotiation, which markedly expanded the number of
                    channels that are available for all of the western hemisphere countries. The
                    negotiations lasted some six weeks and were successful. The communications
                    adviser to the Under Secretary reckoned the financial benefit to the United
                    States at $20 billion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time, you were working out of Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: Yes. At that time, I was working for Diana Lady Dugan, who was a special
                    assistant to the Under Secretary for Technology handling international
                    telecommunications affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then, you were assigned to the United Nations General
                        Assembl(UNGA) as a Latin American advisor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: When I returned from Geneva in August 1983, I was asked to be Latin
                    American advisor on the U.S. delegation to the United Nations General Assembly
                    meeting for that year.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Jean Kirkpatrick was our principal delegate in New York
                        then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: Jean Kirkpatrick was our permanent representative and had thtitle of
                    Ambassador to the United Nations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this work? What were your relations say with the
                        Bureau of Inter-American Affairs? Were they close or were there other
                        bureaus that got mixed up in it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: Each geographic bureau has its own man on the delegation, so I had a
                    number of regional counterparts on the delegation. There were a Senator and
                    Member of the House of Representatives on the delegation. Then, there were
                    several people representing the private sector. And, of course, Jean
                    Kirkpatrick, who was head of delegation, and several members of her staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Bureau of International Organizations? Did
                        theplay any part in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: Yes, they did, but they would deal with the permanent staff of the U.S.
                    mission to the United Nations, not with the regional advisors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now did you live in New York City at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: I stayed at a New York hotel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the principal issues you faced in your period at
                        the UN?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: The principal issue that came up, I think you might say, for the U.S.
                    Government and certainly for the Inter-American bureau, was the U.S. invasion of
                    Grenada.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. That was in October 1983, as I recall. Apparently
                        wwere beaten about the ears by a number of delegations on that one.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>BLAKE: Yes, we were roundly criticized for the remainder of that Assembly
                    meeting. It was rather interesting. As I recall, the coup d'�tat against the
                    Grenadian Government took place on a weekend or on an early Monday morning.
                    Certainly, when we got to the UN there was a great deal of snickering about it.
                    I wasn't aware until that time, but, apparently, the Grenadians were regarded as
                    an odd lot by others in the Caribbean community. Then, the coup leaders
                    assassinated over 20 - I want to say 24, but I may be wrong - persons. They were
                    principally leading figures in the Government the coup had overthrown, but they
                    also included persons from the Grenadian intelligentsia. It was clear they were
                    trying to wipe out the intelligentsia. At that point, the attitude of
                    ambassadors from other Caribbean countries changed. They really became quite
                    fearful. They recognized the Cuban hand behind the coup in Grenada and that
                    their countries might be next.</p>
                <p>At that moment, I had lunch with Bill Buffin. Bill was Assistant Secretary
                    General of the United Nations with responsibility for the General Assembly
                    meetings. He was a friend from our days in Bonn in the 1950s and had been
                    involved in United Nations work for most of his Foreign Service career. He
                    resigned after a tour as Ambassador to Beirut to become a top official at the
                    United Nations. Bill was disturbed by the developments in Grenada and wondered
                    why the United States didn't restore democracy as we had in the Dominican
                    Republic in the mid-1960s. I shared his view and said that I would raise the
                    point that weekend in Washington.</p>
                <p>That Saturday, I dropped by the Department to see people in the American
                    Republics Bureau. The Office Director for Caribbean Affairs was also concerned
                    and asked me to speak to the Office Director for regional policy. This was Luigi
                    Einaudi, and Luigi seemed unimpressed. I mentioned his disinterest to an old
                    friend who was a Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Bureau. He said that Luigi
                    took the position that Grenada was too unimportant to engage our interest, and
                    he suggested that I speak to Roger Fontaine, the Latin American Adviser on the
                    National Security Council. I telephoned him, and Roger asked me to come to the
                    NSC at once. He was extremely interested in my report on the concern I had
                    picked up in the UN corridors and said that it would be useful at a meeting he
                    was about to enter.</p>
                <p>I think it was early the next Tuesday morning when I received a phone call at my
                    hotel room from Bill Buffin. He wanted to know whether I had heard the morning
                    news. I replied that I hadn't yet turned on the radio, and Bill exclaimed,
                    “We've invaded Grenada. Good work.”Life was frantic after that. The
                    English-speaking Caribbean nations were jubilant. We later learned that Eugenia
                    Charles, as Head of the Caribbean Council, had asked for intervention, and the
                    British Government had issued a legal opinion that she had the constitutional
                    and regional authority to do so. However, the other hemispheric nations
                    expressed varying degrees of outrage that the United States would invade another
                    OAS member nation even to overthrow an illegitimate government. As we uncovered
                    large caches of Soviet weapons, which were clearly intended for use in other
                    Caribbean countries, they lowered their outcries against us but failed to
                    support us. The matter was discussed both in the General Assembly and the
                    Security Council, and the Soviet bloc became the principal critic of our action
                    in Grenada.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So in other words, the farther away from Grenada, the more
                        yocould criticize the U.S. presumably.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: Yes. With the exception of Great Britain and Germany, in Europe, and
                    Israel, most of the developed countries either sat on their hands or offered
                    only token support. The Soviet bloc led the opposition against us with
                    developing countries and, somewhat at a distance, the Latin American countries,
                    which, with the exception of Cuba, opposed us over time, more for historical
                    reasons than for opposition to the stifling of what was clearly Cuban and Soviet
                    attempted penetration of the Caribbean. We could always count on the
                    English-speaking Caribbean countries to support us. The problem was these are
                    very poor countries, and some of their ambassadors you might say were almost
                    like an honorary council, an honorary ambassador. I remember once a vote coming
                    up in the UNGA on our invasion of Grenada. I had to get in touch with the
                    Ambassador from St. Kitts and Nevis, and I discovered that he was a taxi driver.
                    I had a devil of a time running him down. I finally reached him by telephone. He
                    said, “What time do you think the vote will be?” I said, “Probably about 5:00 P.
                    M.” He protested, “Rush hour, that is my best business. How long is it going to
                    take? I can't afford to go off and make this vote.” I had to really lean on him
                    to get him to come back and vote.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd say it was an honest answer. Were you there for the
                        Falkland Islands dispute or was that gone?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: No, that was earlier. I was in Panama.</p>
                <p>If I may digress back to that, though. That was rather interesting. I was Charg�
                    d'Affaires at the time and got a message, a flash message from the Department
                    about 11:18 or 11:20. The message said that at 11:00 A.M. we are informing the
                    Latin American ambassadors of our plans to help the British. We want you to
                    advise the President instantly. I immediately telephoned President Royo and
                    passed on the message as an urgent advance notice. He replied rather coolly,
                    “Yes, I know. My Ambassador has already reported it to me. Embassies should have
                    had that message before the Department met with the ambassadors.” The Department
                    put all of us in an embarrassing position with the Governments to which we were
                    accredited.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, you know in moments like that, things get a little
                        confused, even in the Department. How about the troubles in Central America
                        we were going through at the time? Were they surfaced at the General
                        Assembly, for instance with Nicaragua, with the Contras, with El Salvador
                        and the fighting there.</hi>

                <p>BLAKE: They did, but they were overshadowed by Grenada. Then, I think too, the
                    relations with the Sandinistas had not bottomed. All of the real problems and
                    things that would have led to embarrassment to the United States did not become
                    truly public for another six months and were taken up by the UNGA in the fall of
                    1984.</p>

                <p>BLAKE: No. We were prepared for a number of these issues, but they never really
                    emerged, and they might have if it hadn't been for the dominant position of
                    Grenada. Also, the agenda for the General Assembly meetings has to include
                    matters of interest to all UN members, and there may simply not be sufficient
                    time to schedule every outstanding international dispute. Much of the
                    consideration of Grenada took place in venues other than the General Assembly.

                    which meets every year in the fall at the UN headquarters in New York City.</p>

                <p>BLAKE: The Department was in a very responsive mode, and they did do quite well.

                <p>BLAKE: Quite a bit. That, in fact, was the better part of my job. An issue would
                    come up for a vote, and it would be my responsibility to contact the Latin
                    American delegations. Upon occasion, for example, I met with the German and the
                    English delegations. I remember, in particular, times when there would be a
                    Latin American issue, and the person on our delegation who was responsible for
                    that contact, say with the German delegation, would not feel comfortable in
                    making a presentation of a Latin American issue, so he would ask me to do it for
                    him.</p>

                        thissues that arose there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: Not really, no. I returned to Washington and spent most of 1984 working on
                    public diplomacy with respect to Central America and, in particular, our support
                    for the anti-Sandinistas in Nicaragua. A political appointee, Otto Reich, was
                    put in charge of this activity while I was in New York. Otto is a Cuban-American
                    and staunchly conservative.Related to our opposition to the Sandinista
                    government in Nicaragua was our support for the government in El Salvador. We
                    took the position that communist takeovers in Central America would put pressure
                    on Guatemala and Mexico with the probability that millions of refugees would
                    flee to the United States. At times, various high officials, including President
                    Reagan, spoke of this concern. To my mind, the threat was overblown and the
                    manner in which we conducted public diplomacy amateurish. For example, even
                    though it had been common knowledge for a year that the United States was
                    supporting the Contras in their efforts to overthrow the Sandinista Government
                    and that Congress was debating the amount of aid to give the Contras, we were
                    told, when we traveled around the country on speaking engagements, that we could
                    neither confirm nor deny that there were Contras, much less that we supported
                    them.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>Nicaragua was, I fear, a subject that did not engage me. However, I was a strong
                    believer in the cause in El Salvador. The Government there was in a most
                    difficult position: The Salvadorian military really ran the show; atrocities
                    were numerous but committed by both sides; and the civilians were truly trying
                    to restore democracy. The Salvadorian Government called for national elections
                    in May 1984, and the United States sent an observer delegation. I was part of
                    it.</p>
                <p>The Salvadorian candidates were Duarte, a moderate whom the U.S. Government
                    favored, and d'Aubuisson, an extreme right-winger, presumably with ties to the
                    death squads. Our delegation arrived the day before elections, in time for a
                    briefing by the two candidates of all of the visiting observer delegations.
                    There must have been 50 delegations in all from the Western Hemisphere and
                    Europe. Most were official, but various political parties and interest groups
                    were there, as well. In fact, El Paso Mayor Cisneros sent two observers.</p>
                <p>Duarte came to the meeting with the observers and spent several hours answering
                    questions. D'Aubuisson declined to come, saying that the process was rigged;
                    also, he was likely unwilling to submit to the grilling he knew he would
                    experience.</p>
                <p>We observers spread throughout El Salvador the next day. With two other
                    Americans, I visited several village polling places about two hours from San
                    Salvador. It was wonderful to see the massive turnout. True, voting is mandatory
                    in El Salvador, and voters have a finger dipped in ink after they have cast
                    their ballot, as proof that they had voted and also, I suppose, to prevent them
                    from voting again. Balanced against this was the revolutionaries' threat to kill
                    voters or, at a minimum, to cut off the inked finger. Moreover, voters could
                    claim an exemption from voting if they were sick or if travel or other
                    conditions prevented them from getting to a polling place.</p>
                <p>Even without the requirement to vote, I think that there would have been a heavy
                    turnout, certainly by U.S. standards. I recall one case where we drove into a
                    village and decided to randomly speak to people waiting in line to vote. I
                    approached a young couple with a little girl about five years old. When I
                    reached them, I realized that the wife was nursing an infant. They told me that
                    they had walked two hours to get to the polling place, had been in line for an
                    hour already and expected that it would be another hour before they could vote,
                    and then were faced with a two-hour walk home in the middle of the day. I
                    suggested that they could have requested an exemption from voting and asked why
                    they made such effort to vote. The husband replied, “For God and my
                    country.”</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>The turnout was nearly 90 percent of the eligible voters. Duarte won. I came away
                    with the impression that it would take considerable upheaval to shake El
                    Salvador from the path to democracy. Despite considerable pressure from the
                    revolutionaries, the elections were without incident. Violence was surprisingly
                    low. As it happened, though, the helicopter carrying Tom Pickering, our
                    Ambassador, was shot at twice as he flew from one polling place to another. No
                    one on the helicopter was hurt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, when 1985 came, you were then sent to Bermuda
                        as acting Consul General, I believe. How did this move to Bermuda come
                        about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: Bermuda had traditionally been sort of a retirement post in the State
                    Department. In 1981, we had an officer there, John Owen. While he was there, a
                    fellow named Max Friedersdorf, who was in the White House as a liaison to the
                    Congress, took some Congressmen to a meeting on Bermuda. This is a meeting of
                    American and British parliamentarians that is held every other year. Max was
                    enchanted by Bermuda and persuaded President Reagan to name him as Consul
                    General to Bermuda. The rationale for it was that the Consul General on Bermuda
                    and, I believe, the Consul General in Hong Kong were the only two consular
                    officers that reported directly to the Department. All other consular offices
                    are constituent posts to embassies. It was argued that Bermuda was a quasi
                    embassy and, hence, suitable for a political appointee. Max got the job.</p>
                <p>Then, Max abruptly resigned in 1983 to take a position as Vice President of
                    Government Affairs for Pepsi Cola. In that capacity, Max was really working on
                    the re-election of Ronald Reagan in the 1984 elections. This cover was widely
                    known on Bermuda. It was probably illegal, which made it interesting because
                    Max, prior to his appointment to the White House, had been Vice Chairman of the
                    Federal Elections Commission. I had met Max in Panama when he came down in that
                    capacity to advise the Panamanian Government on the procedures for fair
                    elections.</p>
                <p>The Department detailed a succession of Foreign Service officers for two or three
                    months to Bermuda, and I was asked by the European Bureau to go to Bermuda for a
                    month in January 1985. Then, I was asked to stay for another month, then
                    another. Then in April, Herb Cohen, who was head of Personnel and a Deputy to
                    George Vest in the Director General's office, telephoned and said, “I want to
                    let you know that tomorrow you will be paneled to be assigned for two years as
                    Consul General to Bermuda.” I protested on the ground that it was the least
                    responsible job I had had in many years. He said, “Well, the White House is
                    putting on a great deal of pressure to name a political appointee, but we are
                    going to go to the mat with them. We intend to say that we have a senior officer
                    in Bermuda.” I replied, “Herb, the State Department never goes to the mat with
                    anyone, least of all the White House.”</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>Now, I didn't tell Herb that I had discovered a folder marked “Friedersdorf, Max,
                    personal. Please hold pending return” in the back of the Consul General's safe.
                    I knew what Max had in mind, and, sure enough, I was paneled, and in late August
                    or September, I got a personal message from the Under Secretary for Management
                    that there was an agreement between the State Department and the White House
                    that Max Friedersdorf would be returning to Bermuda. So, I came out in
                    November.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is really a low blow. Did you have any major
                        problemduring your months there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: No, although I found there was a lot to keep me amused and involved. For
                    example, I discovered that we had never sent a person under the Exchange of
                    Persons Program by United States Information Agency, from Bermuda to the United
                    States. So, I sent a number of Bermudans to the United States under that
                    program. The data for Bermuda show that each Bermudan takes 2.1 visits per year
                    to the United States. Those are people with money, and there are many people -
                    for example, those in the opposition political party, which is basically a black
                    and a working class party, and teachers and people of that sort - who had never
                    been to the United States or certainly had never been recognized by the U.S.
                    Government.</p>
                <p>I also learned that, in the 1970s, we had initialed an agreement under which we
                    would transfer land occupied but no longer required or used by the U.S. Navy to
                    Bermuda in exchange for a plot of land the Navy wanted to expand facilities at
                    the Naval Air Station. While the swap had been agreed to, it was never
                    consummated. Further, an Assistant Secretary of the Navy planned a trip to
                    Bermuda, and it coincided with a flap over atomic naval vessels making port
                    calls to members of the Commonwealth. At that particular moment, Australia had
                    refused to receive an atomic-powered vessel, and the Bermuda opposition was
                    applying pressure to have the Bermuda Government take a similar position.</p>
                <p>As the Bermuda Government was still interested in the land swap, it struck me
                    that we could use the Assistant Secretary's visit to deflect attention from the
                    atomic vessel issue by having him sign the agreement on the land swap. Funnily,
                    the State Department had lost sight of the land swap agreement, and it had never
                    been recorded by the British Foreign and Colonial Office. An officer who had
                    worked for me in Costa Rica was on detail to the Pentagon, and he found the
                    agreement in their files. He sent it to the Department, the Department got in
                    touch with the Foreign and Colonial Office, the Bermuda Premier got in touch
                    with London, and we were able to pull off the signing ceremony. The atomic issue
                    never came up.</p>

                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>BLAKE: No, never. We never had that problem. Bermuda has one of the best police
                    systems I have ever known anywhere. It is clear that they learned their lessons
                    from the British well. Nor was there any money laundering through Bermuda. We
                    had an informal arrangement to cover that. I would say that Bermudans combine
                    the better qualities of the British and the Swiss: discretion, respect for law
                    and order, the ability to work informally and with respect for confidentiality,
                    and quite, good taste.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: No particular difficulty, and I had a number of people come from high
                    positions in government. Secretary of State George Schultz visited once, as did
                    Secretary of Commerce Baldridge. Jean Kirkpatrick visited Bermuda shortly after
                    she left the United Nations. Alan Greenspan came as a consultant to one of the
                    Bermuda banks before he became Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. We had a
                    number of Members of Congress on the Island, most notably Senator Bob Packwood.
                    The Consul General's residence had a separate guesthouse, and officials from the
                    White House and a number from the Department had no hesitancy in inviting
                    themselves to be our guests. Then, there were visitors from outside the Federal
                    Government, for example, the Governor of New Jersey brought over about a hundred
                    policemen who were being honored, the Hasty Pudding Club from Harvard, and so
                    on. And then, we had several U.S. naval visits, in particular the Blue Angels
                    flying team and the U.S.S. Eisenhower, an atomic-powered aircraft carrier.</p>
                <p>I found that I could get mileage out of most of these visitors. To my surprise,
                    at Bermuda I had a larger representational fund than the entire Embassy in
                    Panama had while I was there. I found that I could use these visitors in
                    representational functions. Two examples come to mind. It had been traditional
                    for the Consul General to give a cocktail party, to which prominent Bermudans
                    were invited, when the Hasty Pudding Club visited Bermuda. The logic was that a
                    number of the guests would have gone to Harvard. I decided to invite a different
                    group, namely, the class officers of the student body and the senior class of
                    all the high schools on Bermuda, as well as Harvard graduates. And, the function
                    was a noontime picnic with volleyball, etc. on the residence grounds near the
                    beach. Although it was a bit cold at the time, the kids loved it.</p>
                <p>For Secretary Baldridge, I gave a stag dinner and discovered that, by
                    coincidence, one of the American guests had been a close friend of Baldridge
                    while they were in college. This dinner took a perverse turn. In the
                    after-dinner talk, Baldridge extensively criticized the State Department for
                    never helping American businessmen abroad. This surprised the American guests as
                    I hosted a monthly breakfast for the American business community for an exchange
                    of views. Baldridge dropped his remarks when I suggested this was not the place
                    to air any differences he had with State.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>Funnily, three months later, Tish Baldridge, his sister, visited Bermuda. She had
                    been Social Secretary to both Ambassador Claire Booth Luce in Rome and Jackie
                    Kennedy when she was First Lady. We had a small party for her, and she was a
                    gracious guest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After that in November of '85...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: I returned to the Department. I was still over compliment. I was asked to
                    do economic studies; one had apparently been requested by Secretary Schultz.
                    That was the study of the economic function in the Foreign Service. It came out
                    of his concern of how economic reporting was used, how economic responsibilities
                    were handled, and so on. I never saw a memorandum from George Schultz asking for
                    this. Apparently, he had raised it at a meeting of his principal officers, and
                    had asked for it from his Assistant Secretary for Intelligence and Research.
                    Intelligence and Research Bureau never did it. I think about a year had gone by,
                    and, all of a sudden, Schultz had said where is my economic study, and
                    everything went into a crash mode. I was asked to do this for INR but without
                    any guidance whatsoever about what they wanted. In a sense, I was trying to
                    divine what the Secretary wanted.</p>
                <p>I did review the economic function as it was performed. In doing this, I saw that
                    two very good economists, two very good officers, my old friend Bob Sayre and
                    also Ernest Preeg, had also done this same study in the past. Looking into the
                    background, I found that even more studies had been done, so I was a little bit
                    unclear as to what was wanted. Bob Sayre's work was probably the definitive work
                    on it. There was really no need in doing anything other than just implementing
                    what Bob had suggested.</p>
                <p>Rather than re-plowing ground that had already been so ably covered, I took a
                    somewhat different approach and dealt with the question of how economic officers
                    and the reports they submitted were used by the Federal Government and
                    businesses. This led to consideration of leadership in the Department and
                    leadership positions to which officers with an economic background were
                    assigned. In doing this, I discovered that 70% of the career officers who are
                    ambassadors came out of the political cone. I forget exactly, but about five or
                    six percent came out of the consular and administrative cones, and the rest were
                    out of the economic cone. There were no data on the Deputy Chiefs of Mission
                    (DCMs). as no records were kept on the background of officers at the DCMlevel.
                    Short of taking each and every DCM and going back and checking on his/her cone,
                    there was no way to develop data, and there was not time for that. The
                    Department's Office of Personnel speculated that career ambassadors tended to
                    choose DCMs of their own background. Anecdotal evidence supported that view. No
                    matter how you wanted to cut it, political officers dominated. Economic officers
                    were clearly a distinct minority at the top of our diplomatic missions
                    abroad.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>I expressed the view in the report to the Secretary that the international
                    problems that the government had to deal with were switching from the military
                    and political field over time into the economic field. Economics would be even
                    more important in the future, and I came out with a plug for more economic
                    officers in leading positions. To my mind, the Department did not recognize the
                    asset it had in economic officers and the changing international world in which
                    they could play a useful part. Other Federal agencies recognized and used the
                    talent which the State Department ignored. I discovered, for example, that the
                    chief economist at AID, the chief economist at the Export-Import Bank, and the
                    head of the Commerce Department's Foreign Commercial Service were Foreign
                    Service officers who had come back from their posts overcompliment and were
                    detailed to other agencies because the State Department could not find positions
                    for them in the Department or abroad. It seemed to me that there was a mind set
                    in the Department that failed to recognize the importance of economics. I might
                    say, that when I say economics, I also include commercial activity, not just
                    financial or macro economic reporting or matters of that sort.When I sent the
                    paper around for clearance before sending it to the Secretary, the person who
                    was my contact in the Office of General Counsel refused to sign off on it
                    because, as she put it, there was no reason for the State Department to pander
                    to the business community. I had to raise the problem with the Deputy Counsel
                    General to get clearance. It wasn't pandering to the business community; it was
                    taking into account that there is a very large American business community
                    abroad with legitimate claims on the State Department, just as tourists,
                    permanent U.S. residents abroad, and so on have a claim on the Department.</p>
                <p>Even so, the report languished for months in INR before it finally went up to
                    George Schultz who accepted it. He then sent back a message saying, “What can we
                    do to implement? What can we do to change things around?” I started work on
                    that. At that point, however, I reached the end of my career and retired on
                    September 30, 1987.</p>
                <p>In addition to working on these reports, I also served on various committees and
                    boards in my last two years. Much of this work seemed “busy work” of little
                    consequence, and I no longer recall the subject matter. In 1986 and again in
                    1987, I wrote evaluations of Foreign Service officers detailed outside the
                    Department of State to the White House, the offices of members of Congress,
                    other Federal Departments, and around the country to state offices. In 1987, I
                    visited Europe to write evaluations of Foreign Service officers assigned as
                    political advisers to commanding generals of major military commands. This
                    responsibility gave me the opportunity to meet Bud McFarlane and John
                    Poindexter, both National Security Advisers to President Reagan, and Larry
                    Speakes, Reagan's press spokesman. In general, I found that non-State senior
                    people held the Foreign Service in high regard but also could be more candid in
                    their assessment of the competence of the persons detailed to their staffs than
                    many of the rating officers on efficiency reports I read while serving on a
                    promotion board.</p>

                        the foreign affairs field. After that experience, Mel, what are your

                        it to young people? Do you see it with the same eye as you did in 1951?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: I would highly recommend it. There is absolutely nothing like the Foreign
                    Service. It is a most rewarding form of work. I just can't praise it too highly.
                    I think that my career shows that a Foreign Service officer deals with matters
                    of great importance and significance to his country, yet one is seldom bored and
                    often quite amused. Many friends say they would not recommend it to their young
                    friends or children, but I don't feel that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any final observations on your career or not,
                        youexperiences?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLAKE: Let me return to the matter raised by Secretary Baldridge. Over the years,
                    I heard time and again that the Foreign Service did not support business. That
                    was never my experience. I don't recall an Embassy or a consular post where the
                    chief was not open to the business community. That does not mean that they, or
                    anyone else, could do everything asked of them. But I can assure you that the
                    concerns of U.S. business abroad were uppermost in our minds.</p>
                <p>I always tried to be responsive to business. My first overseas post where I had
                    exclusively economic/commercial responsibilities was San Jose in 1963-65. At
                    that post, I developed the practice of meeting informally several times a year
                    with American business leaders, usually for lunch at my home. I did the same
                    thing in Frankfurt, Panama, and Bermuda. Ambassador Davis and I spent
                    considerable time with American bankers in Switzerland. While I was on the Swiss
                    desk in Washington in 1967, I assisted the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in
                    establishing the first American Chamber of Commerce to cover all of Switzerland.
                    When I first met Ambassador Moss in Washington before going to Panama, he asked
                    me whether I had any thoughts on our prospective post. I mentioned that I had
                    reviewed the Embassy reporting for the previous two years and came away with the
                    impression that it had minimal contact with the U.S. business community,
                    probably because of its concentration on the Canal Treaty negotiations. Further,
                    I noted that, in Latin America, only Panama and Paraguay were without an
                    American Chamber of Commerce, and I wondered at the lack thereof. This struck a
                    responsive chord, and he suggested that I speak to Keith Micelli at the U.S.
                    Chamber. Keith gave me some materials on establishing an American Chamber in
                    Latin America, and I was able to encourage the establishment of a Panama Chamber
                    my first year there.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>You can see that Baldridge struck a nerve. But, it goes deeper than that. As I
                    mentioned earlier, the Foreign Service Act of 1946 established a Foreign Service
                    for the entire Federal Government. Congress did not intend that it be the
                    overseas arm of just the State Department. In fact, Commerce and Agriculture had
                    their own overseas services until they were quashed for budgetary reasons during
                    the interwar period. In the 1950s, the Agriculture Department did secure
                    legislation to establish the foreign Agriculture Service. Secretary of State
                    Dulles was content to have it this way, as he saw no place in foreign policy for
                    agriculture. He soon recognized that, as Kissinger put it, foreign policy is a
                    seamless weave; you can't put foreign policy sectors in separate boxes and
                    consider them out of context. Gene Boster was a staff aide to Secretary Dulles
                    in the late 1950s, and he told me that Dulles once confided that he had made a
                    mistake in letting Agriculture go and would not repeat it. At that time,
                    Commerce was fighting to regain its own service.</p>
                <p>Commerce did get its Foreign Commercial Service in 1980. Friends at the U.S.
                    Chamber of Commerce have told me that the Chamber supported the establishment of
                    the Foreign Commercial Service but later regretted it. More recently, other
                    responsibilities have been taken from State, in particular the responsibility
                    for trade negotiations. The result has been a tremendous increase in overall
                    administrative and logistic costs for the Federal Government, an unsupportable
                    increase in interagency committees and so on, and a diminution of concentration
                    on development of comprehensive foreign policy initiatives. It's a gloomy scene,
                    but perhaps the pendulum is about to swing back. The return, for example, of the
                    United States Information Agency, arms control, and disarmament to the State
                    Department are moves in the right direction. Perhaps, we can hope that reason
                    will prevail, and State will regain more of the trade and commercial
                    responsibilities.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, we have a generation of State and Foreign Service officers who do
                    not know how it was before commercial activities and trade negotiations were
                    taken from State, and they see foreign policy against a backdrop of a State
                    Department that has traditionally looked down on economic and commercial work.
                    I'm thinking of the way State turned down the offer of the Treasury
                    international staff in the late 1940s and the young lawyer who made the
                    “pandering to business” comment. But, I am basically an optimist and hope that
                    the Foreign Service will regain its earlier status and be what Harold Nicholson
                    called the world's best diplomatic service.</p>
