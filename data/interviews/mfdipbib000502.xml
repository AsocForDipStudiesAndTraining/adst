                <p>AMBASSADOR SMITH HEMPSTONE, JR.</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: May 6, 1998</p>
                <p>Copyright 2000 ADST</p>
                <p>Q: This is an interview with Ambassador Smith Hempstone, Jr. This is being done
                    on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training and I'm Charles
                    Stuart Kennedy. To begin with, could you tell me when and where you were born
                    and something about your family?</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: I was born in a place called Washington, DC, in 1929. My father was a
                    career naval officer. His family was from upper Montgomery Country for the past
                    nearly 300 years. My mother's family, the Noyes, came originally from Maine. My
                    maternal great-grandfather moved down here about 1840 and was one of the
                    founders of The Washington Star, of which my grandfather was the editor and
                    publisher. I grew up in various parts of the United States as a Navy junior:
                    Annapolis, Maryland; Newport, Rhode Island, and Coronado, California.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When were you in Annapolis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: We were there twice during my father's period of active duty. He was
                    commissioned in 1911 and retired in 1945. We were there at the time of my birth.
                    I would have been born in Annapolis, except my maternal grandmother was dying of
                    cancer here in Washington, so my mother, who was then pregnant with me, came up
                    to look after her and I was born here. Then we went back for the second time
                    when my father was supply officer at the Academy in 1942. We were there until
                    1945 when he retired.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you educated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: When I started going to school, we were up in Newport and then I went
                    to school in Coronado, California, for two or three years. We came back here in
                    1938 and I went to St. Albans. I attended St. Albans until 1943, which was my
                    freshman year in high school, at which point I went out to Culver Military
                    Academy, from which I graduated in 1946.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you thinking of a career in the Navy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Yes, and certainly my father was thinking of the Navy for me. He used
                    to say that he and my mother would walk by Bancroft Hall and he would look up
                    there and say, “I wonder which room Smith will have one of these days.” But
                    sending me to Culver was the coup de grace for that. My counselor advised me
                    that if I pursued a career in the military, I would be courtmarshalled within
                    five years, and that was probably right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were at Culver, what type of academics and
                        sports weryou interested in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Like most boys of that age (15-17), I was interested in all sports. I
                    was not much interested in academics. I was always good in history and English
                    and always terrible in sciences and mathematics, which was another good reason
                    not to go to the Naval Academy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you looking at the newspaper world at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: That was the sort of second obvious thing. If I wasn't going to go
                    into the military, then I had lots of family in the newspaper business, all of
                    them at The Star. So, I did have that in mind when I got out of the Marine
                    Corps. I was in the Marines during Korea. I got in the officer program while at
                    college at the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee. I was commissioned
                    in 1950, which is when the invasion took place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A good time to get into the Marines.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Yes, as a 21 year old single second lieutenant, I was rameat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To go back a bit, I'm just a year older than you, so we
                        sort ogrew up at the same time. Did World War II play a big role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk a little about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Sure. In the first place, all of our family, with one exception, were
                    in the military. I had one brother-in-law who was 4F and he was an opera singer.
                    My father, who said to him one day (My father had a good sense of humor), “Well,
                    Garfield, what are you going to do during the war?” He said, “Well, Dad, I
                    thought I might go into OSS.” My father looked at him and said, “You couldn't be
                    a spy, Garfield.” He said, “Why not?” He said, “They couldn't get you up at dawn
                    to shoot you.” My one brother was an officer in the Army. I had two other
                    brothers-in-law. One was an officer in the Marines and the other was an officer
                    in the Navy. I had a cousin who was a Marine enlisted man. I had another cousin
                    who was Navy enlisted. So, it was a very exciting time for me. I kept a diary
                    every day of what happened.</p>
                <p>Q: For our generation, it was the greatest geography lesson in the world. I could
                    tell where Rostock was, and Civarani, and these places that just tripped off our
                    tongues.</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: When I was 14 or 15, I dutifully stood out on Garfield Street with a
                    tin hat on looking for German air raiders. I was a fire watcher.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I spotted a Luftwaffe at the top of the Hotel Annapolis.
                        FroCulver, you went to the University of the South. Why there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: I didn't go directly there. I went to George Washington for a year. I
                    didn't much like George Washington for two reasons. One, it was a streetcar
                    college, no campus or anything. Two, I was living at home in Bethesda, which was
                    not my idea of what to do. I'm a Episcopalian and Sewanee is Episcopalian. So, I
                    had heard of Sewanee. One of my best friends was going down there, Maurice
                    Heartfield. He said to me once, “Come on down to Sewanee with me.” I couldn't
                    think of any reason not to, so I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your major at Sewanee?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: History.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any particular part of history?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Not really. I took ancient history, American history,Europe since
                    1815, a little light on the Asian history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think Asian history was pretty light for everyone in
                        thosdays. Lots of African history?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: No. I don't think we even had anything that might be described as
                    colonial history aside from American history. As I say, I always did well in
                    that and I always did well in English, in writing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you joined the Marine ROTC [Reserve Officers
                        TraininCourse], what was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: This was a platoon leaders class, which was a very good program, good
                    from a taxpayer's point of view, good for the Marine's point of view, and good
                    from the guy's point of view because it cost absolutely nothing and it laid no
                    obligations on you. You went to Quantico two summers, the first summer as a
                    corporal and the second summer as a sergeant. It was a glorified boot camp. When
                    you graduated from college, you were offered a commission in the Reserves, which
                    you either could or could not take, and I took mine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then we come to June 25, 1950, which is the date many of
                        us alremember. What happened with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: As it happened, I was in Europe at that time. In those days (It may be
                    the same now), if you were a Reserve officer, you had to get the Marine Corps'
                    permission, a pro forma thing, to leave the country. I had done that and had
                    permission to leave the country. I didn't receive any communication from them
                    while I was in Europe, nor did my father. So, I just went ahead and finished the
                    summer trip and then came home. My father, in his usual brusk manner, said,
                    “Well, are you going to volunteer or are you going to wait until they come and
                    grab you?” I said, “Well, if you put it that way, I suppose I'll go down.” So, I
                    went over to Arlington Hall and said, “I'm Hempstone. I've been out of the
                    country.” They said, “Oh, yes,” and they got the box down. This was before
                    computers. Everything was on 3x5 cards. They said, “We never would have gotten
                    you if you hadn't come in.” I said, “Thanks a lot. Well, when can I expect to be
                    called up?” They said, “Not immediately because we've got a big backdraft.” I
                    said, “Could you promise me that I'd have time to do one semester at the
                    University of Virginia [UVA] in graduate school?” They said, “Oh, yes, no
                    problem.” So, I went down to the UVA and the Woodrow Wilson School. Of course, I
                    got my orders at Thanksgiving time, so I had wasted my time. I had a good time
                    at Virginia. I can't complain about that. I went in on active duty the first of
                    January 1951.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do in the Marines?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Like all brand-new 21 year old single second lieutenants, I was an
                    O301, an infantry officer. But on the way out, we were given a chance to state
                    some preference. I said, “I think I'd kind of like to be in amtracks (light
                    armored vehicles, crossing rivers).” In the first place, I wouldn't have to
                    walk. They said, “Okay,” so I was down for amtracks. But we arrived right in the
                    middle of a big offensive, the next to last big offensive that the Marines had
                    trying to straighten the line out. We had lost tons of forward observers, at
                    least half of them. So, they said, “Okay, all you guys whose names start with
                    “H” are now artillery officers,” which caused me some trepidation because I had
                    slept through the lectures on artillery and hadn't been to Fort Sill or anything
                    like that. But I became an artillery forward observer serving with the Second
                    Battalion of the 11th Marines.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Korean War?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: What did I know? I was a 21 year old kid. I always felt that we could
                    have won it with two more divisions. It's probably not true, but that's how we
                    felt. I never had any fear of those guys, the North Koreans and the Chinese,
                    which I suppose again shows how stupid we were. It was like most wars. It was
                    boring most of the time and terrifying for the rest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you leave Korea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: I was there from May of 1951 until April of 1952. Artillery officers
                    had to spend one month more than infantry officers. I believe infantry officers
                    spent 10 months, so I think we spent 11.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By that time, were you released from duty?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: I was posted to headquarters battalion in Quantico. Headquarters
                    battalion was composed entirely, aside from myself and a few others, of officers
                    and enlisted men awaiting court marshall. It was very entertaining. I suppose I
                    was there for four months. It was very boring. I thought, “Well, maybe I can get
                    out a little early.” I think my commitment was two years. But they were eager to
                    get rid of people, so I applied for early release and I got it and was released
                    in September or October. I was offered a regular commission, which I told them I
                    would take if they'd let me stay overseas. I liked the Marine Corps overseas in
                    the field, but I didn't like all the spit-and- polish at Quantico and Parris
                    Island.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You got out in 1952. Did you have any idea what you were
                        gointo do by that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: I thought, for lack of any other better idea, that I'd give the
                    newspaper business a try. I got a job with the Associated Press (AP), which was
                    a good teacher, in Charlotte, North Carolina. $42.50 a week. That extra $2.50
                    was for working the lobster shift at night. Again, that wasn't terribly
                    interesting. I was doing rewrite, basically sports. I wasn't a reporter.
                    Charlotte was the center that handled all the stuff from both the Carolinas and
                    we put it on the wire. I could barely type at the time. I had eight deadlines a
                    day, one an hour. I was the only non-union member in the shop.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the traditional hard boiled editor who was
                        alwaypounding on your head and telling you how to write?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Sure. I don't know whether they have that sort of editor anymore. I
                    won't say that the bureau chief was a great one because I don't think he was.
                    But I soon left there. I didn't stay very long. I stayed about six months. I
                    wanted to go someplace else. My brother was on The Star here in Washington. He
                    had met the city editor of the Louisville Times at a seminar in New York. He
                    said, “Why don't you go talk to him. I'll give Ed O'Neill a call.” So, I went up
                    to see him on my weekend off. They had nothing for me, but O'Neill said he would
                    let me know when they did. I didn't expect to ever hear anything more from him.
                    Since I wasn't able to develop a job from AP in Charlotte, I went up to New York
                    to conquer the world. I called on Time and Newsweekand Esquire and all of those.
                    People were very nice to me in those days, nicer than they are today. I talked
                    to a lot of good editors, all of whom gave me the same message: “Go back where
                    you came from and get some experience.” I was just about to go on veterans'
                    compensation, which I don't think my father would have liked much, when a job
                    offer came from the Louisville Times. I went down to Louisville.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you were working for the Louisville Times from when to
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: I guess we're talking about 1953. I was prettlight-footed in those
                    days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you stay long?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: No. I enjoyed The Louisville Times. I had a good time there. I was
                    doing reporting there, which is what I wanted to do, and writing and everything.
                    I got a merit raise and everything was going fine. But I had a girl I was
                    interested in up here and my hormones were fairly active in those days. So, I
                    got myself a job on The National Geographic. I came up and went to work for
                    them. That was very pleasant. The Geographic had nice people and it was fairly
                    lush. They paid a huge amount of money. I think I got $100 a week or something
                    like that, whereas I had been making $60 in Louisville. But again, it wasn't too
                    interesting. I was doing rewrite, rewriting other people's stuff. Because of my
                    family's interest in The Star, it was pretty certain unless somebody was really
                    mad at me, that I could get a job there when I wanted. I decided it was about
                    time to play The Star card. So, I went over to The Star, this being 1955. I got
                    married to the same lady. I worked for The Star from 1955 to 1956. I had a good
                    enough time at The Star, although working for a paper which your family owns a
                    bit of is not all a bowl of cherries. People think anything you get you got
                    because of that. On the other hand, I was once denied a raise that my boss put
                    me in for because another member of the family who was sort of a running mate of
                    mine didn't get one. So, I thought, “Am I going to be tied to this guy
                    forever?”</p>
                <p>I then got a fellowship from the Institute of Current World Affairs, which in
                    those days was based in New York. It still exists, but it's based in Hanover,
                    New Hampshire. The Institute was a small foundation and it was basically run by
                    one guy named Walter Rogers. In other words, there were no committees or forms
                    to fill out. If Rogers liked the cut of your jib, you got a fellowship; if he
                    didn't, you didn't. It was as simple as that. I wanted to go overseas. After a
                    certain amount of bickering, meeting other former fellows and so forth, it was
                    agreed that I should go to the Horn of Africa for two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: This was 1956.</p>
                <p>Q: This was about two years before the discovery of Africa which happened in the
                    United States. I say that facetiously. It came on our radar all of a sudden.
                    What prompted you towards there and particularly the Horn of Africa?</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: For one, in my age group in the newspaper business, everyone who had
                    literary pretensions, which was almost everybody, it seems, worshiped Ernest
                    Hemingway. I had met Ernest Hemingway in Italy in 1954. This is in the book, by
                    the way. He said, “Ever been to East Africa?” I said, “No.” He said, “Do you
                    speak Swahili?” I said, “No, I don't speak Swahili?” He said, “Well, you'd like
                    it. It's a man's country. Good hunting, good fishing, good writing. Go there
                    sometime.” So, I guess I squirreled that away in the back of my head. I read
                    Robert Ruark. We always had on one part of the family an overseas tradition in
                    that my father had been posted in Haiti, China, and so forth. I didn't have any
                    fears about going overseas. Also, our family situation here was a little close
                    because we had both of my parents here and my wife's parents. So, I sometimes
                    say facetiously that I went to Africa so I could be 8,000 miles away from my
                    wife's parents.</p>
                <p>Q: That's what Africa was designed for a great number of generations. The British
                    sent their escapees or their remittance men. Could you describe what the Horn of
                    Africa meant at that time?</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: That meant, to me at any rate, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya,
                    Zanzibar, and Uganda. But I didn't stay there. A wonderful thing about the
                    Institute, which was a small outfit of maybe eight fellows, which was started by
                    Crane, the Chicago plumbing mogul whose name you've seen on toilets. I think my
                    money came from Ford. I don't know when I decided not to stay in East Africa. I
                    loved East Africa. I loved Kenya. I thought I had died and gone to heaven. But I
                    decided I wanted a broader stream than that. We were traveling by road in a
                    Chevrolet Suburban carry-all, which was not four-wheel drive, but had pretty
                    good clearance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a big thing. I used to travel around Yugoslavia in
                        one othose things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: We drove all the way around Africa, 60,000 miles from Masawa to Cape
                    Town to Dakar. I had a one year extension on my fellowship to make it three
                    years and then I told Mr. Rogers that I would like to put a book together. He
                    said, “Fine” and gave me a fourth year, which was not unusual in the Institute.
                    They tended to run four, five, even six years. We produced a number of
                    ambassadors: Philips Talbot, Dick Nolte, who was briefly in Egypt, and so forth.
                    So, we went back to Kenya in 1960 and lived around the countryside, not in
                    Nairobi. During that time, I was basically working on the book, which was called
                    Africa, Angry Young Giant. I was doing some Institute newsletters and some
                    newspaper stuff also.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While we're on this period of about 1956-1960, what was
                        youimpression of particularly Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia, Uganda, and
                        all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Of course, this was the colonial period. It was difficult, not
                    impossible, to get to know Africans on any sort of intimate basis. I suppose
                    they were fundamentally distrustful of all whites. This began to change when the
                    nationalist movement got going and the nationalists were eager to get press.
                    Ethiopia I found fabulously interesting mainly because of the history of the
                    place and the personality of the Emperor and all that sort of thing. I always
                    liked the Somalis myself. They were quick, intelligent, never forget an insult,
                    quick with a knife, all that sort of thing, dirt poor. I guess they didn't have
                    anything more than bananas. Kenya was paradise to me. The wildlife - I am or was
                    a hunter. There was good hunting and fishing. Interesting, nice people, both
                    black, white, and brown. But a difficult time. For instance, when we went to
                    rent a guest house in Nairobi from a guy who became one of my best friends, I
                    said to him, “Graham, I'm a newspaper man and it will be necessary for me to
                    entertain people of color. Is that okay?” “No, you can't do it.” I said, “Okay,
                    it's your house.” So, I didn't hold that against him in any way, but that is the
                    way the attitude was. He later became a Kenyan citizen. I considered up until I
                    left Kenya buying a place out there and staying there once I got too old.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With Ethiopia, what was your impression of the rule of
                        thEmperor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: It was very clear because of what they called the “Shifta,” later
                    Eritrean liberation forces, that Eritrea was very unhappy with the Emperor's
                    rule. People didn't really hide that too much, although they had to be careful.
                    In Ethiopia itself, I didn't get that impression, but that may have been because
                    I didn't speak any of the languages I could have spoken with the common people.
                    I was dealing with people who were mainly the Emperor's kinsmen or allies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's move down to Somalia. It used to be British Somalia.
                        Werthey getting ready to become independent?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Yes, I think independence came in 1960. It was clear that Somalia,
                    former Italian Somalia, didn't have much use for the Italians. Things were a
                    little different in British Somaliland. Of course, there were not settlers there
                    in British Somaliland, just administrators.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about in Kenya? When did the Mau Mau war go on and
                        wherwas it when you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: It really began in 1952. The emergency lasted from 1952 to 1960. It
                    was pretty much over by 1955. It was always confined to the Kikuyu, Embu, and
                    Meroe homelands. They could not come out to Nairobi to work. Whites were allowed
                    in, although not in all areas. But you could go through there and stay at the
                    hotels in Nanyuki and Tiau, and so forth. As I said, that was pretty much over
                    by 1954-1955.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>Q: You were saying that because of the language and society, you were pretty well
                    limited to the official contact. They were getting ready at this time to move
                    toward independence. What was your impression of the colonial class there at
                    that time?</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: It varied enormously if you're talking about officials. You had people
                    like Dick Turnbull (Sir Richard Turnbull), who was Chief Secretary and ended up
                    as Governor of Tanzania and then of Aden. He was a first-rate guy, a world-class
                    administrator and man and everything else. He had a lot of guys who were pretty
                    so-and- so. Many of them had come out during Mau Mau, had been recruited. They
                    had been in the police during Mau Mau and had gone into colonial service. They
                    were not up to that mark. Many of them were quite mediocre.</p>
                <p>Q: The problem is always when you do recruit police types, you're talking about
                    people who are efficient in their field, but when they move beyond it, cultural
                    niceties aren't necessarily an arrow in their quiver.</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: That's right in most cases, although I knew at least one outstanding
                    policeman there who later had a very good career with the oil companies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling when the country gained independence.
                        Yowere there just before this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: And after it. Most of the farmers, the settlers, were shocked that it
                    came so quickly. I don't know why they were so shocked because I could certainly
                    see that and I told them so. They said, “No, no, in 10 or 15 years. I'm ready
                    for it.” It wasn't the point that they were ready for it. It was clearly coming.
                    Most of those who couldn't stomach it, couldn't accept a black government, and
                    that includes almost the entire Afrikaner population, left pretty quickly. That
                    was a good thing that they did leave because they would have been unhappy and
                    they would have made other people unhappy. Those who elected to stay had varying
                    degrees of loyalty to Kenya. The first cut that divided them was those who
                    retained their British citizenship and those who became Kenyan citizens. The
                    Kenyan citizens are mostly still there. There are just a couple thousand. I
                    think the whites who decided to stay said, “Well, let's muck in and see if we
                    can't make the damn thing work.” They were helped by Kenyatta in those days, who
                    was very reasonable.</p>
                <p>Q: Had he been released by this point?</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Yes, he was released in 1961, became Prime Minister in 1962, and
                    President of independent Kenya in 1963.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you develop any different sense during this 60,000 mile trip around
                    Africa? Was the whole area sort of gearing up for becoming independent at that
                    time?</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Yes, I would say so. We're talking about British Africa. The Congo was
                    not gearing up and French Africa was not gearing up, although De Gaulle gave it
                    to all of them in 1960. But nobody was geared up.</p>
                <p>Q: You say you were doing some newspaper work. Did you find that you were able to
                    place pieces? Was interest beginning to build up in the United States during
                    this period?</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Initially, there was not much interest in 1956. When I went overseas
                    (I was allowed to do this under the terms of the fellowship), I wrote to 100
                    newspapers and I told them what I was going to be doing. I said, “Would you be
                    interested in receiving articles on spec [on speculation]. It wouldn't cost them
                    anything unless they used it. If they did use it, it would be the massive sum of
                    $25.00 an occasional article?” Out of the 100, eight said “Yes.” This doesn't
                    indicate very strong interest. Then there did come a period right about 1960
                    where Africa had a certain vogue for a while.</p>
                <p>Q: Oh, yes, this was red hot stuff. I might add that you have written a book
                    called “Rogue Ambassador,” published in November 1997. Your views are rather
                    strong about the Foreign Service. Did you have much contact with our rather
                    sparse representation in Africa at that time?</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: I always called on the embassy, at least, initially during my first
                    visit and talked to the political officer, the economic officer, and usually in
                    those days the ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Most of them were consulate generals at that point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Right. They were all helpful to me in those days. Also at that time
                    there was a degree of cooperation, which would probably be considered scandalous
                    today, between the CIA and newspaper men. I had many CIA contacts around the
                    countryside.</p>

                        Therwasn't any information. There really wasn't much of a network
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: I don't think anybody ever told me anything that was of vital security
                    importance. I don't know whether I told them anything that hadn't been or
                    wouldn't be in the newspapers.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Yes.</p>

                        Higapartheid? Early apartheid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: It was right at the end of Malan's period. He was the first Afrikaner
                    Prime Minister. If my memory serves me correctly, he was followed by Strijdom.
                    Strijdom was a very tough guy. Apartheid was just in the period of its
                    codification. Most of those laws existed before either as single bits of
                    legislation or simply as practice. What the National Party did was to codify
                    them all, engrave them in stone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling when you went through there, your
                        first look at the situation? Was this something that was going to last? This
                        was before the Civil Rights Movement. You had gone to Sewanee and grown up
                        in the Navy and Washington, DC. So, we had both experienced segregation, so
                        this wasn't that unique. How did you see this when you got there the first
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: I found it pretty bad in the urban areas. For instance, it no longer
                    exists, but there was a black slum in the middle of Johannesburg known as
                    Sofiatown. While it was a slum, it was a place where Africans could own
                    property, which was very important to them. That was where Archbishop
                    Huddleston, who just died the other day, lived and worked. Through him and
                    through my newspaper contacts in the South African press, I had many contacts in
                    places like Sofiatown. I broke the law many times, which probably came back to
                    haunt me because there was a period where I couldn't get into South Africa. I
                    spent the night in Sofiatown in some guy's house. Just drinking with him was
                    against the law. One guy that I knew pretty well said, “When the night with the
                    long knives comes, we will have to cut your throat, too.” I said, “Well, I'm
                    glad you told me that.” Nothing personal.</p>
                <p>In the countryside, the Africans really were at such a primitive level. Literacy
                    was quite low in the countryside. There wasn't any nationalist activity to
                    exacerbate relations between the two races. Relations could be pretty good. For
                    all you can say about the Afrikaners (and you could say a lot bad about them
                    because they were tough on the Africans), they were at least open with them,
                    which the British South Africans frequently weren't. They were hypocritical.
                    They would complain about the Afrikaners themselves and about apartheid: “Well,
                    we never created this sort of thing.” Well, they believed in apartheid just as
                    firmly as the Dutch did. So, many of the Afrikaners got along well with the
                    Africans. When we lived in Tiumauo, Kenya, we had an Afrikaner policeman there,
                    a very good officer who got along beautifully with Africans.</p>

                        werreally beginning to pop. Did you want to play on this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Oh, yes, I left there with the intention of coming right back. I was
                    on a leave of absence from The Star during this time and I went back to talk to
                    them about what I might be doing. They said, “We've got a big job for you. We
                    want you to cover Africa and Latin America out of Washington.” It was
                    impossible. I couldn't do anything like that. The Star was fairly tight with its
                    money. I knew I wasn't going to get much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was when The Star was beginning to move down, wasn't
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Not yet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did The Post come up and start to be a nationwide
                        newspaper?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: It was coming then. The die was caste in 1954 when The Post bought the
                    Times Herald, but it took quite a while for it to expand. We were still in the
                    catbird seat in terms of advertising, circulation, and everything. I said,
                    “That's quite a job you're offering me. What sort of salary had you in mind?”
                    They said, “I tell you what we're going to do, Smith. We're going to count your
                    time in Africa just as if you had been working here.” I said, “That means
                    instead of making $100/week, I'll be making $115, is that right?”He said, “Yes,
                    that's about right.” I didn't like the sound of that worth a damn. I had been in
                    touch with The Chicago Daily News because Walt Rogers, the guy who headed the
                    Institute, was from Chicago and had worked with The Chicago Daily News as a
                    youngster. They had been receiving my Institute newsletters. So, the foreign
                    editor out there, Baker Marsh, knew all about me. I went out there and said,
                    “Are you interested in hiring me to cover Africa?” They were just the opposite
                    of The Star. They said, “You bet we are!” I said, “What would you have in mind
                    for a salary?” They said, “What do you think you're worth?” I had no idea what I
                    was worth. I had been in Africa for four years. I had no idea what salaries
                    were. I said, “Well, I don't know.” They said, “How about $11,000?” I don't know
                    how they came to that conclusion. I had never heard of so much money in my life.
                    I said, “What about $12,000.” They said, “Well, we'll have to go to Marshall
                    Field about that.” Can you imagine going to Marshall Field? I got my $12,000 and
                    went to work for them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was The Chicago Daily News. Could you describe the
                        paper athat time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: I have a great fondness for The Chicago Daily News. I never had a bad
                    day there. It was moderately conservative, certainly not as conservative as The
                    Tribune. I guess The Daily News was Republican. I'm sure Marshall Field was
                    Republican. But it wasn't wildly conservative. They had had a tradition which
                    began just before World War II of a very fine Foreign Service. All kinds of guys
                    worked there at one time or another: William L. Shirer, Ed Murrow. All the big
                    shots of that time worked there. It was a very proud organization. That aspect
                    of it was beginning to show a little wear. When they hired me, I was by 20 years
                    the youngest correspondent they had, but they still had some good ones: Bill
                    Stoneman in London, George Weller in Rome, Keyes Beech in Tokyo, and so forth. I
                    was very pleased and proud to be hired by them. It was wise to have a sense of
                    humor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were with The Daily News from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: That would have been from 1960-1965.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They didn't have anyone covering Africa at that point, did
                        they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: No. I was the first and I was the last. We had that period where the
                    bloom was on the rose and then went off the rose. When it went off the rose,
                    which I would say was 1964, I went to Harvard on a Nieman fellowship with the
                    object of regearing for Latin America. The Daily News was supportive of this. I
                    spent that year at Harvard studying Latin American affairs and Spanish.</p>
                <p>Q: Let's go back to this 1960-1965 period in Africa. This was a time when some
                    countries became independent. After a while, the intense focus was on the Congo.
                    When you went there, where did you base yourself and how did you cover
                    Africa?</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: I was based in Nairobi, as was almost everybody else, every other
                    American correspondent, not that there were many. There were about six in those
                    days. When the Congo trouble came, I went to Elizabethville, now Lubumbashi, in
                    Katanga, now Shaba. I wrote a book about the Katangese secession.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Moshe Tshombe. You were there when Lumumba was
                        killed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: In 1960/1961.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Lumumba episode in the
                        Congo?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: I did not know Lumumba well. I did not have a good impression of him.
                    It's quite possible that I was a victim of western propaganda in that. I did
                    regard him as a leftist, a pro-communist. He was a hothead also. He didn't seem
                    like the right man. When he was deposed, I was delighted. I wouldn't have wished
                    what happened to him on him.</p>
                <p>Q: Much of the focus on the Congo ended up as an East-West thing between the
                    United States and the Soviet Union. What was your feeling about this?</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: I thought that was it, although I always thought in some way we should
                    not be trying to keep the Russians out of Africa, but to lure them in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You play this game. The way it turned out, it was money
                        down a rathole. They couldn't afford as much.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: To a degree, it was for us, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Proportionally, they probably put more in than we
                        did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: You can't buy those guys. You can only rent them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Congo as being an
                        entity?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: It's too big for one country given its communications problems.
                    Communications were never good there. They were a combination of rail, river,
                    and road. For that to work, things had to go very nicely. You couldn't have
                    disorder here and there and that sort of thing. The Katangese were really quite
                    different in many ways from the people in northern Congo, the Lunda and Baluba.
                    I damn near got killed there by the Baluba.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: There were a number of white mercenaries up in Katanga working for
                    Tshombe, mainly South Africans and Rhodesians, but some British, French, and
                    some Americans. These guys when they'd get drunk, which they did fairly
                    frequently, they considered it amusing to lob mortar shells into the Baluba
                    camps. They had the Baluba concentration camp - not in the sense that they did
                    anything nasty to them there, but they were confined there. The Baluba finally
                    got desperate. They didn't have enough food. They broke out of the camp and came
                    very near to overrunning me.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get to Stanleyville at all during that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: I really was not up there. My friend and Institute colleague, David
                    Reed, was. He wrote a couple of books about that.</p>
                <p>Q: I just interviewed a man yesterday, Dan Phillips, who was in Katanga around
                    1963. He talked about going up to Stanleyville. It was run by mercenaries who
                    were basically wild people. What were your impressions of the governments that
                    were forming in Nigeria, Ghana, etc., and the West African states?</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: I guess I felt that the Anglophone West African states (Nigeria,
                    Ghana, Sierra Leone, Gambia) started pretty well. They were better equipped to
                    go into independence than the East African states. Ghana had a very good civil
                    service, a very good university, a growing middle class, all that good stuff. So
                    did Nigeria. The initial Nigerian governments, when Balewa was the Prime
                    Minister and Azikiwe was the head of what became known as Biafra. I thought
                    rather highly of it. That government was overthrown in the most brutal fashion
                    and everybody was murdered.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your impression of the first wave of what later became known as
                    Africanists in the Foreign Service? They really came in about the time you went
                    out there, too.</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: I would say they were a mix. In the past, many officers who were
                    posted there were not particularly highly thought of by the Department, which is
                    why they were posted there. Then when it became chic and embassies were opening
                    all over the place, it became quite desirable from a sharp young officer's point
                    of view. You can expect to get ahead pretty quickly, more quickly in Africa than
                    in Europe. So, they had some very good ones. Arthur Woodruff, for instance, who
                    was in the same company in the Marine Corps with me in Korea, later became
                    ambassador to Central African Republic. Arthur had served in Katanga. He was a
                    fine officer. I thought very highly of him. Earl Richie, who I met in Eritrea, a
                    career officer who also served in Morocco, was an excellent officer.</p>
                <p>Q: One of the things that I notice in some of my interviews is that they tended
                    to be very eager young officers. I didn't go there, but I applied for Nigeria
                    and ended up in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. But this is a good place to go for
                    somebody who is up for a career and a new thing. At the same time, the first cut
                    as ambassadors were people who had been DCMs [deputy chiefs of mission] in
                    Paris, Bonn, or someplace like that who really were not ready for that type of
                    life at all. So, you had this split in the Service.</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: I think that's so. I think you still get that. There are people going
                    there who have a strong interest in being an ambassador, but a rather weak
                    interest in Africa.</p>

                        Gaulle diit all at once. Wasn't it Senegal where he pulled out
                        everything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Guinea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of those places?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: You just wondered what was going to happen next. I was in Liberia (I
                    was traveling by car) bound for Guinea. That was my next stop, second tour. One
                    had heard a lot about what had happened there. My wife and I took off in our car
                    and headed up to the one road and the one bridge out of the country. There was a
                    big padlock on it. I said, “Where is the officer in charge here?” They said,
                    “He's gone home on leave.” I said, “Did he leave the key with anybody?” They
                    said, “No, he took it with him.” We were stuck for two weeks on the border just
                    waiting for a guy to arrive with a key. We got in then and proceeded to Conakry,
                    which was run in a very haphazard way. I was in the principal administrative
                    building of the government and forget who I was looking for, but I stumbled into
                    the office of Sekou Toure. He was sitting there at his desk. I recognized him. I
                    said, “Mr. President, je suis americain [French: Mr. President, I am an
                    American]” and sat down and had a chat with him. That was the way things worked.
                    They were so disorganized. Bill Atwood was our ambassador there. The Russians
                    were very active, everybody looking out the hotel window.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel very much a part of the international focus
                        on thesplaces, the Cold War, and everything else?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: One did. One thought that perhaps one was important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the Soviets and the Chinese doing in those days?
                        Weryou reporting on what they were up to, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Trying to, but that was the height of the Cold War and they weren't
                    particularly receptive to American journalists. I was turned down for a visa to
                    the Soviet Union when I later went to London. I suspect that is because of my
                    reporting in Katanga. They never told me why. I didn't see a lot of the Chinese
                    or the Soviets personally. I guess they were mainly running in arms.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going back a bit, you were talking about reporting in
                        Katanga.What was the type of reporting that might have riled the
                        Soviets?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: The fact that I will have to admit that my reportage certainly had a
                    pro-Western tinge to it and I was anti-Lumumba. I was pressing for goals that
                    were not their goals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Uganda? How were things working there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Uganda in the days that I was in Kenya as a reporter was very quiet
                    and rather like Ghana in some respects: good public service, good university,
                    quiet little place, doing quite well economically with coffee, cocoa, copper and
                    so forth. I always regard myself as a Kenyan, so I sort of looked down on
                    Uganda. But it was a nice place.</p>
                <p>Q: What about Ghana when you were there? Nkrumah was riding high then and very
                    much an international stage. But from accounts I've heard, he was essentially
                    ruining the country. Did you have that feeling at the time?</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Yes, and it wasn't just Nkrumah. It was people like Krobo Edusei, who
                    was around him, who were thugs. They certainly weren't statesmen and they were
                    barely politicians. They were thieves and thugs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nkrumah had quite a following in the United States for a
                        while.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Those were the people in my mind who did not know what the hell was
                    going on. When I came back at one point, we had a sizable three-man Chicago
                    Daily News bureau at the UN. Those people were rather appalled by me and by my
                    reportage. They thought I was anti-UN, which I may have been.</p>
                <p>Q: What about Tanzania? I think it was Tanganyika and Zanzibar and then it became
                    Tanzania. Julius Nyerere was there. He seems to have sort of captivated
                    everybody who got to talk to him.</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: He was the darling of the liberals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yet he was again destroying his country though
                        socialisexperimentation. Were you getting that at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: I knew Julius before he went into the government, when he was still a
                    labor union organizer. He was a very nice man. One can see why he did change
                    people. But his policies were disastrous for Tanzania.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Q: While you were there reporting, did you find yourself falling under his charm?
                    Was this part of the whole western approach? Was it had to report what in
                    retrospect was not a very auspicious rule?</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Initially, one tended to give Tanzania a break because Julius was
                    transparently a nice man and a well-intentioned man. It took a while before one
                    saw the disastrous effects of his policy. Zanzibar was a little different. There
                    was a lot of leftist activity out there. I knew all those guys quite well. Most
                    of them ended up in jail. Then you had the Africans massacring the Arabs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: No, I was not. I was in Africa, but I wasn't there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've interviewed Frank Carlucci on this. He came a
                        littlafterwards. Were the Soviets messing around there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Yes, and Cubans. I think I thought when we started reporting presumed
                    sightings of Cubans, I think many editors in the United States thought we were
                    embellishing. As we now know, we weren't.</p>
                <p>Q: You left in 1964. You went to Harvard. The Nieman fellowships are renowned in
                    the newspaper world about being a time to decompress and learn something. How
                    did you find you year?</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: It was marvelous. You had Harvard University at your disposal. You can
                    take any course anywhere. You could take a course in the medical, business
                    school, wherever you wish. Your only responsibility is in one course to write
                    all the papers and take all the exams. You're graded in that, but otherwise,
                    you're not graded; in fact, you can't use it to get credit. In some ways, I wish
                    it had not been that way. It was a super experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you do anything particular there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Yes, I had decided at that point (in 1964) that I either had to stay
                    in Africa for life or I had to make a career change. I decided that I would like
                    to go to Latin America. The powers that be on The Daily News were amenable to
                    that. So, I took whatever Harvard had to offer in the way of regional studies,
                    which really was not a great deal. If you want to prep for Latin America, you
                    should go to the University of Texas. But what they did have was excellent. They
                    had some very bright young professors that they turned that over to. I geared up
                    my college Spanish. I took Ted Morrison's writing class, which had always been a
                    favorite with Niemans. I wrote a book in that, a novel. It didn't have anything
                    to do with Africa. It was set in Vietnam. It was a fairly successful year for
                    me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that was 1964-1965. Where did you go then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: What I wanted to do because I believe in it wholeheartedly was to do
                    the same thing in Latin America, to travel by vehicle rather than flying and to
                    do a swing around the continent to the extent that I could and then set up my
                    base someplace. So, we took off driving from Boston and drove down to
                    Washington, home, saw my family, and drove out to Chicago and conferred with my
                    betters out there. Then we drove down to Texas and crossed into Mexico, as I
                    recall, on July 4, 1965. We proceeded south. We traveled the same way we did in
                    Africa, that is, in a leisurely fashion. We were six months in Mexico before we
                    crossed into Guatemala.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Mexico in 1965?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: I suppose the thing that struck one immediately because you
                    encountered it right at the border was the corruption. Of course, the poverty,
                    the unique quality and distribution of income, made for a very small, wealthy
                    upper class, some of whom I had known at Culver. Traditionally, they sent their
                    sons out there because they liked to ride and to improve their English. There
                    was a small middle class and then a huge lower class. At that point, you still
                    had the conflict between church and state in Mexico and the land problem. I
                    haven't been there outside of Mexico City in some years. I suppose they probably
                    all still exist. Then we headed on down to Central America, spending maybe a
                    month or two weeks in a small country. The Panama Canal was as far as you could
                    go. We put the car on a boat to Venezuela. I had to come home for some reason.
                    I've forgotten what it was. I think it was family. We flew back down again,
                    picked up the car, and proceeded south to Venezuela into Colombia. At that time,
                    The Chicago Daily News had a new editor come in. He was less enthusiastic about
                    my continuing in this thing. I had written this novel about Vietnam. I had been
                    in Vietnam on the way home in November of 1963 when Diem was still in power. Of
                    course, it was beginning to heat up by 1965. They wanted me to go out there.
                    That was fine with me, except that they were not going to take Keyes Beach out.
                    Keyes was going to remain in Hong Kong and I would be in Vietnam. I knew what
                    that meant because I knew Keyes. He was a very aggressive newspaper man. He
                    would come in and skim the cream off the thing and I would do the dog work. So,
                    I said, “Look, I'll go if you keep Keyes out of it or, alternately, if you let
                    me finish the Latin American trip.” I still had maybe eight months to go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume you were sending reports.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Oh, yes, I was all the time. Roy Fisher, who was the new editor,
                    thought I was trying to buck him, to question his command or whatever. He said,
                    “I'd like you to go.” I said, “I think we'd better talk about this.” I flew up
                    to Chicago from Cali, Colombia, where we then were, and talked with him. I
                    couldn't convince him that my position had any merit to it really. But I was
                    determined to continue that Latin American trip because I had invested too much
                    time, a whole academic year, in studying up for it and was half way through the
                    trip on the ground. I told him, “I'll reconsider my position, but I'm going to
                    Washington and have a chat with the people at The Star, which I did. Newbold
                    Noyes, who was then the editor of The Star, my second cousin (not that that
                    makes any difference) was delighted to have me back and said, “Sure, you can
                    continue. Finish the trip and then we'll decide.” That was fair enough for me.
                    So, I switched back to The Star while I was in Colombia, and continued on south
                    through Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and so forth, down to Chile. Editors and, I
                    suppose, readers were, if possible, even more disinterested in Latin American
                    news than they were African news. The only time I got on the front page was when
                    I happened to be in Argentina at the time of the Ongania coup, which was just an
                    accident that I was there. The Star was saying to me, “Your writing is fine.”
                    Writing had always been my strongpoint. They said, “But it's a bit too
                    sociological.” I never quite figured out what they meant about that. I guess I
                    was writing about the way people lived rather than political movements. They
                    said, “We'd like you to go to London.” That struck me as a pretty nifty
                    assignment. So, I said, “Okay, when I finish the trip in maybe four months, I'd
                    be delighted to go to London.” So, that was agreed. I finished up in Brazil in
                    December of 1966. Kitty and I flew home and stayed here two days and flew on to
                    London. I took over there as bureau chief. I was the entire bureau. It was a
                    great assignment. I had all of Europe based in London, so when the weather got
                    rotten, I could think of a good story to do in Greece or Portugal and off I'd
                    go. We had no one in Eastern Europe, so I went into Eastern Europe also. I
                    covered the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. That again was a very good three years for
                    me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from 1967-1970.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Yes. My own game plan, my own agenda, was to do another tour in
                    Europe, another three years, and then probably go to Tokyo, spend some time in
                    the Far East. But it didn't work out that way. Newbold said to me, “I want you
                    to come home. I've got a very important job for you, but I'm not going to tell
                    you what it is now.” That didn't please me very much, but he was the boss. So,
                    we went home in 1970. It turned out what he wanted me to do was to be editorial
                    page editor of The Star. That's a pretty good job. It sort of put me in the slot
                    of being Newbold's heir apparent at The Star, which I couldn't complain
                    about.</p>
                <p>So, I did that. I started writing a twice-weekly column, which The Star
                    syndicated for a while. I syndicated it first because they said they weren't
                    interested in syndicating it. Then when I did rather well with it, they talked
                    me into letting them syndicate it for a year. They didn't do as well as I did,
                    so I took it back.</p>

                <p>Q: At this particular time, in the political sector, when you're writing columns,
                    you usually have to fall one place or another. Where were you falling?</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: I was certainly conservative. I was not a conservative in the sense
                    that somebody like George Will might be. I had never been a political activist.
                    Indeed when I became editorial page editor, I dropped my membership in the
                    Republican Party and became an independent because I thought that was more
                    appropriate for the editor. But I was conservative, no question about it. I
                    wasn't as conservative as James (Jack) Kilpatrick or Buckley, but some people
                    seemed to think I was because when Kilpatrick would go on vacation, I would
                    frequently sub for him. His clients never complained.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was The Star the conservative paper and The Washington
                        Post thliberal paper?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: That's right. Of course, there were some internal politickings within
                    the ownership of The Star. Newbie was probably to the left of me, a centrist
                    though. His brother Tommy, who was one of the editorial writers and would dearly
                    have loved to have that job, was considered too left for it by Newbie, his
                    brother, which is why they made me. So, there was a little churning going on
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When were you there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: 1965-1975. I had been there earlier from 1955-1956.</p>
                <p>Q: Could you give me a little feel about, particularly in the foreign affairs
                    field, your impression of Washington in those days? This was Nixon and
                    Kissinger. How was this playing within the conservative circles? Nixon was
                    certainly an internationalist.</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: I guess the primary turning point for everyone was the Vietnam War. I
                    supported Nixon's position. If I had thought about it, I would have supported
                    Kennedy's position to intervene there. I believed in the containment policy,
                    that we would deny to the Soviets any piece of turf we could. There did come a
                    time when, like anyone else who was not a total fool, I did see that we couldn't
                    win that war on the basis that we were allowed to fight it. I don't believe in
                    fighting wars that you aren't allowed to win. So, my view changed there. But I
                    was very much a man of the Cold War. I had a very strong anti-communist tilt to
                    me and I still do.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your impression from the newspaper point of view of the
                    Nixon-Kissinger combination in international affairs, how they used the
                    press?</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Everybody tries to use the press. I don't object to that since you
                    know everybody's going to try to do it. Kissinger wowed the press, including me.
                    Nixon, mainly because of his somewhat unappealing personality, never got the
                    credit for being as astute as he was in foreign policy. I think he was as smart
                    as Kissinger was.</p>
                <p>Q: In my interviews with Foreign Service people, Nixon comes across quite strong
                    on foreign affairs. Even when he was out of office, he went around and talked to
                    people and was considered a first-class mind in really getting in there and
                    finding out things. There is considerable respect for him.</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: At the time, I would have said the combination of Nixon and Kissinger
                    was terrific, but I probably would have given Kissinger more credit for it than
                    Nixon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Watergate play from your perspective? This was a
                        majoevent.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: I viewed Watergate when it happened as the third rate burglary that it
                    was. I didn't think it was particularly important, the usual dirty tricks. That
                    became increasingly difficult for a conservative directing an editorial page of,
                    what's the proper position to take on this? What finally tore it with us at The
                    Star, which caused a 180 degree turn on The Star's part was the-22 minute gap.
                    They just couldn't accept that that was the actual thing that had happened.</p>
                <p>Q: This was his secretary, who had some transcribing tapes and all of a sudden,
                    there is a 22 minute gap and they tried to explain that this was an accidental
                    erasure.</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: It just wasn't plausible, so we ceased to support thPresident
                    anymore.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much debate on the paper on this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Oh, yes. There was a great ferment between the editorial section and
                    the staff. This also extended to the Vietnam War. We had a protest by a bunch of
                    our reporters on the Cambodian incursion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the spring of 1970. I was consul general in

                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Some of these people I had hired personally, like Jimmy Doyle, whom I
                    had gotten from The Boston Globe. I was very bitter about their position. In the
                    first place, demonstrating against their ownership. They insisted in the talks
                    with them and Newbold Noyes that their letter of protest be published in The
                    Star. I thought Newbold was weak as water to allow that. I told him, “If I were
                    you, I'd fire those guys, get them out of here.”</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>Q: Junior Foreign Service officers at the Department of State at the same time
                    were doing the same thing and Nixon said “Fire them.” I think Rodgers sort of
                    sent them off out of sight for a while and it died down.</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: That feeling lasted a long time. We have made it up now, Jimmy Doyle
                    and I, for instance. The only one I haven't made it up with is Mary McCrory.
                    Those were very difficult, tumultuous times for a conservative editor. At the
                    same time, we were starting to lose ground at The Star to The Post. It was
                    money. We were small, family-owned. We didn't have great resources. We couldn't
                    carry losses of about $10 million a year. I had all kinds of worries on my
                    shoulders. I dealt with them as best I could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1975, where did The Star stand vis � vis The Post?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: We were failing. The Post was beating the sand out of us, not in terms
                    of circulation so much as in terms of advertising revenue. It seems to be the
                    practice of merchants (Don't ask me why) that if you have two papers competing
                    and one has 60% of the circulation and the other has 40%, you don't give 60% of
                    your advertising dollar and 40%. You give 100% to the leader. So, although our
                    circulation was holding up alright and The Star was a fine paper in those days
                    still, we were losing ground very rapidly.</p>
                <p>Q: In 1975, whither?</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: In 1975, The Star was sold to Joe Lewis Albritton of Houston, Texas. I
                    was the second person he fired. I had opposed his acquisition. I was a member of
                    the board of the paper, not of the corporation that controlled the whole thing.
                    I resigned from the board when it was clear what they were going to do, that
                    they were going to sell it at a disastrous price. If it had been a publicly held
                    company, they would have had so many stockholder suits it would make their ears
                    burn. I think we got $26 million for the whole thing. That included television
                    stations. A television station is a license to print money. That's what they
                    did, my kinsmen. I got fired, which didn't surprise me. But the column was doing
                    pretty well. In those days, I had maybe 90 subscribers. That saved me from the
                    ignominy of having to go look for a job. Neither my wife nor I are particularly
                    extravagant. Our first and only child was born in 1975. So, that was a change
                    that came on too at that time. I just went on writing the column. That was fine.
                    It gave me more of an opportunity to travel. I had an adventure right at the end
                    of my tenure at The Star and this was something the editorial page editor had no
                    business doing at all. I went out to Iraqi Kurdistan with Barzani and his boys,
                    illegally, of course, and covered the Kurdish rebellion against Saddam Hussein
                    for a while. I was able to go to Angola on my own. When I say “on my own,” I
                    usually had a magazine assignment. In Angola, I had a Readers's Digest
                    assignment. I could use it for the column, covering all the expenses.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>Q: When you were with Barzani in the Kurdish rebellion, this was one that
                    initially the United States was sponsoring and then cut it off at a certain
                    point.</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Yes. There would be some people who might challenge your terminology
                    there, “sponsoring.” Certainly, the Shah of Iran sponsored it and certainly we
                    supported the Shah. That was my position, that we were indirectly responsible
                    for it. Kissinger (and I used to bait him on this all the time because I felt
                    very strongly) always denied that we could have...</p>
                <p>Q: This is something that still hangs around, the culpability of the United
                    States in this support up to a point and then sort of leaving the Kurds hanging
                    out there and then turned on them and suppressed them.</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: I felt very embittered by that. I told the Kurds when I was out there,
                    “You guys mustn't depend on any outside force, including us. If it's not in our
                    national interest anymore, we will stop supporting you. You can only do what you
                    can do with your own people.”</p>
                <p>Q: I think this whole experience with the Kurds is something that has sort of
                    hung over us ever since, as did the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. There was sort of
                    a shyness about getting too involved with local rebellions because we know we
                    probably won't follow through. Many people feel morally responsible if you get
                    too deep into that.</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: I don't know how deep we were into that. Kissinger always denied it.
                    Clearly, if Kissinger had said to the Shah, “You must not do this. You will not
                    do this,” I don't think he would have done it. But it would have taken that.
                    Also, he had the Israelis horsing around in there. What would you say about the
                    Angola thing? There's one that we...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, absolutely. I think the term is a nuanced moral
                        approach tthese things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: I was with Savimbi for a month. I guess I sort of prefer covering from
                    the underdog's point of view, from the guerrilla point of view, rather than from
                    the government, although I did cover the Polisario War in Morocco from the
                    government's side. That's an entirely different situation when you're with the
                    government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were doing this column from about 1975 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: I wrote my last one in 1989. I wrote my first one i1970. So, I was
                    doing it for 19 years.</p>

                        thRepublican Party leadership? Were you mainly with foreign affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Mainly, but I did an analysis of my columns and I think maybe 60% of
                    them were foreign related, maybe 30% domestic, and 10% bits and pieces. Yes, in
                    the sense that I was regarded as a friendly. That's where I got to know a little
                    bit people like George Bush, Barry Goldwater, and people like that. But I think
                    they always regarded me as probably a bit of a maverick. I wasn't dependable on
                    ideological issues. I tended to be more liberal in domestic politics than in
                    foreign affairs, sort of like Senator Dodd used to be in Connecticut.</p>
                <p>Q: You were at least close to the Republican Party, something that's always
                    troubled me about the Republicans is that they seem to have really a carry-over
                    from the 1920s sort of an isolationist hard corps there that really doesn't like
                    foreign affairs. Did you find this at all?</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: I didn't run into that much. I would have thought that since World War
                    II that group had gotten pretty small. Would you include Jesse Helms in
                    that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, in a way. That's not isolationist. But it's a
                        conservativbent that wants to keep relatively uninvolved in foreign
                        affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: I think that was more than counter-balanced by the anti-communism of
                    the Right. Certainly even from a guy like Joe McCarthy on, they were
                    anti-communist.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, and that meant activism. During this time from leaving The Star, was that
                    pretty much what you were doing?</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself back in Africa quite often?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Yes, I did. I was my own boss. I was free to travel where I wanted to
                    travel. I should never reveal this. This is one of the secrets of the trade. You
                    may wonder how I did this when I was off in the boondocks of Angola. I had
                    subbed for Jack Kilpatrick, sometimes under his name, sometimes under my name. I
                    had a guy named Paul Hope who was an editorial writer at The Star and was safely
                    conservative. He wasn't a brilliant writer, but I didn't need to worry that he
                    was going to write something that was going to embarrass me under my name. I
                    could go where I wanted to go and do what I wanted to do. In this period, I took
                    a lot of magazine assignments with Reader's Digest, U.S. News and World Report,
                    and others. I spent a lot of time in what was then Rhodesia covering the
                    guerrilla war there from the government's side.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>Q: This was Ian Smith. This was the Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI).
                    What was your impression of the Smith regime at that point?</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: They certainly weren't monsters. The Rhodesian system, while it was
                    hard on blacks, was not like apartheid. It was not codified in the sense that
                    blacks were excluded from all aspects of life. The universities, for instance,
                    in Rhodesia were more integrated than the universities in the American South. It
                    was totally integrated at the university level. Integration was allowed. So, if
                    some liberal fellow wanted to start an integrated school, he could do so. There
                    was nothing stopping him. These guys tended to be pretty provincial in the sense
                    that any little country like that with a quarter of a million white population
                    to take on Britain and, at least by remote, take on the United States, they
                    should have known that they couldn't win. Constitutionally, since they had had
                    internal autonomy since 1920, they could have carried on just as they were and
                    thumbed their nose at the British. The British had made it clear they were not
                    going to use force against Rhodesia. So, what was an embassy in Lisbon and one
                    in Pretoria worth to them? Was it worth bringing down the wrath of the world on
                    them? It wasn't.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the thrust of your articles during this time as
                        far athe United States' attitude toward the Smith regime?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: I thought we were too hard on him. I had seen the Rhodesian political
                    scene since confederation when Roy Welensky was head of the whole thing,
                    Garfield Todd, who was a liberal, was the Rhodesian Prime Minister. Ever since
                    then, the Rhodesian prime ministers kept getting more and more conservative as
                    more and more pressure was put on them from outside. In other words, it seemed
                    to me like it wasn't working and that maybe we should do as Chet Crocker later
                    did with South Africa, follow a party of engagement, of seeing by supporting
                    these guys to a degree what we could accomplish in liberalizing the regime.
                    Joshua Nkomo or Robert Mugabe in my view could be numbered among the major bad
                    men and there was an awful lot of suffering and killing going on out there that
                    didn't need to happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about South Africa? Were you getting involved with
                        that aall?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: To a degree. I had been banned from South Africa for four years. I
                    finally got them to reverse that when Frick Botha was the ambassador here in
                    Washington. He was a very wise and decent guy. I said to Frick, “Look, if you
                    guys have got problems with me, Smith Hempstone, you really have problems. I am
                    not even Joe Kraft. So, how about it? Let's open up.” They started doing that
                    and started letting me go back in. I don't suppose I had much more luck than any
                    other American reporter in sort of breaking through to the Afrikaner
                    politicians. I was able to deal with them. I had Afrikaner friends in the lower
                    level. Of course, you had this schism within the white community and within
                    Afrikanerdom as to what the proper approach was towards black policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had gone through the Rhodesia-Zimbabwe business. Did
                        you see a parallel in South Africa or was it quite different?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Not so much. South Africa, the white community, was so much stronger,
                    and the economy was so much stronger. I never expected the National Party to
                    come so quickly to the agreement that it did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It surprised everyone. This brings us up to the time when
                        yowere appointed ambassador to Kenya. How did this come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Let me just interject one thing that we haven't talked about. That was
                    my time as executive editor and editor in chief of The Washington Times from
                    1982, The Star having folded in 1981, to 1985. That was a lot of fun. It was
                    very satisfying in some respects because I was able to help a lot of my old Star
                    buddies who were out of jobs, people like photographers. Photographers were a
                    dime a dozen. I hired a whole photographic section in one day at The Times. I
                    was executive editor when we started. There were just two of us, myself and Jim
                    Whelan, who was the first editor in chief. I was always glad to have a go at The
                    Post.</p>
                <p>Q: The paper was supported by the Unification Church of the Reverend Moon. This
                    left a real taint on the process. You were there in the place.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: In the first place, I very much resented that because I said, “Look,
                    if you've got a quarter, you can buy this newspaper every day and you show me
                    the effects of the Reverend Moon on it.” He owned it. I said, “I'm running a
                    newspaper, not a seminary.” It was very difficult to get people to accept that.
                    The Moonies generally speaking treated me quite properly. Did they try to
                    influence policy? Sure, they nibbled around the edges the way any publisher
                    does. Sam Kauffman, who was publisher of The Star used to get on my case from
                    time to time on editorial policy. I did the same thing at The Times that I did
                    at The Star: I listed politely and said, “Thank you very much for giving me your
                    views on the subject” and went on and did what I thought was the proper thing to
                    do. The proper thing to do in my view was to cover the Reverend Moon and the
                    Unification Church with unedited AP copy, which is what we did, including his
                    sentencing to jail for income tax evasion, the Moonie wedding at the stadium.
                    You see the paper today, 15 years later, and you won't find the fingerprints of
                    the Unification Church on it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It must have been a topic of conversation amongst
                        thprofessional newspaper people. What was in it for the Reverend Moon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: I never had an official answer to that, but my own view is that he
                    hoped through The Washington Times to shorten the period in the wilderness of
                    the Unification Church where they would become more acceptable, which I think
                    they have. Of course, they stopped doing some things that were making them
                    unacceptable, although it was always exaggerated, this forcible recruiting of
                    people and holding them. That happened on the West Coast. There were very few
                    cases of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's very Korean. I served in Korea from 1976-1979. We
                        wervery suspicious of the Unification Church and its influence.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Korea is full of churches like that. I don't know that I ever told
                    Moon this. In the first place, I only saw him about three times. His English was
                    not too good. But Colonel Pak, who was his honcho on the paper, and he didn't
                    like this, which I understand, and I think it had a lot to do with my eventual
                    departure from the paper, I told Colonel Pak, “The success or failure of The
                    Washington Times will depend directly on the distance that we can lay between
                    ourselves and the Unification Church. We've got to shake this image to the
                    extent that we can.” That hurts your feelings. It would have hurt my feelings. I
                    refused, as Whelan had done, to go to any of their big seminars of writers,
                    scientists, and lawyers, very first class. They flew everybody to Moscow first
                    class. That hurt their feelings that I wouldn't go to those. I just said, “I
                    simply can't do it. I have to stay here and run this newspaper.” The time came
                    when Arnaud de Borgrave, who had been scheming against me, replaced me in
                    1985.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>So then I'm back to doing the column again for another three years. I had gotten
                    bored with the newspaper business. I had done everything that I wanted to do. I
                    had been an editor-in-chief of a Washington newspaper. I got to start a
                    Washington newspaper, which nobody else this century has done. I had been an
                    editorial page editor at The Star. I had been a columnist. I had been a foreign
                    correspondent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Been there, done that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Yes. The only thing I could have said is like Hagar the Horrible:
                    “Seconds.” In 1987, I was up in Maine thinking about it, and as I always say, a
                    lightbulb exploded inside my head and I recall there was to be a presidential
                    election the next year in 1988. It seemed to me (You didn't have to be a genius
                    to figure this out) that the Republican was probably going to win that election.
                    It seemed to me that, in all probability, though he had not yet declared, George
                    Bush was going to be the candidate. Then it occurred to me that he would need an
                    ambassador to Kenya. Why not me? I could think of about 14 reasons. I really
                    didn't know Bush that well. I had never been a Republican activist. I had given
                    Bush $100. That was my extent of being a big donor. But I was regarded as a
                    friendly and so forth. I hadn't gone to Yale, to Andover, wherever it is he
                    went, hadn't been in the Navy, hadn't belonged to Skull and Bones, hadn't been
                    in the oil business in Texas. There were any number of people that would have
                    had a closer association than I. On the other hand, I did know something about
                    Africa. I did want to be ambassador to Kenya. So that eliminated an awful lot of
                    people who were not qualified, I presume, or who didn't want it. I kind of
                    forgot about that by the summer, but October 1987 came along. Nobody had
                    declared yet. Bush had not declared his candidacy. I closed down the cottage and
                    came back down here. As it happened, I was invited to a White House reception -
                    I think it was for the press. While I was wandering around there with a weak
                    drink in one hand and a soggy canape in the other, I saw Bush standing in the
                    corner all by himself, as American Vice Presidents tended to have to do since
                    nobody wants to talk to them. I went up to him and reintroduced myself. He
                    claimed he knew very well who I was. I said, “Mr. Bush, when you are President,
                    I would like to be your ambassador to Kenya.” He drew back a little bit because
                    that's not the way you do it, but he recovered himself quickly and said, “Well,
                    Smith, that's a very interesting notion.” So, it was left at that. There was
                    certainly no commitment on anybody's side. But in due course, he did declare, he
                    did get the nomination, he was elected. At that point, I wrote him a note. I
                    said, “Mr. President Elect, I just want to remind you of our conversation in the
                    White House and my statement that I'd like to be your ambassador to Kenya. I
                    just want you to know I was dead serious about that.” I received a note back
                    from him. He was, as you know, a prolific writer. He said something
                    non-committal such as “Well, Smith, that's very interesting and we'll certainly
                    keep you in mind.” Then I started doing a little maneuvering on my own. In the
                    first place, I couldn't expect to get the nomination through the usual channels.
                    Maryland in those days (1987/1988) had a democratic governor and two democratic
                    senators and six out of eight democratic congressmen. So, I decided “I'm going
                    to have to get this in an unusual way. I am going to have to get it on the basis
                    of merit, on a national basis.” So, in 35 years in the newspaper business, I had
                    earned a few chips here and there with some people whose names would be
                    well-known to you and to others: Henry Kissinger, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Dick Helms;
                    and then some people whose names would not be familiar probably even to you, who
                    is much more knowledgeable than most people, but are well-known within the
                    foreign affairs circle. These included academics like Ned Munger from Cal
                    [California] Tech and Carl Brown from Princeton. They included politicians such
                    as Dick Lugar from Indiana and Jesse Helms from North Carolina. They included
                    people in the intelligence community such as Dick Helms and Howard Imerey. Did
                    you ever know Howard?</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I don't.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: It's alright to mention his name now because he's retired. I still see
                    a whole bunch of these guys: John Waller. A bunch of career Foreign Service
                    people such as Arthur Woodruff and Earl Ritchie. A bunch of businessmen. What I
                    tried to do was get people right across the stratum of society but with a
                    concentration in foreign affairs. To my absolute astonishment, 44 of the 45
                    agreed to do so, to either write or speak to either Bush or Baker, and probably
                    some of them even did so. I think most of them probably did; some didn't. The
                    one who turned me down was Bob McCloskey, who had been ambassador to Cyprus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And spokesman.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Yes, spokesman for Kissinger. Then he went on to be head of Catholic
                    Relief. I knew Bob very well. He was a friend of mine. He said, “I just can't do
                    it because all my career, I've inveighed against political appointees and it
                    would be incongruous for me to support your candidacy.” I didn't say to him,
                    “Bob, I'm a different kettle of fish and you can take your incongruity and stick
                    it up your...” I said, “Okay, I understand perfectly.” Also, I have a nephew who
                    worked in the White House at a low level. As it happened, I was over there
                    chatting him up one time in the old State War Navy Building, the Executive
                    Building. We ran into in the hallway Chase Untermeyer. He was the head of White
                    House Personnel under Bush. My nephew introduced me to him. He knew that I was
                    interested in the Kenya appointment. The time came when he arranged for me to go
                    with General Vernon (Dick) Walters on a small group to represent the United
                    States on the anniversary of the accession to the throne of King Hassan of
                    Morocco. There was no substance at all of the trip. It was just protocol. But it
                    gave somebody (I don't know whether it was Dick Walters or Mrs. Potter Stewart,
                    who was a big pal of Mrs. Bush) a chance to see me over a period of time and see
                    how I behaved myself and that sort of thing. So, I guess I passed that test
                    because the time came in the spring of 1989 when Jim Baker called me. He said,
                    “Well, Smith, how are you doing?” It was a very friendly conversation. I was on
                    vacation down in South Carolina. I said, “I'm doing fine, Mr. Secretary.” He
                    said, “I understand that you're a candidate for the ambassadorship to Kenya.” I
                    said, “You bet I am.” He said, “I think that's grand. I can't promise you
                    anything, but I can tell you you're on the short list. My advice to you would be
                    to get a little more support in the Senate. What you've been doing is fine, but
                    you need some more in the Senate.” So, I said, “Okay.” I went about doing that.
                    It was a simple enough thing. I simply called up the senators or their
                    administrative assistants or their press assistants and got an appointment with
                    them and went up and said, “Mr. Senator, I am hopeful of being appointment
                    ambassador to Kenya. I think you know my background. I just want to present
                    myself to you so that if you have any concerns about me or about policy towards
                    Kenya, you can ask me and I'll do my best to answer.” I worked both sides of the
                    aisle on that, Democrats and Republicans, although naturally I tended to go to
                    more conservative Democrats (Sam Nunn, Chuck Robb, and so forth). So, when the
                    time came in the spring of 1989, it was a Sunday and my wife was out on a walk
                    across the Bay Bridge, when the phone rang and it was a Camp David operator and
                    he put Mr. Bush on. Mr. Bush said, “Smith, I wonder if you would be prepared to
                    temporarily give up your very interesting newspaper work to serve as my
                    ambassador to Kenya.” I practically jumped through the ceiling. I said, “Well,
                    Mr. President, I would be pleased and honored to do that.” He said, “Fine,
                    that's done then. I want to get you and Kitty over here to the White House a
                    couple of times and then you're on your way.” I said, “Thank you very much.” So,
                    I was named and then I sat around cooling my heels for four or five months.
                    There were people I needed to see here in the Department and outside of the
                    Department. I spent some time over at the Foreign Service Institute brushing up
                    on my Swahili. In due course, I went before the Committee for Foreign Affairs.
                    It was a big disappointment for me because I was loaded for bear. I had reviewed
                    all my files. I knew everything you could possible ask me about Kenya. I think I
                    was asked two questions. Paul Simon asked me how my Swahili was and I told him
                    it was rusty but redeemable and that I was doing my best to redeem it at FSI and
                    that pleased him. He said, “Will you continue doing that if you are appointed”
                    and I said, “Yes, I will, Sir.” He said, “How do I know that we can count upon
                    you to defend human rights in Kenya?” I said, “You can count upon me because I
                    am an American, Senator.” He didn't seem quite satisfied, but he accepted it.
                    That was all. It took about three minutes. Then we were off shortly
                    thereafter.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: I arrived there on December 1, 1989.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you left when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: February 26, 1993.</p>
                <p>Q: Before you went out, you had been reading up about the country at the State
                    Department, talking to other people. What were you carrying with you as your
                    mental portfolio of things that you felt needed to be done? How did you see
                    American interests in Kenya?</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Not at all the way it worked out. In the first place, that was a
                    rather benign period in Kenya's history. There were no political detainees.
                    Daniel arap (son of) Moi's grasp on the country as far as I could see from there
                    was fairly easy. There were probably worse tyrants than he around. I thought I
                    was going to spend my time getting the security treaty with Kenya, which had
                    expired in June, reupped and helping Richard Leaky preserve the elephant (He is
                    a paleontologist) and do whatever I could do in terms of AIDS. I assumed that we
                    had some programs out there- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>Q: You had obviously traveled extensively in Europe, Africa, and Latin America.
                    What was your impression at the time you arrived of the American Foreign Service
                    and how it operated?</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Of course, on my arrival, any pro or con bias really was not very
                    strong. I hadn't really worked with them on a day in, day out basis. As far as
                    the time in the Department was concerned, I had a very good desk officer, Jim
                    Entwhistle. So, I had a good impression from him of that end of things. I
                    suppose my initial impression was positive enough. I had no reason to think
                    otherwise, though that did change a bit for the worse. I had some very good
                    officers in Kenya. I mention most of them by name in the book, Rogue Ambassador.
                    I knew my political officer, Al Eastham, was first-rate. Both my station chiefs
                    were okay. I had a good economic officer, good consular officers. I had no
                    complaints. But I did find as I got to know more of them better that there were
                    amongst them many to whom the assignment to Kenya was just another job. They
                    were what we would call in the private sector “Clock-watchers,” many careerists
                    amongst them who seemed to spend more time on the telephone to Washington trying
                    to line up their next job. Many of them never left Nairobi, never had any
                    interest in the country. There certainly wasn't any such thing as a cultural
                    bath going on. I was disappointed in that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who had been the ambassador before you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Elinor Constable.</p>
                <p>Q: I've interviewed her. How did you find at the time the connections with the
                    embassy with the Kenyan government and the various organs, newspapers, T.V., and
                    all that?</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: I want to be fair to Mrs. Constable, but I don't think she had
                    particularly cordial relations with any of the power areas. I think that was
                    probably largely because of her physical condition. Her eyesight was so bad that
                    she had to have an aide stand next to her to tell her who somebody was. Her
                    hearing was also bad. Her husband was not with her. He was then in Rome on
                    another assignment. So, she was by herself, in poor health. She became sort of a
                    semi-recluse. The only one whom I'm told ever saw much of her was George
                    Griffin, her DCM. She didn't tend to open up the residence to members of the
                    staff and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now that you were on the ground, what did you feel that
                        you'better start doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Being the new boy on the block, there were a number of things I had to
                    do. First I had to deliver my letters to Moi, which was accomplished rather
                    quickly, within a week. Then I had to call on the ministers and I had to call on
                    the other ambassadors, just protocol things really to open up lines of
                    communication. While I was doing that, I had to make some connections in the
                    private sector, white and black, American, British, and Kenyan, and other
                    denominations. I should say that the first four months almost was a honeymoon
                    period. The Kenyans, the government, had been delighted with my appointment.
                    Mrs. Constable they did not feel was the greatest thing since sliced bread,
                    maybe because she was beginning to articulate some of the concerns that I later
                    did. They knew who I was. They knew I was conservative. They knew I was a
                    political appointee and had George Bush's ear every day. I never saw George Bush
                    again. I knew Moi slightly. I knew lots of the old timers around there from the
                    days right after independence. So, they thought they had gotten a patsy. I
                    followed around dutifully on Moi's heels and went to things other ambassadors
                    wouldn't dream of doing like agricultural shows and college graduations. At all
                    of these places, I saw Moi and the members of the Cabinet, even those I hadn't
                    formally called on. So, that's what I was doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Moi?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: At first, he seemed like a rather genial, avuncular type. He wasn't
                    any nuclear scientist in terms of intelligence I did not think and do not think
                    now. He was a little uneasy. He didn't accept any sort of criticism at all well.
                    You could say he was paranoid. I would say now he was paranoid, but I didn't
                    know that then. He was very nice to me in those initial months. I guess I knew
                    him for what he was, a pastoralist, a member of the pastoral tribe, a tribe that
                    was economically disadvantaged, and he from one of the poorer families of the
                    tribe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What tribe was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: This was the Tugen of the Kalenjin language group. It's 14 small
                    tribes, one big tribe, the Nandi. They're sort of decent, stalwart guys who
                    serve in the police and the army. All Moi had was a high school education and
                    not a particularly good high school. He never traveled until he got into
                    politics and that sort of travel was worthless in some ways. He was not a
                    sophisticated man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the people surrounding him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: As things began to go bad, let me just mention that. Things started to
                    go bad, at least in my view, when Robert Ouko, the Foreign Minister of Kenya,
                    was murdered in Kenya after a visit to Washington. The head of the police
                    initially put out the story that he might have committed suicide. He died of a
                    broken leg with his hands crushed and most of his body burned and a couple of
                    bullet holes in the back of his head. So, that first awakened my eyes to the
                    fact that maybe we were dealing with some guys who weren't nature's noblemen. I
                    initially subscribed to the view which a number of people held that Moi was a
                    pretty decent individual, but he was surrounded my some evil advisors. He
                    certainly was surrounded by some evil advisors like Nicholas Biwott, the
                    Minister of Energy; and Willie Entimama, the Minister of Local Government;
                    Wangale; and some others whose names I've forgotten. I used to call them the
                    thug wing of the party and they were thugs. I thought, “He's a captive of the
                    thug wing. The thing to do is try to separate him from that group and get him to
                    move against them, replace them with decent people, of which there are plenty
                    around.” But it soon proved, as things deteriorated after the Saba-Saba riots in
                    which at least 20 people were killed (The opposition says it was more like 200),
                    that was not the case. Moi was at the center of the policy of that group. He
                    probably couldn't even if he wanted to separate himself from someone like
                    Biwott, who had been with him personally (He was also a Kalenjin), who had so
                    much on him and probably had it stashed away in a safety deposit box to be
                    opened on the occasion of his death, that Moi wouldn't dare move against
                    him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why had the Foreign Minister been killed?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: We don't know. That is a very interesting story. I tried to find out.
                    I was constantly being asked this by the Kenyans and by other people. The
                    Russian ambassador pointed out that he had just come from Washington, obviously
                    something had happened with us that caused his death. The rumors were, and it
                    was probably somewhere close to that, that someone had made the mistake of
                    mentioning that he might make a good president of Kenya, which is enough to get
                    you killed. Also, there was a report that he had seen Bush, whereas Moi had not.
                    When I say “seen him,” they both saw Bush at a prayer breakfast and had maybe
                    shaken hands and said a few words. But certainly Moi had not been to the White
                    House. As it happened, a few months later, I received from Joseph Verner Reed,
                    former ambassador to Morocco and Chief of Protocol, (I always got along well
                    with Mr. Reed. He was always kind to me. A lot of people don't like him in the
                    Department, but that didn't make any difference to me. I did like him. [He sent
                    me]) a photograph and asked me to deliver it. It was a photograph of Ouko
                    shaking hands with Bush on the steps of the White House. There was no date on
                    it. There was no explanation of it. I wrote back to Ambassador Reed and said, “I
                    can't deliver this, Joe, because, as you will recall, the Foreign Minister
                    departed this veil of tears some six months ago. I will send it to Mrs. Ouko,”
                    which I did. I never pressed him for an explanation. I should have. I have been
                    in contact with him a couple of times. He has read my book.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is he here in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: No. He lives up in Connecticut. He works at the UN now. He has read
                    the book, so he knows the story, which I repeated in the book. He hasn't
                    challenged me on that, nor made any explanation. So, I don't know. Of course,
                    there are other reasons, too. There is allegedly a molasses factory up in Ouko's
                    area which was deeply enmeshed in corruption - and he was including some other
                    ministers in the government that he was trying to blow the whistle on. That may
                    have had something to do with it. It could have had something to do with a
                    woman, “cherchez la femme” [French: search for the woman]</p>

                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Yes, it did, but prior to that, back at Christmastime there had been
                    what they would call in the Department, the Peterson cable, from Ambassador
                    Donald Peterson, who was then in Tanzania. He served all around. He's an old
                    hand.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: He made, as far as I know, the original suggestion that the United
                    States now that the Cold War was over, which it was, should change its policy to
                    support most vigorously those nations which shared our ideas and ideals for
                    human rights, expansion of democracy, and the rule of law. Herman Cohen, the
                    Assistant Secretary for Africa, had had the cable copied and sent to all of us
                    with his imprimatur. Then he had called a meeting of all the ambassadors. I
                    think as frequently, I gather, as is the case at the State Department, there was
                    no need to call the meetings and the conference because it had already been
                    decided that that would be U.S. policy. In fact, I believe, both Baker and Bush
                    had articulated it even before that. I was prepared to get on that human rights
                    horse extraneous from what happened to Robert Ouko. But it helped contribute to
                    it, as did the government's reaction to the formation in June of 1990 of the
                    Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (FORD). This involved dissenters from the
                    Moi line, some of them former Cabinet ministers like Ken Matiba, some of them
                    youngsters like Paul Muite, who had been involved at a very high level. Since
                    Kenya was still a single party state, they couldn't call FORD a political party.
                    They called it a movement to discuss the future of Kenya. I had put out my lines
                    already to the opposition. It was clear that Moi didn't like my doing that. But
                    I told him, “It is my duty to know and to report what is going on in this
                    country to the Department.” I pointed out to him what had happened in Iran,
                    where we had had no contact with the opposition because the Shah didn't want us
                    to and we ended up with egg on our face. So, I said, “I'm sorry, but I feel I
                    must do this.” So, I did. At the Fourth of July party, I had many opposition
                    leaders. I also had government servants. That again was part of my idea to make
                    the embassy and the residence a place where men of good will could gather and
                    discuss things in a rational fashion, as indeed they did. Everybody had a good
                    time. You could see the judges who sent them to jail talking to guys and
                    laughing like rails. But right after the Fourth of July party, there had been a
                    FORD rally scheduled for July 7th, but the government had denied them a permit.
                    So, the leaders of FORD (Matiba, etc.) said, “Okay, we won't hold the meeting,
                    but we will continue to press for such a meeting.” As it happened, the
                    government moved against the leaders anyway on the 4th, 5th, and 6th, arresting
                    the eight most prominent of them and many small fish also. They were detained
                    and then rioting broke out on the 7th. Those were the so-called Saba-Saba riots.
                    It was the 7th day of the 7th month. A number of people were killed, somewhere
                    between 20 and 200. I protested openly both the opposition's brutality and the
                    security force's brutality in putting it down. The General Services Unit (GSU)
                    was out there with ax handles beating up grandmothers and all that sort of
                    thing. I also said I didn't think much of the arson and looting that the
                    democrats on the left engaged in. A human rights lawyer, Gibson Kamau Kuria, had
                    taken refuge in the embassy and asked for asylum, which I granted him. I wasn't
                    the one who talked to him. I had my political officer, my station chief, and my
                    consular officer talk to him and they all agreed that his concern was genuine,
                    that if he were put out on the street he would be arrested. He had been arrested
                    before and tortured. So, I said, “Okay, Gibson, you can stay for the time being
                    and we'll see what we can work out.” Then I informed Cohen. I didn't ask Cohen's
                    permission. I told him. I don't think he was pleased as punch. I don't suppose
                    he should have been. He said, “You know you're going to have a hard time ahead
                    of you there.” I said, “I guess I do know that, but I didn't see that I had any
                    choice.” We worked out between us (and I will give the Department the lion's
                    share of the credit for this) getting Kuria out of Kenya, working it out with
                    the Kenyan government that he could leave and I escorted him to the airport and
                    saw him on the plane. He came to America, got a job at Harvard and Yale.
                    Relations were very cool between me and the Kenyans.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: I knew him. I had met him. He was one of the young lawyers who had
                    been around to my house. But he was by no means the one I knew best. He was one
                    that I knew really least.</p>
                <p>Q: Around the Fourth of July, what about what our concerns were on human rights?
                    How did we talk to a government when they're supposedly putting down unrest?</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: I know what I did. My immediate concern was to get the conditions of
                    detention improved. They were held under rather draconian conditions. They were
                    treated like criminals and criminals aren't treated very sweetly in Kenya.
                    Matiba was denied adequate medical assistance and suffered a couple of strokes
                    while in prison, which permanently impaired him. He still can't read, can't use
                    his right hand or right arm. I wanted to see that they received visits from
                    family and clergymen. Oddly enough, when I went to the Attorney General, who was
                    then Muli, he was not well thought off. The guy had spent a little too much time
                    drinking. He gave me the list of visits to each of these guys. It was damning.
                    He was fired two days later for having given it to me.</p>

                <p>HEMPSTONE: Except I would say it is our business. We don't just export Coca-Cola
                    and blue jeans. We export democracy. Thomas Jefferson didn't say that all
                    Americans have these rights. He said, “All men have these rights.” I thought,
                    “If you want to have warm relations with us, you will give them these rights. If
                    you don't give a damn about your relations with us, you treat them any way you
                    want to.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: We started cutting aid, which was at that point about $80 million a
                    year after Saba-Saba, the riots. We froze all military aid. We started cutting
                    and now it's $27 million or something like that. It cost them millions of
                    dollars.</p>

                        iprocess. What was that about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: That was kind of a strange treaty in that it is well-known in this
                    country, at least in circles that interest themselves in such things, but it's
                    top secret in Kenya. You can't even mention it. What that allegedly did was give
                    us these three airports (Mombasa, Nairobi, and Nanyuki) and also the Port of
                    Mombasa when we had need of them. I say “allegedly” because it wasn't automatic.
                    Any time you had an airplane coming in, you had to go with all the numbers and
                    so forth. You had to get permission for it. We didn't pay very much for that
                    treaty. I think we gave them something like $270,000 a year. Before I went out,
                    one of the people I talked to was Mike Armacost, who was then doing the security
                    portfolio. I said, “I know these people are going to ask for more money and we
                    don't pay them very much. How much have I got to play with?” He said, “Not a
                    dime.” So, it became clear in that instance that we didn't put that much
                    importance on the Kenyan bases because we had the Indian Ocean. We had good
                    relations with Oman and could use [the island of Diego] Garcia.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was July 1990. How were things going in the Persian
                        Gulf athis point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: It was on. I've forgotten the dates. We, like everybody else in the
                    region, were sort of geared up to support to the extent that our support was
                    necessary or desirable. In our case, it wasn't much. I don't think we had a
                    single ship visit during that time. The Department was concerned about the
                    activities of Iraqi terrorists. They put out a lot of security stuff which I
                    tended to ignore. The Department during Desert Storm told us to take all kinds
                    of security precautions which seemed to me unnecessary and indeed deleterious in
                    the sense that I didn't want the Kenyans or the other ambassadors to think that
                    we had the wind up so much about this bunch of ragheads and go running for
                    cover. We were supposed to use different routes coming to work and come in at
                    different hours. I did carry a pistol during that time, the only time I did out
                    there. Otherwise, I flew the flag from the car just to show them where we
                    were.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Actually, Kenya didn't play much of a role in Desert

                <p>HEMPSTONE: No. Guys came there for liberty.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened with our treaty? Did they ask for more money
                        anyou said “No?”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: As I recall, it was mutually determined given the atmosphere which
                    existed between their government and our government (or at least between their
                    government and my embassy) that this would not be a propitious time to
                    renegotiate. I don't remember whether we set up a committee on the military side
                    just to talk about things so we knew more or less where we stood. Anyway, the
                    impression was, “Okay, not too much of a hurry. You can probably use it.” We did
                    use it in providing relief food for Somalia. We used the airports and the port.
                    That was an interesting thing, too, in that I was out of Nairobi down on the
                    Tanzania frontier when my radio in the jeep came on saying to get back to
                    Nairobi right away. They didn't want to talk about what it was, but said I might
                    be able to guess. Somalia was certainly a strong header for what it might be and
                    it was. The word I had was that we were going to launch a food relief program
                    from Kenya. I said, “When?” They said, “They're on their way.” I said to Michael
                    Southwick, then the DCM, “Have you informed the Kenyans?” He said, “I tried, but
                    it was a weekend and there was nobody at the Foreign Ministry.” I said, “Go and
                    park at Sally Koskie's house (She was the Permanent Secretary for the Ministry
                    of Foreign Affairs) and let her know that this is happening. Meanwhile, I'm
                    going to get down to Mombasa to meet the planes when they come in.” At that
                    point, I think there were maybe two or three C-130s. I went down there and they
                    arrived on schedule. There was Brigadier General Frank Lebutti, now Lieutenant
                    General Frank Lebutti. He was then a brand new brigadier. He had just gotten his
                    star about two weeks before. He seemed a little bemused about where he might be.
                    He was an American Marine. He was the head of the operation. He said, “Are we
                    going to have a security problem here?” I said, “No, Sir. You may be overrun by
                    souvenir hawkers and prostitutes and that sort of thing, but your greatest pain
                    is going to be sunburn. These are friendlies really.” He was glad to hear that.
                    We got the headquarters set up. It had been well set up by my people. I had a
                    very good consul in Mombasa named Don Stader. We had a shed out there, a hangar
                    that we maintained and he had gotten that all fixed up for headquarters for
                    Lebutti and gotten them all hotel rooms. Then he said, “There is a message for
                    you at the consulate to call Southwick in Nairobi,” which I did. He said, “Moi
                    has called it all off.” I said, “What are you talking about?” He said, “He's
                    called off Operation Provide Relief.” I said, “Well, get word to him. Go see him
                    or at least talk to him on the telephone and see to it that he doesn't say
                    anything more in public until I get there, which would make it more difficult
                    for him to climb down.” In point of fact, the statement didn't have Moi's name
                    attached to it, which made it easier for him to climb down. I said, “I'm on my
                    way up there.” I got up there and called Moi. I said, “Mr. President, I feel I
                    must be misinformed because I am told that you have canceled Operation Provide
                    Relief.” He said, “No, you're not misinformed. I have canceled it.” I said,
                    “Sir, if I may point out, this is entirely a food operation. A lot of the food
                    is going to go to your people when you've got an election coming up. I just
                    wonder if you might want to reconsider. The foreign press is pouring in here
                    (which it was) and if we have to tell them, and I've got a press conference set
                    up for tomorrow, that this thing has been canceled, the effect is going to be
                    very bad for Kenya, bad for you.” He said, “Well, I think you'd better get over
                    here and bring your top people and I'll get my top people.” So, we gave him the
                    full court press. By then, Lebutti and his assistant were out there. I took them
                    along and took along our military in their war suits and medals and all, and our
                    political people, and the Agency people. He had a flock of Cabinet ministers
                    there, including the Foreign Minister and the Defense Minister. So, it was a
                    pretty heavy crowd on both sides. Moi started out the discussion. The thrust of
                    it was how, yes, he had canceled it because we hadn't gone about it properly; we
                    hadn't asked permission; and we didn't do that because we took them for granted
                    now that the Cold War was over; we had forgotten that he was the first person
                    who opposed communism. Before he got too carried away, I interjected and said,
                    “Mr. President, we have not forgotten that you're the first person to oppose
                    communism. Of course, we honor you for that. This is just what it appears to be.
                    It's a food operation for your people and for the Somalis.”</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say “your people,” what was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: A quarter of the stuff was going to northeastern Kenya.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about an extreme drought.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: And disorder. Many Somalis had fled into Kenya, most of them armed. I
                    said, “One out of every four tons is going to go to Kenyans. It will be based
                    out of Mombasa so that we will not be too conspicuous, we Americans. I can't see
                    why you would want to cancel such an operation. If I may make a suggestion, why
                    don't we change my press conference into a Kenyan press conference, let the
                    Foreign Minister handle it. He can put whatever spin he wishes on this. Our only
                    interest is in getting the food through to people who are hungry.” Michael
                    Southwick suggested, knowing how all bureaucrats love a committee, “Why don't we
                    set up a committee, half Kenyan, half American, to monitor the operation on a
                    day to day basis.” Lebutti chimed in, saying, “I think that's an excellent idea
                    and I'll send an officer here who will sit with you people (meaning General
                    Mohammad) and you send one of equal rank down to me and he'll know everything
                    that we're doing.” So, Moi sort of hesitated then. It was clear that he had been
                    somewhat mollified by this. He said, “I'll think about it.” I said, “Mr.
                    President, we haven't got time to think about it. The press is coming in here.
                    Lebutti is here with his planes. Even now, he needs to be flying reconnaissance
                    missions into Somalia. We want to start the food going by early next week.” He
                    finally said, “Well, alright, you can start it on a day to day basis. But if I
                    don't like it, you'll cancel it.” So, that's what we did. We got the thing off
                    the ground, but just barely.</p>
                <p>Q: Obviously, a drought doesn't just happen overnight. Had this been something
                    that we were monitoring? Strictly from your embassy point of view, were you
                    looking at and realized we had a situation developing?</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: To give myself credit, I had spent some time recently up in the
                    northeast. I had written a couple of cables which were sufficiently moving that
                    they were brought to George Bush's attention. That apparently is what got it off
                    the ground as far as Kenya was concerned. Of course, we had an idea of what was
                    going on in Somalia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was our ambassador in Mogadiscio at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: We did not have one. We had evacuated the embassearlier when it was

                <p>HEMPSTONE: It was quite an operation. The Marines never got credit for it because
                    so much else was going on. Not only did they snatch all our people, but they
                    snatched most of the diplomatic corps.</p>

                    sanitary conditions. Clearly, they were hungry already and they were going to
                    have cholera and stuff like that. So, yes, we were sending out stuff all the

                    this is that our response was very much driven by the pictures from Somalia on
                    the nightly news. Were you getting reverberations from this?</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: I can't say that I was getting reverberations. I had taken the
                    precaution of assuming that we might very well have to evacuate our people from
                    Addis Ababa overland. I had sent people up to the border to make arrangements up
                    there. [The entire embassy], Ambassador Cheek and his people, [were evacuated]
                    out of Sudan [to Nairobi hours before the air war started]. I had sent Michael
                    Southwick into southern Sudan. I had been up there myself on the border. We were
                    looking at any number of ways.</p>

                <p>HEMPSTONE: I suppose they were. We managed in most instances to have a fairly
                    decent supply of food, blankets, medicine, and so forth on hand when people
                    started pouring in from wherever they started pouring in. It was never enough. I
                    really didn't see as much of the AID people as I probably should have and they
                    should have seen me. I don't think that was too well coordinated in that I don't

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the government of Kenya responding to this, prior
                        to tharrival of food aid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: In a rather ambiguous fashion. In the first place, General Mohammad,
                    the Chief of Staff of the Kenyan army, is an ethnic Somali. He is now retired.
                    He was up to his armpits in Somali politics, including gun running and
                    everything else. So, he was very much an interested party. The Kenyans
                    themselves don't like Somalis, don't trust them, didn't want Somali refugees in
                    their country. So, it was difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The original intervention there was staged through
                        Mombasa. How did that work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: That worked very well. It was limited in its scope. All we were doing
                    was delivering food to a number of airfields in Somalia where the Red Cross was
                    taking it over as our agent to distribute it. If there was trouble around an
                    airfield, we didn't go in there that day. We went someplace else. When we did go
                    in, they kept the engine running. They could unload one of those big planes in
                    20 minutes and get out of there. So, we never lost a life. Material damage was
                    insignificant, a couple holes in airplanes, that's about all. Then there
                    followed, and that's when I got really deeply involved, the second phase, which
                    was unilateral American armed intervention in Somalia - 20,000 [troops].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you envisaged before that we might get into this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: I had envisaged it in the sense that it almost always happens that way
                    when you start with food. Whatever you do start with, it tends to expand when
                    the situation does not respond the way you hope it will and it almost never
                    does. I was asked at that time what my view was of an armed unilateral American
                    intervention in Somalia. I said in words that will be engraved on my tombstone,
                    “If you liked Beirut, you'll love Mogadiscio.” That was the so-called “Tar Baby”
                    cable. That cable of mine was leaked, not by me (although there are people who
                    say I leaked it, but they're either uniformed or lying), to U.S. News and World
                    Report and published in that magazine. That caused a furor here in Washington.
                    Dick Cheney, the Secretary of Defense, got on T.V.; and Larry Eagleburger, who
                    was Deputy Secretary of State, both spoke out. Cheney was particularly strident,
                    I felt, in his attack on me, since I had been asked for my opinion. I was so
                    naive, I figured when people asked for my opinions, they really wanted them,
                    that it was not just a cover your ass program, which I think it was in
                    retrospect. He said two things that were untrue and make me sore to this day. He
                    said that I had opposed humanitarian aid, which I hadn't. There wouldn't have
                    been any if I hadn't gone up there and bent Moi's arm out of shape. He also said
                    that I didn't know anything about Somalia anyway. Well, I never claimed to be a
                    Somali expert, but I was filing a copy out of Somalia in 1957 when Dick Cheney
                    was still in short pants. Eagleburger, who maybe has a better respect for me
                    than Cheney does, was more restrained in his criticism. He said what he had to
                    say, obviously. He said, “Ambassador Hempstone sometimes exaggerates.” I suppose
                    I do.</p>
                <p>My situation at that juncture was, I could either go on head to head with Cheney
                    and Eagleburger, in which case I would have lost, or I could shut up. I chose to
                    shut up, both because I knew I couldn't win and because we had the election
                    coming up in Kenya within six weeks and I felt I had to be there to keep an eye
                    on Moi and his boys to keep it as straight as possible. So, I shut up.</p>
                <p>Q: What were you getting from your embassy? Essentially, your embassy was the
                    closest one to Somalia at that point. Prior to this, using the station chief and
                    your political officers, did you feel yourself sort of a listening post on
                    Somalia?</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Yes. We had one officer (I think his name was John Fox) who had been
                    in the Mogadiscio embassy who was assigned to my embassy to keep a watching
                    brief on Somalia. We sent people in there, mainly CIA and AID people, on an ad
                    hoc basis and got them out again as quickly as possible. We didn't like people
                    spending the night there if we could avoid it. That's what was going on. We were
                    getting some information out of there, but a relatively small number of
                    individuals was involved.</p>
                <p>Q: When the Beirut/Mogadiscio cable occurred, was this essentially something that
                    was supported by those of the rest of your staff who were familiar with
                    Mogadiscio?</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: I think so. It was certainly supported by almost all the people I knew
                    in Kenya. There were a lot of old Somali hands around there, Brits. Anybody who
                    knows the Somalis and knows a little bit of history and remembers the mad mullah
                    and that sort of thing knows when you grab Somalia, you've got a tiger by the
                    tail.</p>
                <p>Q: We put our forces in. I sort of had the feeling that we went in to Mogadiscio
                    really not for great policy considerations, but just the drum beat of the press
                    talking about how awful conditions were there. So, this was one of these almost
                    hasty responses to the emerging of human catastrophe.</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: It was that and the combination of the fact that the U.S. military did
                    not want to go into Bosnia-Herzegovina and hoped that Somalia would be a softer
                    option, which it was, despite the horrible things that happened. It worked
                    pretty well under the Marines when it was a unilateral operation for obvious
                    reasons. Multinational operations are a pain in the ass for everybody, even
                    multi-service ones like the rescue attempt in Iran. But with one service, the
                    Marines, who know each other and know what the drill is and so forth, that
                    worked pretty well. It was in the third phase, the multinational one, that
                    things began to come apart.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find yourself sort of the odd man out? How did you find yourself
                    within the foreign policy establishment having already said this thing wouldn't
                    work? There you are and we're getting deeper and deeper in.</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: I had told them at the time after the exchange with Eagleburger and
                    Cheney and so forth, “I will support the President's position publicly,” which I
                    did. Mainly, I did it by not saying anything. When people asked me questions, I
                    would say, “That is not my bailiwick.” By then, we did have someone in there,
                    Pete De Voss first and then Bob Oakley. When I was [first quoted], there was no
                    American ambassador. There was no embassy there. I would say after De Voss came
                    up, “It's not my bailiwick. I've got enough to do with Kenya. Go ask somebody
                    else.”</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find the Department of State since you had Cheney and Eagleburger down
                    your neck, did they kind of freeze you out? Did you have any feel of that
                    nature?</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Yes, in a sense. I had sought permission seven times to go into
                    Somalia. I thought I could help [General] Lebutti and his Marines, which are my
                    Marines. I was refused and refused in very direct terms one of the seven times
                    by Eagleburger. I am a Marine. I do obey orders if I have to. I thought I did
                    have to. So, I saw Lebutti and his gang off at the airport at dawn and I didn't
                    like it at all. I think there was a chill in the atmosphere after that towards
                    me from some members of the Department, not all by any means. Eagleburger always
                    supported me. Bob Houdek always supported me. There were others that did. There
                    were those who thought I was pressing the policy in Kenya too hard and too fast,
                    so they already regarded me as something of a loose cannon.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: I was not a rogue ambassador in that what I was doing (or at least
                    what I thought I was doing) was implementing the President's policy. But the
                    Kenyan government believed or purported to believe that I was a rogue
                    ambassador, that I was acting on my own. Various individuals said on various
                    occasions, “We have no problem with the United States. We have a problem with
                    Hempstone. He acts on his own.” I said to some of the brighter ones amongst
                    them, including Bethuel Kiplagat, who had been the Permanent Secretary in the
                    Ministry of Foreign Affairs before, a very good man, “I am a political
                    appointee. If I were doing something that President Bush didn't want done, he
                    would have me out of here in five minutes. You know that. So, why do you talk
                    all this nonsense?” It's sort of ironic.</p>
                <p>Q: At a certain point in this operation in Somalia, it did turn into a Beirut
                    type situation of real chaos. We had to leave ruinously. Sometimes being the
                    Cassandra who tells what's going to happen doesn't endear you. How did you find
                    this?</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: I found that true. It didn't endear me to Eagleburger, with whom I
                    always had and still have a good relationship. He wrote the review in The
                    Washington Times of my book. It did not amongst many who served in the Pentagon,
                    some of them regular officers, some of them reserves. When I came back to the
                    United States in 1993, I taught at VMI for a while and I was in touch with a lot
                    of military. They all said, “You were dead right on Somalia. Many of us felt
                    that way at the time,” but being military junior officers, they couldn't
                    say.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: We had had the Saba-Saba thing in July 1990. There continued to be
                    jabbing and sparring, some of it more serious than others. They didn't like my
                    traveling around the countryside talking to people. They weren't used to
                    ambassadors doing that and were also afraid I might learn something, which I
                    did. The well-known substance hit the fan in late 1990 when I went to Kisumu and
                    I called on Oginga Odinga, who was the first vice president of Kenya, but was a
                    non-person really by then. He couldn't travel freely, couldn't speak to the
                    press. If he did speak to the press, the press couldn't publish what he had to
                    say, although he had been guilty of no crime other than being opposed to Daniel
                    arap Moi and Kenyatta before him. Oginga had a reputation of being a leftist,
                    but I always felt that was kind of a silly approach to it. He was a massive
                    capitalist himself, very wealthy. He was an opportunist. If we were going to
                    support Tom Mboya, which we were, who was his great rival amongst the Luo
                    people, then he would then take help where he could get it. He got it from the
                    Russians and the Chinese. At that party, which was also attended by Bishop
                    Okulu, an Anglican bishop who was anti-government, very much in the government's
                    bad book, and other opposition figures, but also other government figures, I
                    invited the provincial commissioner and the local district commissioner.</p>

                <p>HEMPSTONE: Yes. You wouldn't think that an old man in his late 80s attending a
                    party would create banner headlines, but it did. They put out some other
                    extraneous but untrue stuff that I and my staff (because we were again going by
                    land when we left Kisumu and went over to Homa Bay) were cavorting in rough
                    public houses, drinking, wenching, otherwise carrying on. They got everything
                    wrong in that newspaper article except the fact that I was in Homa Bay. They got
                    our license plates wrong. They got the names of the guys who were along wrong.
                    They failed to mention that Kitty was along, so there wasn't much red hot
                    wenching going on. But I was hopping mad. Meanwhile, Bishop Alexander Muge, who
                    was an Anglican bishop, a very fine man, a former GSU (General Services Unit,
                    paramilitary, heavily armed) enlisted man who had been decorated for valor in
                    the fighting against the Somalis after independence, but had turned pretty much
                    opposition, was killed in a “road accident.” It may have been an accident, I
                    don't know. But it was suspicious to many people because a cabinet minister had
                    said that if he visited a certain town, which was within his see, that he would
                    see fire and die, which he did. The cabinet minister did have to resign, but
                    they never established anything. So, I was hopping mad by the time I got to
                    Nairobi. I went to see Kiplagat and said, “Look, I am not really all that
                    concerned about the lies that The Kenya Times tells about me. (I mentioned the
                    editor's name, which now escapes me) I'm not interested in what he said, but I
                    am interested in who is pulling his chain. You know and I know that nothing
                    appears in The Kenyan Times of which the President does not approve. What does
                    that say to me about the type of relations that you people want with me and with
                    the United States? I'm not going to come in here and complain every time this
                    guy, the editor, complains about me because I wouldn't have time to do anything
                    else and neither would you. But I'd be very interested in whether it stops or
                    whether it goes on.” It stopped immediately. I heard nothing from that guy for
                    about two months.</p>
                <p>But there were other instances. They followed me every place I went. The police
                    interviewed everybody I saw and some of them rather roughly. Some of them were
                    totally innocent. A little Lamu innkeeper who I had never known, but I had to
                    stay with, I hadn't been off the island for 10 minutes before they had him down
                    at police headquarters and kept him there for the better part of the day, wanted
                    to know what I had told him and how much money I had given him. Due to their own
                    corruption, they assumed that I was corrupt, too, and so forth. They nailed me
                    for distribution of seditious books to the people of Kenya. These were the same
                    books that USIS had been delivering to Kenya for 20 years, mainly self-help
                    volumes, Up From Slavery, and stuff like that. I responded to that simply by
                    publishing the titles and the names in the local press to show how ludicrous
                    this thing was.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>There came even more problems. There were problems going on between the Brits and
                    the Kenyans. I had gone through three British High Commissioners. Each time,
                    they were improving a bit. Sir John Johnson was terrible in my view. He wanted
                    to stay on in Kenya in his retirement and he wanted to be an adviser to the
                    Kenyan government. The only way he could do that was with Moi's support. The
                    only reason he didn't do it is because his daughter fell very ill and he and
                    Lady Johnson had to go home. Moi was about to fire Richard Leakey as head of the
                    Kenya Wildlife Service. Leakey had been promised carte blanche as far as
                    personnel were concerned. He had discovered that something like at least half
                    the game scouts were corrupt, in league with poachers and everything. He was
                    going to fire them. Well, Moi didn't want them fired. They all were members of
                    constituencies that he needed with elections coming up. About that time, he did
                    agree to legalize the opposition, which is what we had been trying to get him to
                    do all along. I went to see Moi. Queen Elizabeth was coming through there on her
                    way to Harare, where the Commonwealth Prime Ministers Conference was taking
                    place. So, I went and saw Moi and said, “Look, if this demonstration which the
                    opposition has scheduled takes place on the eve of the Queen's visit, there's
                    blood on the streets, and you fire Richard Leakey, your profile in the world is
                    not going to be very good. You know very well that if you instruct the police to
                    use restraint that they will do so. I want you at least to delay this Leakey
                    decision until you have had time to think about it.” He did those two things.
                    The demonstration worked out very well. There was only one person killed and
                    that's not bad. The Queen came and stayed and was able to leave without being
                    embarrassed. Leakey stayed on for the time being.</p>
                <p>But then there was a strong backlash from that. The Foreign Minister called me
                    (the only time he did call me) and tore an enormous strip off me, claiming that
                    I was a drug dealer and that I was providing children with liquor and money to
                    demonstrate against the government and that indeed I was running the opposition.
                    I told him, “Mr. Ayah, if I were running the opposition, it would be running a
                    lot smoother than it is, I can guarantee you that. I don't accept what you have
                    to say.” He said, “I'm going to leave it up to you whether you stay or not.” I
                    said, “I don't accept what you're saying and I feel that my duty requires me to
                    remain here and I will remain here until my President calls me back or your
                    President expels me.” He repeated all these things, really scandalous remarks,
                    in a press conference. The Germans by that time had sent in a new ambassador who
                    was a great help to me. He was my strong right arm in terms of human rights and
                    so forth. The Scandinavians had always supported me, but they didn't have the
                    specific valence that the Germans did. Those guys were worked over by the
                    Foreign Minister also.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>Then they held a whole day's session in Parliament on my merits, which seemed to
                    be few, and my demerits, which were many. At the end of the day, Parliament
                    voted unanimously for my recall, which I will always remember as a badge of
                    honor. At that point, both the White House and the Department really came
                    through in first-rate fashion. The President through his spokesman gave total
                    support to me and so forth. So, there we were. It more or less ended on that
                    note, except we still had the elections to come. They didn't like me worth a
                    darn. They wanted me out of there. But they didn't have the guts to kick me out.
                    Bush was not going to recall me.</p>
                <p>So, up comes election time. This was December of 1992. There was hassling over
                    foreign observers. They turned down a democratic party group here, the Institute
                    for Democracy or something like that. It was run by Brian Atwood, who ended up
                    under Clinton as head of AID. He refused to accept them. I told him, “You are
                    making a mistake here. Should a Democrat be elected, Brian Atwood is likely to
                    have a fairly high powered job in the new administration. I think you ought to
                    reconsider.” He said, “No, I'm not going to take it.” He did accept the
                    Republican crowd. But there were other hassles with other nations. The Germans
                    finally withdrew. I was concerned about the lack of the numbers of foreign
                    observers of which there may have been 150 to have a look at 10,000 polling
                    places. So, just to help a little bit, I've put together embassy teams. There
                    were only 15 of them, four members in each, all volunteers. There were two
                    Americans, a Kenyan driver and a Kenyan interpreter. I sent them out to key
                    constituencies to observe there. I think we had a positive effect. We had white
                    hats made up for us and that sort of thing. I think it also indicates a true
                    basis of the popularity of what I was doing with the rank and file at the
                    embassy. Certain elements did not take part. No CIA guys went because the acting
                    station chief didn't think it was what she wanted them doing. No military people
                    were engaged. All the rest were volunteers. I had 30 Americans and an equal
                    number of Kenyans who were willing to give up their weekend and take some slight
                    risk to observe.</p>
                <p>You know how the election worked out. Moi won the presidency with 36% of the
                    vote. There were three opposition leaders dividing the opposition vote against
                    him. The German ambassador and I told them that this was the sort of thing that
                    would happen if they couldn't agree on a common candidate. Opposition won 88 out
                    of 200 seats in Parliament, which was a pretty good showing for the first
                    election in 25 years. The opposition swept the local council elections. That was
                    it. Moi had eased up a bit on beating up journalists. He started up again after
                    the election.</p>
                <p>Kenya is a different place than it was when I went there in 1989. People are not
                    afraid to talk anymore. They're not afraid to come to the American embassy.
                    There was a time when they were. So, I think we didn't do too badly.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about crime as far as living, not just for you but
                        for thstaff? I've always heard that this was a real problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: It certainly is a problem in Nairobi. It certainly is problem after
                    dark. I haven't been back in Kenya in four years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about the time you were there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: While I was there, that was about it: the problem in Nairobi after
                    dark. You didn't wander around Nairobi after dark, particularly on foot. There
                    were some problems outside of town occasionally.</p>
                <p>Q: What about the staffing of the embassy? There had been at one point (I don't
                    know how it was during your time) a tendency to load all the agencies who wanted
                    to have anybody in Africa in Kenya. Ambassadors had tried to cut that down, to
                    stop the Fish and Wildlife Service from having an attache. Any group in the
                    United States government wanted to send somebody to Kenya. Was this a problem
                    when you were there?</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Yes. I was instructed by the Department (I've forgotten whether it was
                    Eagleburger or Cohen) to resist that, which suited me fine because I wanted to
                    resist it. The FAA wanted to go in there with a big bunch of people. Sometimes
                    there were problems. Mombasa and Nairobi had become big narcotics transfer
                    points. We didn't have any narcs down there. They had to come down from Cairo
                    for it. Sometimes that had the effect of getting my State Department guy in
                    Mombasa involved in narcotics, which frequently was very dangerous and wasn't
                    really his work. So, in some ways, I was of mixed emotion. I would like to see
                    them there; on the other hand, we were trying to keep the lid on that place. But
                    another problem, which was even greater from my point of view, was the tendency
                    of the Department to dump people on Nairobi who were problem people, many of
                    them single mothers. I said, “Look, you can't keep doing this. I don't mind
                    minorities. Send me all the blacks and Hispanics you want. But send me decent
                    people who don't have terrible problems. Otherwise, you're going to ruin this
                    embassy.” Well, they didn't do that. After I left, I think of the 20 top people,
                    14 of them were women and they did not get on with each other and they made a
                    mess out of the embassy. The morale was once sky high. Morale is now low,
                    particularly since the bombing of the embassy.</p>
                <p>Q: I was in Personnel at one point. This was back in the 1960s. All of a sudden,
                    we kind of came up short because every time we had a problem case, they'd say,
                    “Let's send them to London or Paris because they can absorb it.” There is a
                    personnel saturation point. There is a tendency to do this. Kenya was considered
                    one of the...</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Cohen told me that specifically when I said, “You've got to stop doing
                    this.” He said, “I can't because I can't send them to Ouagadougou. They're a
                    real problem. You can absorb them.” As you say, you can't absorb them after a
                    while.</p>
                <p>Q: You left there with the change of administration. It was actually a normal
                    tour. Did you find that the new administration was at all interested? Was it
                    “Here is your flag” and “Nice to see you?” Did you have much of a chance to talk
                    to the new group?</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: No. I talked to various groups like FSI, but certainly not to the
                    political administration. As you know, many people in the Department rightly or
                    wrongly are opposed to political appointees anyway. So, I pretty much got the
                    flag and a bottle of warm champagne and went out the door. The rest, as they
                    say, is history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Since you left there, what have you been up to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: I taught for a year at VMI [Virginia Military Institute] and in
                    Sewanee. Then I wrote this book Rogue Ambassador: An African Memoire, which is
                    more or less to set straight the record on some of these things. That has had
                    the same sort of reception that I had personally. That is, it has many vigorous
                    proponents, particularly amongst the younger officers, although I sold the book
                    personally to nine ambassadors and they were all in opposition.</p>
                <p>My own feelings are mixed on the thing. I if I were offered another post if a
                    Republican wins, would I take it? I don't know whether I would or not. I got
                    awfully tired of some of that bureaucratic stuff.</p>
                <p>Q: I know what you mean. I'm a professional Foreign Service officer and I'm
                    absolutely delighted to be outside the system and being doing what I want on my
                    own. I have an appreciation for America's role in foreign policy, but how one
                    goes about it at the nitty gritty gets difficult.</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: I don't know the answer to that. Foreign Affairs, the Bible of the
                    foreign policy establishment, excerpted my part about the Foreign Service and
                    also part about foreign aid. On Foreign Service, I declared myself perplexed
                    that I know these guys are all very bright in an academic sense. After all, you
                    have maybe 200 people selected from about 14,000. But somewhere along the line,
                    they lose something. What do they lose? I think it's because the Department,
                    like most institutions, does not really welcome innovative and risk-taking
                    policies. They'd much rather have a guy who's safe, who will go on with the act,
                    do his job, what's technically required of him, and so you lose something. Maybe
                    they should be all political ambassadors over 60 who have no future and aren't
                    afraid to do what they think is right.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>Q: I saw an excerpt where you mentioned something which troubles me, too, because
                    I interview many people who become ambassadors. That is that moving to the top
                    often depends on being close to the flagpole, people who work as assistants or
                    they work with the National Security Council or as assistants to heads of
                    bureaus or in Personnel. These are staff jobs. Alright, but people who make a
                    career working in this type of thing, really, this is not what foreign service
                    should be. The strength should be that somebody knows Germany very, very well,
                    and knows how something will play in Washington.</p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Yes. Maybe the tours should be longer. What do yothink?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't know. It's difficult. There are all sorts of
                        problems.Why don't we stop at this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEMPSTONE: Okay. Thank you, Mr. Kennedy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thank you.</hi>
