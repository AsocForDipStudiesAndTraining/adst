                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: June 26, 1992</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is June 26, 1992. This is an interview with Stanley
                        I. Grand on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies, and I am
                        Charles Stuart Kennedy. Could you give me a little bit about your
                        background—when, where you were born, grew up and education?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: I was born in New York City on August 7, 1920. I went to the University of
                    Wisconsin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did you go to the University of Wisconsin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: Well, I was raised during the New Deal days and everybody was very
                    interested in what was going on in the Roosevelt administration. The University
                    of Wisconsin was a leader in much of what was happening under the New Deal in
                    those days because of the progressive background of the state and because of the
                    University's excellent reputation. In addition to all that they offered me a
                    scholarship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know two people—Sam Berger and Ben Stephansky both went
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: Right. Ben and I first became good friends then, as a matter of fact. This
                    friendship continues.</p>
                <p>After graduating from the university I entered government service working for the
                    Social Security Board in Madison, Wisconsin. Then I came to Washington,
                    originally as an economist with the OPA and then I went to work with the Office
                    of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs. Then I entered the Army.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you enter the Army?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>GRAND: In 1943. I served in Italy and was discharged in 1945 and went back to
                    what was a successor agency to the Office of Inter-American Affairs. Truman had
                    decided to combine the information functions of the OWI (Office of War
                    Information) and the Office of Inter-American Affairs into what became the
                    Office of Information and Cultural Affairs of the State Department. This
                    ultimately became the USIA. My job initially was in the Bureau of Inter-American
                    Affairs for a couple of years. Then I went to Peru, which was my first overseas
                    assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now that we are getting into the guts of it, lets go
                        back...having served in Italy, did this give you a feel for wanting to get
                        involved in foreign affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: Quite frankly, I don't think the Italian experience gave me much of an
                    interest in anything except surviving. I went over to Italy as an infantry
                    replacement, a private. When I got there I was put into a replacement depot and
                    then assigned to a combat intelligence team operating out of Headquarters which
                    was then in Rome. I became a private first class because when you went into
                    combat you were automatically promoted to private first class. That was the
                    reason I was promoted.</p>
                <p>When I was discharged from the Army the job I had waiting for me was in the State
                    Department's Bureau of Inter-American Affairs. That was an interesting period
                    because we went through the process of first building up the information and
                    cultural program in Latin America and then, within a year of that, Congress
                    decided to brutally cut the program. I remember spending a terrible Summer
                    speaking to top-flight people who were being fired. The only reason they were
                    being fired was because we weren't getting enough money from Congress. It didn't
                    make me feel any better to know that while I was interviewing them they were
                    probably wondering why I still had a job. The reason why I had my job was really
                    quite simple. I was a 10 point veteran and had permanent civil service status,
                    which given the way the law reduction in force procedures were set up probably
                    meant that the Secretary of State could get fired before I could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A ten point veteran meant that you had been wounded?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: It meant one of three things for those of us who served in Italy. It meant
                    you either got shot, an incurable venereal disease, or pneumonia. I got
                    pneumonia which brought on asthma which resulted in my being discharged for
                    medical reasons.</p>
                <p>At any rate, after a year or so Congress reversed itself and we began to rebuild
                    the program. It was an interesting time integrating a new function—the
                    information program—into the State Department. The Department had a Cultural
                    Affairs Office, which had been there for some time, but there had not been much
                    experience with an overseas information program. This was an opportunity to do
                    many new things.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>Given the way Congress operates, at one point the Information and Cultural
                    Program (OIC) didn't have much money and therefore needed help from the State
                    Department. A year or two later the State Department didn't have much money, and
                    therefore looked to the OIC for help in placing excess officers.</p>
                <p>One of the results of this was that I was able to persuade the Foreign
                    Service—for the first time—to agree to sending a woman officer overseas with a
                    dependent child. The Department in the late forties, was not interested
                    particularly in women officers and its policy was to not send overseas a female
                    officer with a dependent child. We were able to in effect blackmail the Foreign
                    Service into letting us do this because we told them we wouldn't put some of
                    their excess male Foreign Service officers into the information program if they
                    wouldn't let us send female officers with dependents overseas.</p>
                <p>I was also able to persuade the Foreign Service into allowing us, again for the
                    first time, to send a female officer overseas who was married to a dependent
                    male. This the Department again didn't like to do. But we were able to say that
                    we would take so-and-so, whom you really have no place for, provided you would
                    do this. Although the Department balked at these changes, we just stalled for
                    time until minds were changed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There is a lot of horse trading...if you don't do what I
                        say we won't do such and such...in the personnel field.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: Not only in the personnel field, it works in practically every field in
                    the State Department, and I am not sure the State Department bureaucracy is any
                    different in that respect then any other bureaucracy, both public and private. I
                    think there is often a question of dealing. For example, during that period we
                    were trying to get out a basic policy paper on Latin America, mainly for use by
                    the information program. I had prepared a very long dispatch ...that is probably
                    a word not many people know any more, but before we had telegrams and before
                    airgrams, which were shortened written communications rather than electronically
                    communicated communications...we had dispatches which were written in a rather
                    formal fashion to and from the field. I had prepared a long dispatch on this
                    subject and it had gone through the process of clearances ...just a word on the
                    process of clearances in the State Department or in most bureaucracies. What
                    happens normally is that you, as an individual officer, on your own initiative
                    or on the instructions of your superior, prepare a dispatch or telegram, or some
                    communication, and then proceed to get that document cleared with whatever
                    Offices in the State Department may have an interest in it, for one reason or
                    another. Once you get these clearances it is signed off by a superior officer
                    and then it will go out to the field.</p>
                <p>I had worked for about five or six months on this policy paper for Latin America
                    and suddenly the Bogota Conference was coming up.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the very famous one that Marshall went to in
                        1947.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: Marshall was there with his aide Bedell Smith who was Under Secretary of
                    State and later became head of the CIA. All of a sudden everybody was scrambling
                    for a policy paper for the Bogota Conference. Since this long paper which I had
                    written was just about cleared, it fell upon me to write a telegram based on the
                    paper and it went out very quickly because all the other clearances had been
                    done. By sheer happenstance, I wrote what was basically the basic policy for the
                    Bogota Conference. But it wasn't that this had been planned. It had just
                    evolved. I think it is very important to understand that this happens very often
                    in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>I can give you another excellent example of this...the so-called Point Four
                    Program of President Truman. There was a man, whose name I don't recall, who had
                    been in the Coordinator's Office when I had been there before I went into the
                    Army. He had been sent by the Coordinator's Office to Brazil during the war. He
                    came back to Washington and was just sitting around the Bureau waiting for a new
                    assignment. He was a very good speech writer. At one point the word came down
                    that Truman was looking for something special to say in his inauguration speech
                    and that new ideas would be welcome.</p>
                <p>This fellow sat down and wrote a speech and came up with various points that
                    Truman might want to use...he wrote the speech in other words. It had contained
                    the famous Point Four Program which was based basically on this man's knowledge
                    of what the Coordinator's Office had been doing in the field of technical
                    assistance in Latin America. It was one of those speeches that moved through the
                    bureaucracy with everybody thinking it was going to be stopped. However, it
                    ultimately ended up in Truman's hands and was used. Well, when the Point Four
                    Program was started, this man ended up as the number two man in the Program,
                    mainly because nobody else knew what in the world the Program was all about.</p>
                <p>In many of these areas, it seems to me, happenstance plays a tremendous role if
                    you just happen to be in the right place at the right time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And with an idea.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: The idea is frequently a result of the circumstance itself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Rockefeller still with this program when you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>GRAND: No. Rockefeller was there before I went into the Army. But when I came out
                    of the Army, Rockefeller had left and most of his Office's functions had been
                    incorporated into State. The information programs were combined with the OWI and
                    State's Office of Cultural Affairs. The technical programs were put under a
                    Committee for Scientific and Technical Cooperation. This committee basically
                    oversaw all of US technical assistance overseas. The coordination of the huge
                    technical assistance program in Latin America was wedded into this committee. In
                    addition, the State Department's cultural program also received some of its
                    funding from this committee. Olcott Deming was the Executive Secretary of that
                    committee. I remember Deming with his small little group running what later
                    became a worldwide technical assistance program. Of course it was taken away
                    from them after Point Four came into existence and, of course, a huge
                    bureaucracy replaced this small committee.</p>
                <p>Anyway, to get back to me, I left ARA in 1948 to go out to Lima, Peru as press
                    attach�.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going back there is just one other thing...the war is
                        over, the State Department was gearing up to play a new role which is
                        certainly far different from the minor role we had in the world prior to
                        World War II, but what was your impression coming into this of how the
                        Foreign Service or the old hands of the State Department were responding to
                        public affairs, technical assistance, all of which were not real Foreign
                        Service type things? Before it had been the consular work that was sort of
                        off to one side, or political or economic reporting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: Well, it varied. You would deal with people in the Bureau, some of whom
                    were about my own age with similar experiences, some had been in the military,
                    some not. Age was a factor. There were less problems with younger people. People
                    like Hank Dearborn, Henry Hoyt. We were all about the same age and at the same
                    level. But in addition you had to adjust to the entrenched State Department
                    mechanism. There was a lady, Miss Lincoln, in the State Department whose
                    function was to make sure that any dispatch or communication that went out from
                    the Department to the field followed certain forms. You might work on something
                    for a long time, or you might have a cable that had to get out right away, and
                    if she didn't like the form it was in, it didn't go out. She had complete power.
                    It was amazing. I was fortunate because she decided that I would become a good
                    drafting officer if only I would follow certain rules, etc. I had enough sense
                    then to realize that it would be useless to argue with this lady, so instead I
                    cultivated her. And it was wonderful, all my stuff moved out very quickly as a
                    consequence. But it was difficult for many new people to adjust to this sort of
                    thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>One of the things that anybody studying the State Department today would probably
                    find hard to understand, was the tremendous power that the desk officer used to
                    have. The desk officer covered one country. In those days, he had absolute
                    control over that country in terms of everything going in or out of that country
                    in the way of communications and in the way of personnel. If a desk officer
                    didn't like somebody, unless that somebody had a lot of political power and was
                    coming in as a political individual, the desk officer could stop him just by
                    saying no. And there were no intermediaries between the desk officer and the
                    assistant secretaries. There were no office directors and assistant office
                    directors. A desk officer reported directly to an assistant secretary or his
                    deputy. And he went where the assistant secretary and his deputy went. That was
                    a unique feature which doesn't exist anymore. It disappeared rather rapidly.</p>
                <p>The only place that it continued to exist for some period...it came up later on
                    in my career...was in the Office of United Nations Political Affairs. The reason
                    it lasted there was because of the fact that we had an Ambassador at the United
                    Nations, Henry Cabot Lodge, who was a Cabinet officer and a close friend of the
                    President. Whenever you sent him a cable, particularly on the item which I was
                    handling and I will talk about later, disarmament, you could be assured that
                    within five minutes of the cable being received Lodge would be on the phone
                    screaming to the President about it. The President would have to call Dulles. As
                    a consequence, every cable that I sent out in those two years was cleared by the
                    Secretary mainly because he knew the President was going to be calling him to
                    find out what was going on.</p>
                <p>But normally, at that period of time, in the late '50s, no low ranking officer
                    was dealing directly with the higher policy levels of the State Department.
                    Whereas in the late forties, that was the norm.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went to Lima as the press officer. What was the
                        situation in Lima at the time? You were there from 1948-51.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: Shortly after I got to Lima we had a change of government. A revolution
                    took place. The Apristas, which was a populist political party, was thrown out
                    and the military took over. The leader of the Apristas, Haya de la Torre, went
                    into the Colombian embassy to seek asylum. The normal procedure then was that an
                    individual was given asylum and then he was given a safe conduct to leave the
                    country. This didn't happen in the case of Peru because there was a young, very
                    popular Lt. Colonel, who had a tremendous amount of power at that time. He had
                    earlier tried to take over the government but was unsuccessful. When the
                    military revolution came along a couple of weeks later that did work, he was
                    brought back from exile and became Minister of the Interior.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>He warned that if the government agreed to give Haya de la Torre a safe conduct
                    from the Colombian embassy, he would go in with a machine gun and kill him. He
                    was sufficiently unstable so that he probably would have done just that and the
                    government was sufficiently unstable so that it couldn't possibly fight him
                    since he had a very populist image. So Haya de la Torre stayed in the Colombian
                    embassy until the middle '50s, as I recall, before he was released.</p>
                <p>But we had a military government there for all the period that I was there. It
                    was my first assignment overseas and it was a thoroughly satisfactory
                    experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: The ambassador was Harold Tittmann. A wonderful man. He had been a hero
                    during World War I. He had been shot down, pulled out of a burning airplane and
                    managed to survive. He lost the use of one arm and lost a leg. He was a
                    delightful career Foreign Service officer. Very intelligent. He knew how to run
                    an embassy. I think he was probably the reason why I decided to stay in the
                    Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do as a press officer in Peru before and
                        after the coup?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: Well, during the period there I was not only the press officer, but also
                    the information officer. We had an information program going in press, radio and
                    motion pictures under which we put on pro-US programs using those three media
                    countrywide. That was when I first learned the importance of personal
                    relationships in Latin America. You really can only operate effectively in Latin
                    America after you have established close personal relationships. It doesn't
                    really matter what the laws are or anything else. You can not get things done
                    well in Latin America unless you have extensive personal contacts. After a few
                    years in Peru, I had gotten to the point where I could have a US presidential
                    speech broadcast with translation almost simultaneously without any cost to the
                    United States government on every radio station in Peru on very short notice
                    just became I was a good friend of the owners of the radio stations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask a question. You say personal relationship. Here
                        you are sent to Peru. How do you get to know the people? How do you develop
                        these relationships?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>GRAND: Well, what I did first was to develop my Spanish proficiency. Then...I am
                    a fairly outgoing person, I like people and I just managed to get to know a lot
                    of them. What it took was getting out of the Embassy. A lot of people go to an
                    embassy and just sit there for two or three years and read the newspapers and
                    report on what is going on from what they have read in the newspapers. I don't
                    think that is the way one ought to operate and certainly it wasn't the way I
                    operated. I spent most of my of time with human beings. With people in Peru.
                    This meant giving up sleep. I averaged about four hours of sleep a night in the
                    time I was there. I ended up in the Bethesda Naval Hospital with amoebas in my
                    liver, but I think this was a fair price to pay for getting the job done.</p>
                <p>As a consequence, I got very close to the family that ran El Commercio, the
                    leading newspaper there. I actually became part of the Miro Quesada family
                    because one of my sons was born in Peru, and one of the Miro Quesadas ended up
                    as the godfather of my son. Peru is a closed society. It is almost a tribal
                    society, or was then. Many people in the Embassy didn't like Peru as a
                    consequence because it was difficult to get to know people. I think I was
                    sufficiently young and maybe naive so that I felt that people would like me and
                    be willing to communicate with me. I just went ahead and made friends. That made
                    my official life very simple. I could do all kinds of things in the country just
                    because I had good contacts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our interests in Peru?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: We were interested in just basic Latin American interests. We were not as
                    concerned then as we are today with representative government in Latin America.
                    I think we still operated on the basis of the old Roosevelt Doctrine. At one
                    point Roosevelt was discussing the various dictators around Latin America that
                    existed at that time and somebody said, “Oh, they're just a bunch of bastards.”
                    And Roosevelt said, “Yes, but they're our bastards.” And I think we were still
                    going on that basis while I was in Peru. We had no problems dealing with Odria
                    who was the president all the time that I was there.</p>
                <p>Our interests were concerned with protecting American investment in Peru, which
                    were very substantial. In terms of minerals, Peru had been a very important
                    source of copper and silver and petroleum. One of the things we were trying to
                    do then was to open up development of Peruvian petroleum by US petroleum
                    interests. We didn't succeed in that. It was a very hot political issue tied in
                    with the fact that the government that had preceded the revolution, the
                    Apristas, had made a concession to one of the US corporations. When the
                    revolution took place and the military took over, El Comercio, which was owned
                    by people I was very close to, opposed US investment in the petroleum in the
                    area because: (1) one of their family members had been assassinated by the
                    Apristas and (2) they were highly nationalistic and did not want foreign
                    investment. Accordingly, our objective of furthering U.S. investment in
                    petroleum exploitation was not achieved.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>One of the things we did do that was an example of bureaucracy gone absolutely
                    mad resulted from the fact that after World War II we had a large number of
                    Peruvian pesos available for our use in the Treasury Department. Somebody got
                    the very bright idea of using that money to provide sterling silverware for our
                    embassies worldwide. Peru did excellent work on silverware and at a low price.
                    It was a good notion. The Department sent down an architectural attach� to
                    handle this operation. He put the thing up for bids by all Peruvian
                    manufacturers of sterling silverware. One of the best known silver companies in
                    Peru was called Casa Welch. There was a joke around the embassy that Casa Welch
                    was on the blacklist two weeks before we had a blacklist. Casa Welch was the
                    center for all Nazi operations on the West coast of Latin America. It was well
                    known for this. I discovered the day before the bids were to be contracted that
                    Casa Welch had come in with the lowest bid. Obviously they were going to come in
                    with the lowest bid if they could have their name on silverware used in every US
                    embassy in the world. That certainly would take care of the negative reputation
                    it had because it had been on the blacklist during World War II.</p>
                <p>I spoke with the Ambassador about this problem. He couldn't believe it, went
                    through the roof, called the State Department and screamed and yelled. Nothing
                    happened. If you go to any US embassy and they serve you with the fine silver,
                    turn it over and you will see Casa Welch. It was a disgusting thing that we did,
                    but we did it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously you had this close connection with El Comercio,
                        but what about other papers. I have often heard in many countries that
                        publicity is sort of up for purchase. Did you find that you had to give quid
                        pro quos or even pay or something to get American items of value to us in
                        other papers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: I didn't have to do that in Peru. There were two principal newspapers, El
                    Comercio and La Prensa. La Prensa was run by a man called Pedro Beltran. The
                    Department adored Pedro Beltran because; he had been to Harvard; he spoke
                    English well; and he said all the right things. His paper was being run by a
                    former member of the Communist Party who publicly recanted and left the
                    party.</p>
                <p>I didn't particularly like Pedro, but it really didn't matter. We worked with his
                    paper until I got annoyed and went to see the Ambassador at one point and said,
                    “Pedro Beltran's newspaper is spreading Communist propaganda.” The Ambassador
                    said, “That can't be.” I said, “Well, I think it is.” For one month, I clipped
                    out of La Prensa and El Comercio headlines and pictures of prominent news
                    stories.At the end of that month I was able to go the Ambassador and say, “If
                    you read La Prensa, you will get the Communist slant on every prominent news
                    story and here is the proof of it.” We sent it to the Department but nobody
                    seemed interested.</p>
                <p>We did not have to, in the case of Peru, spend money to get the newspaper
                    coverage we wanted. In other cases, in other countries that I was in, we did
                    have to do it, and so we did.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Lima in 1951, is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: When I left Lima I was being transferred as press attach� to Tehran. I got
                    as far as Washington on consultation and bumped into Eddie Miller, who was then
                    the Assistant Secretary for Latin America, and whom I knew well. He wondered
                    what I was doing in Washington and I told him that I was on my way to Tehran. He
                    said, “No you are not.” So I ended up in Washington handling the information
                    program for Middle America. That was during the time of the overthrow of the
                    Arbenz administration in Guatemala, so I was involved in that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what the Arbenz situation was in
                        Guatemala? This was a very controversial situation and how did we put the
                        best light on it for the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: Well, for the first time in Latin America we had what appeared to be a
                    Communist-dominated government. We had gone through the Rio Treaty
                    modifications, etc. to try to avert this kind of thing. We had a serious
                    situation on our hands. What was done then, which was not done later on in the
                    case of Nicaragua, for example, was a very well conceived program of informing
                    the American people as to what was going on in Guatemala. We had a very well
                    thought out plan for utilizing the US press to get our point of view across to
                    the American public as to what we saw in Guatemala in the way of a Communist
                    threat. We also had a program to get Congressional backing by providing
                    Congressmen with speeches designed to foster our overall objective of public
                    support for our future actions.</p>
                <p>We also had going for us the beginning of the Cold War and a certain amount of
                    national hysteria concerning the Communist menace since this. It coincided with
                    the time of Joe McCarthy.</p>
                <p>It was not a good time for the State Department. We all had to be reinvestigated
                    by the FBI and get new clearances, which most of us did. Some people were
                    terribly damaged by McCarthy. One officer I know, who was an excellent officer,
                    got so fed up because he knew the kind of false charges that might be brought
                    against him, that he committed suicide. It was a tragedy and should not have
                    happened. McCarthyism was just a terrible time. You were subject to
                    interrogation about not only your political beliefs, but also your personal
                    habits, as so the rule of thumb, in terms of sexual activities was neither
                    normal nor abnormal except with your wife, and then you must not enjoy it. It
                    was a terrible time.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>But for what we were able to do, the time helped, which was certainly not so in
                    the case of Nicaragua. Also we came up with some pretty coherent stories. It
                    might be interesting for somebody to look into the white paper which was
                    published by the United States government at that time. The White Paper on
                    Guatemala included such things as a shipboard transfer of arms from the Eastern
                    Bloc, which eventually arrived in Guatemala. If you look at the Nicaraguan White
                    Paper which came out at that time it is almost identical with the Guatemalan
                    paper, except that instead of having the arms come by ship they came by truck
                    from Central America. I suppose it was a tribute to my drafting skills on the
                    Guatemala paper that 35 years later the Department used almost the same paper
                    just changing the country's name. Perhaps part of the reason the Nicaraguan
                    escapade was not as successful was that the White House crew just wasn't as
                    imaginative as we had been.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you aware of the American CIA implicity in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: I was part of a State Department team that worked with the CIA on
                    this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this something you had to work around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: Not at all. I think people are always mislead about how great the CIA
                    operations are. I will give you a good example. During the Guatemalan problem
                    when things were just about ready to go, two Guatemalan labor leaders decided to
                    defect. They were down in a little town right across the border from Guatemala
                    in southern Mexico. We really wanted to speak to them in Washington. We were
                    anxious to get them. The CIA people said they would use their channels and get
                    them up to Washington right away.</p>
                <p>So using their own communication channels they spoke to their people in Mexico
                    City and told them to get the Guatemalans here right away. Two days went by and
                    we didn't hear anything. We were all getting rather impatient so we asked the
                    CIA to query what was going on. They got back a cable which said, “Your original
                    cable arrived at such and such a time on such and such a date. If you will check
                    the schedule you will see that the regular airplane connection between Mexico
                    City and the particular small town where the two were, left ten minutes before
                    your cable arrived and there won't be another flight for a week.”</p>
                <p>You wondered what kind of world these guys were living in. The CIA sent down a
                    cable telling them to charter a plane. So when people think of the CIA as a very
                    effective mechanism, they might want to think again. As a matter of fact, I was
                    concerned about that as you will see later on in my career after I left the
                    Service and went to work for Lyndon Johnson.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>When the Kennedy administration first came in I met with Adolf Berle, who had
                    been brought in to handle Latin America. We were talking about the Cuban problem
                    and I said to him, “Look, if you decide to go on this, don't depend on the
                    magic, they are not that good.” I told him what had happened in Guatemala. He
                    said, “Well, I know about using power.” I said, “Yes, I know you do.” He had
                    written a marvelous book on power politics. Well, he obviously didn't follow up
                    on his own book because you had the Bay of Pigs, which was a fiasco. I think he
                    depended in large part on the CIA. I don't really have a high opinion of the
                    CIA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Most of these attempts to subvert or spy don't work very
                        well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: I think part of the problem is that the CIA, certainly now, and even then
                    back in the early '50s when it was first getting started, just became too
                    bureaucraticized and does not have the capability of moving fast when things
                    have to be done. I don't subscribe to the notion that it is impossible to carry
                    out effectively covert actions in a democracy. I think you can. I don't think we
                    have the proper mechanism for doing so. I believe that is a big lack. Since we
                    are the only super power left in the world we should be able to use all of the
                    resources of a super power including covert activities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What else were you doing besides working on the
                        information, damage control of the Arbenz business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: Well, that was basically it. I handled Middle American Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You use Middle America, what does that mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: Middle America then was all of Central America, plus the Caribbean. That
                    was the way the State Department was broken up in those days. I was responsible
                    then for personnel actions such as moving people in and out of Middle America
                    for the information and cultural program, as well as policy direction of the
                    Department's information and cultural activities in Middle America.</p>
                <p>It was during that period that the USIA was established outside of the State
                    Department and we were offered a choice. We could either go with USIA or stay in
                    the State Department. I stayed in State. The State Department then became the
                    policy control for the USIA operations in Latin America and maintained the
                    cultural program in Latin America. USIA then became operational.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>During that period the Wriston program came along, which was a program for
                    integrating officers into the Foreign Service. I was 34 years old when I was
                    integrated into the career Foreign Service as a Class-3 officer and sent abroad
                    in 1955 to Brazil. I went there initially as a political officer in the Embassy
                    but when I got there I was moved into the economic section as transportation
                    officer and had the misfortune to run up against some strange human beings in
                    the Embassy. The DCM and I didn't get along. Nor did I get along with the
                    Counselor for Economic Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what you mean by didn't get along, just
                        to give a feel for the situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: Basically I felt that I had a non job. I had gone down there as political
                    officer, but the DCM decided he wanted somebody else in the Embassy to be the
                    political officer. I was put into a job which had really no significance. It
                    didn't keep me very busy. I had a Brazilian secretary who handled most of the
                    routine and when I left there I recommended that the job be eliminated. It was
                    eliminated temporarily, but later restored. The man who was put into the job was
                    willing to go along with this nonsense. He ultimately ended up as Ambassador to
                    Brazil.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: Jack Crimmins. Jack came to see me when he was going down to take the job
                    and I said, “Jack, I told everybody then that my secretary could handle it.
                    There is not enough work there.” He had not been out in the field and had been
                    integrated into the Foreign Service from a desk job in the intelligence area. He
                    was anxious to get field experience and willing to take the job.</p>
                <p>One of the things I did learn from that assignment, which may be useful for other
                    people is the importance of humor and how you can sometimes get things done in
                    the Department by indirection. At that time the Ex-Im Bank was determined to
                    make a loan to a railroad in Brazil. It was a loan which the Embassy had opposed
                    because it was a silly loan. We had gone strongly on record as opposing the
                    loan, but Ex-Im was determined to go ahead with it.</p>
                <p>Well, I decided the only way to do something about this was to ridicule the
                    thing. So I wrote a long airgram to the State Department based on the startling
                    fact that the railroad had gone for one full week without an accident. I made a
                    very comical report on this that I knew everybody would laugh about. For the
                    first time people weren't falling off the trains and getting killed.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>It was, unlike much of the boring stuff that comes into the State Department,
                    amusing and when something like that comes in it gets circulated. This went all
                    over the place. As a consequence when the head of the Ex-Im Bank tried to bring
                    it up to his Board to make a loan to this railroad, everybody laughed at him.
                    The loan was defeated. And that was the purpose of my airgram. Reason had failed
                    but humor won.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this sit with the powers to be within the Embassy?
                        Did they feel you were undercutting them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: No, no, quite to the contrary, the Embassy wanted that done. The Embassy
                    had opposed that loan, so it was happy with the dispatch. Ex-Im was going off on
                    their own, you see.</p>
                <p>However one of the problems I had with the Embassy resulted from a serious fight
                    between the Brazilian government and the United States government over
                    interpretation of a bilateral air agreement. They—the Brazilians—were
                    interpreting the air agreement unilaterally and making Pan American do a
                    dog-leg, which is kind of an off the route flight over a certain point saying
                    that is what the agreement called for. Pan American had asked us to try to get
                    the Brazilians to change it. We had gone through the normal procedure of sending
                    in notes and meeting with people and the Brazilians weren't going to do anything
                    about it.</p>
                <p>One day I decided the hell with it. I had gotten to be friends with Ruben Beata,
                    who was the president of the Brazilian owned Varig airlines at that time. I was
                    having lunch with him one day and I said, “Do you know, if this dog-leg business
                    continues, since there is a provision in the agreement allowing you to make a
                    non-revenue stop in Puerto Rico, we may just have to require that you do that on
                    every flight you make to the United States.” Berta said, “Is that serious?” And
                    I said, “Yes, it is very serious and I think I may just have to recommend this
                    to the Department.” He was very upset and worried about this.</p>
                <p>Very shortly a couple of things happened. One, the Brazilians agreed to eliminate
                    the dog-leg and two, my boss, the Counselor of Economic Affairs, asked me what
                    had happened. So I told him. He said, “How did you dare do this on your own?” I
                    said, “Well, it just seemed to be a way of getting something done.” I then met
                    with the DCM who also castigated me for doing this on my own and said that he
                    was probably going to recommend a reprimand for me. Things got a little bit
                    hairy.</p>
                <p>I then quietly met with the vice president for Pan American in Rio and told him
                    what was happening. Shortly after that a communication came in from the State
                    Department. The Secretary had received a letter from Juan Trippe, the president
                    of Pan American Airlines, congratulating me and thanking the State Department
                    for its action in eliminating the dog-leg. It didn't make me very popular in
                    certain areas of the Embassy. But I didn't get a reprimand.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: Jimmy Dunn was the Ambassador. He had been Ambassador in Spain. Clare
                    Boothe Luce, who had been Ambassador in Italy was supposed to go to Brazil, but
                    during her hearings she accused Senator Wayne Morse of having been kicked in the
                    head by a horse, which accounted for his erratic behavior. As a consequence her
                    nomination was withdrawn and Dunn, who was on the point of retiring as
                    Ambassador, was persuaded to come over to Rio because the Department had had to
                    drop the Clare Boothe Luce nomination on a crash basis. He agreed to come over
                    for a year. He didn't really care what was going on there. What he really wanted
                    to do was to retire in Italy, and when he left Rio he didn't even go back to
                    Washington, he went directly to Italy to retire.</p>
                <p>So he was the Ambassador there for the time I was there. Then I came up to
                    Washington because I was having some personal problems. I was offered a job in
                    the Foreign Service Institute which I agreed to take. I was assigned to work on
                    the senior course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was from 1956-61?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: No, from 1956-57 I worked on the senior course with a man by the name of
                    Cyril Hager who had been brought in to set up the course. He had been
                    Educational Advisor to the Commandant at the Air War College. I worked with him
                    later with Max Bishop, who had been Ambassador to Thailand and had come back to
                    work on this before retiring.</p>
                <p>I then was assigned to United Nations Political Affairs where I handled
                    disarmament questions at the United Nations General Assembly. I also was
                    responsible for outer space. I did that for a year and a half and then retired
                    from the State Department. I was selected out and offered early retirement or a
                    law suit. I took early retirement.</p>
                <p>I then went to work for Lyndon Johnson. Sam Houston, his brother, and I were very
                    good friends and I knew Lyndon Johnson rather well. He offered me a job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can we go back to the UN thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: During the General Assembly you have various items that come up. I was the
                    item officer on disarmament, which meant that I originated cables from
                    Washington to the Mission telling the Mission what we should be doing on
                    disarmament and the peaceful uses of outer space. All of my cables, as I
                    indicated earlier, were cleared by the Secretary. After Dulles died it was
                    Herter.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>It was an exciting time because it was the longest and probably most useful
                    debate in UN history on disarmament. Henry Cabot Lodge was an interesting
                    personality. During the General Assembly session we would constantly ride the
                    shuttle between Washington and New York. Very frequently we would send a cable
                    out in the afternoon and then take the plane up that evening and be there in the
                    morning for Henry Cabot Lodge's staff meetings, which were always sort of
                    amusing. When I was there the headquarters used to be on Park Avenue. He was
                    then on a fresh air kick...”You need fresh air. If you don't have fresh air you
                    can't think,” he would say. So we would walk into his staff conference room...I
                    think it was on the 30th floor in this building on Park Avenue...and in the
                    middle of winter all the windows would be open. Snow would come in occasionally.
                    At times people would stutter and he would say, “Speak up, speak up.” Well, they
                    were cold and shivering so they stuttered.</p>
                <p>I guess, USUN Ambassadors always have the notion that they are running things and
                    therefore get annoyed with cables from Washington. They are not. UN Ambassadors
                    take instructions from the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lodge, I think, was particularly...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: Lodge, especially, because he had been so close to the President. After
                    all he was the one who ran his campaign. And he was a Cabinet member. Bush
                    always talked about what he did at the UN. Well, anyone who handles UN political
                    affairs knows that they operated on the basis of cables from the Department.
                    Lodge didn't like this. His favorite little act at his morning staff meeting
                    (and he knew who was handling each item, obviously) was to hold up a cable he
                    disagreed with and he would say, “I am going to find out who is this faceless
                    bureaucrat with a passion for anonymity who keeps sending me these cables.” You
                    would be sitting there and know that he knew who it was. It was just an annoying
                    game.</p>
                <p>I will tell you another funny story about how foreign policy is made by
                    happenstance. We finally negotiated an agreement with the Soviet Union on the
                    peaceful uses of outer space. After all, we were behind the Soviet Union at that
                    point. This was the late '50s when they had a sputnik up and we were still
                    blowing our noses. We got an agreement to establish in the UN an ad hoc
                    committee on the peaceful uses of outer space.</p>
                <p>Now most committees in the UN were having a big problem with the Soviet Union
                    because there was always the question of parity. They wanted to have as many of
                    the countries that were favorable to them on different committees. That is why
                    the disarmament committee ended up as a committee of the whole because we just
                    couldn't get agreement on balancing out their friends and our friends. But we
                    finally worked a deal to set up a committee on peaceful uses of outer space, as
                    an ad hoc committee thus avoiding the parity question.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>The UN, of course, is a little like theater, like many things in foreign policy.
                    So we had it arranged that on a certain day in the afternoon, after lunch, the
                    President of the General Assembly would call on the American Ambassador who
                    would get up and say such and such. Then he would call on the Soviet Ambassador
                    who would get up and say such and such. Then everybody would see that the US and
                    the Soviet Union were on agreement about something and that was what the whole
                    UN was predicated on in the first place, and it would go through without any
                    problem.</p>
                <p>So everything was all set. The UN usually convened after lunch about 3 o'clock or
                    so. About 3:30 we were all standing around but Ambassador Lodge wasn't there. So
                    we went up and told the President of the General Assembly that he would be
                    coming shortly. Finally 4:00 came and Henry Cabot Lodge still wasn't there. At
                    this point, Krishna Menon, who was the head of the Indian delegation, got up and
                    screamed and yelled and demanded to be recognized. The President of the Assembly
                    had no alternative and had to recognize him. Krishna got up and just off the top
                    of his head, came up with a huge proposal for the peaceful uses of outer
                    space.</p>
                <p>Well, the Russians decided that we were double crossing them. We didn't know what
                    to do. Finally Henry Cabot Lodge came in. What had happened was that he had
                    overslept. He had gout and had overslept. By the time he got there at 4:30 the
                    whole God damn thing had come apart because the Russians had decided that we
                    were double crossing them. So they then abandoned the committee and for a whole
                    year nothing was done to foster peaceful uses of outer space. Just because our
                    Ambassador had the gout.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression about the United Nations and
                        disarmament and the commitment to use the UN as an instrument, at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: Well, the real problem was that we were already in the Cold War. The
                    United Nations was at least founded on the notion that the US and the USSR would
                    continue to work together as we had during WW II. We were the ones who insisted
                    on the veto, although people keep forgetting that. They always think it was the
                    Soviet Union. We were the ones who wanted it because we thought that without it
                    we couldn't get the UN agreement through our Senate.</p>
                <p>In 1958 because of what was happening in the world, there was no real possibility
                    of the UN being a meaningful factor in disarmament negotiations.</p>
                <p>Later on, we recognized this and the Secretary finally came up with the notion of
                    establishing a Disarmament Commission outside of the UN framework. The Soviet
                    Union agreed to it. We spent one summer negotiating with our allies, England,
                    France, Canada and Italy for an agreement on a public announcement for this
                    commission to start its work. After negotiating two months with our allies, we
                    sent a draft to the Soviet Union. They accepted it within 48 hours. Sometimes
                    your enemies are better than your allies on this kind of thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>But the UN mechanism just was not a good mechanism for fostering many aspects of
                    disarmament. We had to make a lot of compromises. The French decided to test a
                    nuclear bomb in the Sahara. We had been talking in the UN about a ban on such
                    testing. However, the French managed to negotiate us into abstaining on a
                    resolution condemning them for wanting to test in the Sahara. They also
                    persuaded us not only to abstain but also to make a speech that indicated that
                    maybe fallout wasn't such a bad thing. I wrote the speech. It was a good example
                    of verbal prostitution because I met with our atomic energy people and they
                    pointed out that our nuclear bomb tests on Bikini really didn't lead to any
                    permanent damage. Some people died, but there was no permanent damage. What they
                    meant, of course, was that there were no genetic changes as a consequence of our
                    tests. I also learned that one of the main reasons we were testing was a
                    personnel morale problem. If we didn't test the hotshot scientists would go back
                    to their universities. So, to keep them happy, we were testing. Anyway, the
                    speech, that I wrote, is a UN document. What it basically says is, “How do you
                    know, maybe a little bit of strontium 90 is good for you?” The UN was not a good
                    mechanism for meaningful progress on disarmament.</p>
                <p>I think it was misunderstood then what the UN could do. Because of the veto it
                    really could do very little for example in peace maintenance except for the one
                    time when the Soviet Union walked out of the General Assembly and that was in
                    the case of Lebanon. And even that turned out to be of limited value. We had
                    this horse's ass of an Ambassador over there, McClintock, who insisted that
                    there was a real possibility of a Soviet-supported Communist takeover in
                    Lebanon. When the Soviets walked out of the UN meeting we were able to send in
                    the Sixth Fleet under the UN banner. We were all sitting around biting our nails
                    waiting for reports from Lebanon. The first cable that came in from our
                    Ambassador was, “The head of the Sixth Fleet called on me and we discussed the
                    protocol visits that we would make. Then, after he returned to his ship, I went
                    down to the dock and took the Admiral's barge out to return the protocol call.”
                    That was all we got out of McClintock while the whole world was worrying about
                    other things. It soon became clear that there was no real Soviet threat and we
                    finally withdrew.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in 1958.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: That's right. It was basically bad information on the part of the
                    Embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we using the United Nations? I don't think it was a
                        UN operation.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>GRAND: Yes it was. Normally you go through the Security Council where the Soviet
                    Union had a veto. We brought the question up deliberately in the General
                    Assembly where there was no veto possibility, but on the other hand it might not
                    have been possible to get an overwhelming vote. But when the Soviet Union walked
                    out we were able to make it a United Nations operation. Brazil sent troops over
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Brazil sent troops to Lebanon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: Yes. No, that was later on, they had troops in Israel. But we sent in the
                    Sixth Fleet under the guise of the UN because the Soviet Union had walked out of
                    the General Assembly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Henry Cabot Lodge feel about disarmament and all
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: I don't know what his personal feelings were. He would make the point that
                    we were winning in the UN because the Soviet Union was exercising the veto, and
                    that worried a lot of us because we thought the time might come when we would
                    have to use the veto to protect our interests. And the time did come.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were playing this aren't they awful thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: Right. Then, of course, when the Bay of Pigs incident occurred the Soviets
                    had it made. All they had to do was to pick up our speeches and change the
                    country and they are all set.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you leave the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: End of 1958.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: End of 1958. So this is still during the Eisenhower

                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>GRAND: Yes. I went to work for Lyndon Johnson who was then the Majority Leader of
                    the Senate. And given the kind of a President we had then, he was really running
                    the country. One of the things that was happening then, as you may remember, was
                    the famous U2 incident. Since I had been involved in peaceful uses of outer
                    space, I knew something about the technology that was available to us. So I
                    suggested to Johnson that he ought to suggest a crash program to put a spy
                    satellite in outer space and we wouldn't have to worry so much about the U2s
                    getting shot down. He said, “Well, that is a good idea. How can we do that?” I
                    said, “Well, we can get you on 'Meet the Press' and then we can arrange to have
                    a question asked. Then you can come out with this.” Johnson was an amazing guy.
                    He said, “How can you get a question asked?” I said, “Well, Pete Lisagor is an
                    old friend of mine and he is on the panel. I can ask Pete to ask you a question
                    and then you will give him the answer.” He said, “Well, why would Pete do that?”
                    I said, “Because it will give him a good story. Obviously if you want a question
                    asked it is because you have an answer that is going to be news.” Johnson just
                    couldn't believe it was so simple, but that was what we did.</p>
                <p>The question came up and Johnson announced that tomorrow morning he was going to
                    put in a bill calling for a $50 million program for crash development of a spy
                    satellite. And that was the next day's headline. The program did go through and
                    I always thought to myself, “I got that idea in about five minutes. If I thought
                    for about an hour I could probably bankrupt the United States.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing for Johnson?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: I was basically his foreign policy advisor at that point. He had a funny
                    staff. You have to understand the way the Senate works. Johnson was not only the
                    Majority Leader of the Senate, but he was also chairman of any number of
                    committees and subcommittees. So he had a huge staff. Just absolutely huge.
                    However, he also had a small personal staff, you see, and I was part of that. I
                    did all kinds of things. I wrote speeches for him. When the campaign came along
                    in 1960, I went through the political campaign.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was running for President.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: He was running for Vice President.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was running for Vice President at the beginning.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>GRAND: Well, at the beginning he was running for President. He was absolutely
                    persuaded...this is absolutely amazing because Johnson was recognized as a
                    bright political animal...he was persuaded that by sitting in Washington doing
                    his job, the people of the United States would recognize this and his party
                    would give him the nomination. Kennedy and Humphrey were campaigning all over
                    the country for the nomination but he was convinced he was going to get it by
                    just doing his job. Howard Hunt, the oil man, was a source of funds for Johnson,
                    had been for years. One of his guys hung around our office all the time. The
                    West Virginia primaries were coming up. West Virginia is a state where you
                    simply buy votes. You decide how many votes you need and you buy them. That is
                    what Kennedy did and what Humphrey did. Of course Kennedy had more money than
                    Humphrey. People were looking at that primary as kind of a key thing and it
                    turned out to be so because after West Virginia Kennedy got the momentum and
                    went on from there.</p>
                <p>Johnson was not involved in the West Virginia primary. West Virginia, however,
                    did allow for write-in candidates. I went and saw Johnson and said, “Look, I
                    think it could be a key thing, but we could negate it all. You are not running
                    there, so all we need is 50,000 votes in West Virginia or less. Then it wouldn't
                    matter who wins there. If you get that many votes as a write-in you will just
                    negate the importance of this thing.” And I added, “I have already made some
                    informal soundings and we can have little things printed up with your name on
                    them that we can have people stick on the ballot because a lot of those people
                    can't read or write. So many of them might spell your name wrong and that vote
                    would be thrown out. And I have the money from Hunt so we can go ahead and buy
                    the number of votes that we need.” But Johnson said no. He said, “I don't need
                    that. I am going to get the nomination because I am sitting here doing my job. I
                    don't need it.” He was wrong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we get to the campaign and turning to your advising
                        him on foreign affairs, how well informed was he on foreign affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: Not too well informed, but he did have a rule for getting information and
                    he broke his own rule and that is what led to his ultimate defeat when he was
                    President. It was a simple rule. He said, “If you want to know anything about
                    the United States government, you go and speak to the chairman of the Senate
                    committee that handles it, because by the time you get to be chairman of a
                    Senate committee that handles it, you know more about the subject then anybody
                    in the executive branch.” And he was right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that was Fulbright.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>GRAND: Right. And Fulbright and Johnson were very close friends. After the
                    election we went to Paris for the NATO Parliamentarians meeting. There was a
                    plane from the Senator going over and a plane from the House going over. Johnson
                    was then Vice President-elect and allowed that he was not going to spend a night
                    in an airplane with so-and-so who was a Senator whom he hated. He said that if
                    necessary he would fly commercial. Well, what happened was they gave him Air
                    Force One instead. I went over with him. The only other Senator on the plane was
                    Bill Fulbright and his wife. They were intimate friends. Close good friends. And
                    if Johnson had listened to Fulbright on Vietnam, I believe he would have gone
                    down in history as one of our greatest Presidents. Unfortunately, he broke his
                    own rule.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I understood that Johnson was a difficult person to work
                        for. How did you find him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: Well, having been in the executive branch for a long time, it was hard to
                    understand that a Senator of the United States is in fact an independent
                    government who also happens to be a human being. I didn't understand this at
                    first. I got involved, after being there a short time, in what I later
                    discovered everybody gets involved in, which is an argument with Johnson over
                    something.</p>
                <p>The arguments with Johnson never were just, “I happen to disagree with you.” They
                    got to be very nasty. Finally Johnson said to me, “You son-of-a-bitch, you're
                    fired.” I said, “You can have this God damn job, I quit.” And that was that.
                    Well about a week went by and I was in my apartment when the phone rang. It was
                    Johnson on the phone who said, “Stan are you all right?” I said, “Yes, I'm
                    fine.” “Have you been sick?” “No.” “Well, what has happened? I understand you
                    haven't been in the office for about a week?” I said, “Well, you fired me.” “Oh,
                    the Hell with that. Look Stan we have this problem...”</p>
                <p>Thus I discovered that what happened was that when Johnson got mad at somebody he
                    fired them. But all it meant was that he wouldn't speak to you for a couple of
                    days. Because in the Senate the way you get hired is that the Senator signs a
                    piece of paper to the Sergeant-at-Arms giving your name and the amount of salary
                    you are to get paid. And, until he fires you...by signing another order to the
                    Sergeant-at-Arms...you just keep getting paid. As a matter of fact, if he dies
                    you get paid three months after his death. So when Johnson “fires” you all it
                    had meant was that for a period of time he wouldn't talk to you. That was it. It
                    didn't bother me once I understood that.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>As for being difficult to work for, I remember at the beginning of the campaign
                    he was going up to Hartford and after Hartford he was scheduled to go to New
                    York and make a speech. George Reedy had written one of those you know mother's
                    milk speeches that he wrote so well. I had argued that New York should really be
                    a foreign policy speech because that was an area where he had not said anything
                    before. We rode out to the airport together and I argued with him about it and
                    he said, “No. I have George's speech and that is what I'll use.” That was fine
                    except that at 2 o'clock that morning my phone rang and he said, “You know, you
                    are right. The New York speech has got to be foreign policy. Mary Margaret is
                    here and I am going to put her on the phone and you dictate the speech.” I was
                    hardly awake but alert enough to say, “I tell you what. I really need some
                    information from the Library of Congress so what I'd like to do is get the
                    information in the morning and take a plane and meet you in New York.” “Well,
                    all right, okay.” I don't think it ever would have occurred to anybody except
                    Johnson to call you at 2 o'clock in the morning and say dictate a speech and
                    think this was a normal way of doing things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any areas in foreign policy that he was
                        particularly interested in or that he really never quite grasped?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: I don't think he ever really focused on the foreign affairs field until
                    after he became President and by that time I was no longer working for him. But
                    I think that all of his career was basically concerned with domestic politics.
                    And I think he was a captive of Texas oil interests and other interests in
                    Texas. Until he moved into the Vice President position, I think he had never
                    really focused on international relations very much.</p>
                <p>He was really a terrible human being because one day he would be cursing you and
                    the next day he would be hugging and practically kissing you. He could be warm.
                    He was exceedingly smart and sharp. For example, when we got to Paris he had an
                    interview set up with de Gaulle and the Embassy was very concerned about
                    this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was while he was...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: He was Vice President-elect, before the inauguration but after the
                    election. The Embassy was prepared to provide him with an excellent interpreter.
                    I said, “You aren't over here to negotiate anything. You are here to meet de
                    Gaulle and find out what kind of guy he is and maybe give your impressions to
                    Kennedy when you get back.” I said, “Why don't we tell the Embassy that we don't
                    need an interpreter and let the French provide one.” I said, “I think this will
                    flatter de Gaulle and I'm sure you'll get the best interpreter that they have.
                    What have you got to lose? You are not going to negotiate anything. You
                    immediately start off giving him what he thinks is an advantage, he will feel
                    great about it.” And Johnson agreed.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>The Embassy didn't like it one damn bit and to calm things down he agreed to let
                    somebody from the Embassy sit in on the meeting. The meeting was scheduled to
                    last half a hour. It lasted two hours. They hit it off very well, just because,
                    I think, (although maybe it is my own ego on this) but I think because we
                    started off letting them think they had the advantage. I think that is sometimes
                    an advantage in international relations. Let your opposition think they are
                    ahead of you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression about the dynamics? Here were two
                        big tall men with big noses, tremendous egos, Johnson and de Gaulle...with
                        Johnson not knowing much about that particular subject and de Gaulle having
                        an antipathy towards America. You were at that meeting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: I was not at that meeting, no. The Embassy sent somebody. But Johnson
                    reported back enthusiastically that de Gaulle and he were professional
                    politicians and both knew how to handle their encounter. They hit it off just
                    tremendously well. As I said the meeting was supposed to be a half hour and it
                    lasted a couple of hours. A couple of pros doing their thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in the campaign when he was running
                        for Vice President?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: Yes, I worked in the Vice Presidential campaign. I did some advance work.
                    Wrote some speeches for him. As a matter of fact I wrote a marvelous speech for
                    him which nobody ever paid any attention to because the same day I wrote my
                    speech which he delivered in Tampa, Florida, Jack Kennedy made a speech in
                    Miami, Florida to the AFL-CIO announcing the Alliance for Progress. My speech
                    was also on Latin America. What it said was...again I had moved out of the
                    picture by then, unfortunately...my speech was that what we should do with
                    Panama was to set up a Port Authority type operation and let all the countries
                    of Latin America be members of the Port Authority and use the profits from
                    Panama Canal operations to set up an Inter-American university. My argument to
                    Johnson was, “Look, the reason that Panama becomes a big issue every so often is
                    because everybody in Latin America likes to have an opportunity to kick the
                    United States from time to time. So they back Panama. But if you appeal to their
                    greed and give them a piece of the action, nobody is going to back Panama.” He
                    forgot about the speech when Panama blew up in his face.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you running into collisions with the Kennedy group?
                        This was a very aggressive bunch of politicians who took no quarter.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>GRAND: I didn't have any problem with the Kennedy group. Johnson was fascinated
                    by them. He just thought they were smart and classy people, whereas he thought
                    most of his own people were dumb. I didn't have any problem with the Kennedy
                    people. The only time I ever had any problem with the Kennedy people was later
                    on after the election and after we were in office. I was then in AID and at one
                    point I got a call from Walter Jenkins who suggested that when I had a few
                    minutes I might want to come up to the Hill to see him. And knowing Walter very
                    well, I was up at the Hill within the next half hour because Walter wouldn't
                    have called unless something important was happening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was chief of staff to Johnson?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: Yes. He said, “I just want you to know that I was approached by one of
                    Bobby Kennedy's people who said that he wanted to know how Johnson would react
                    if you were thrown out.” And he went on to say, “I understand that Bobby Kennedy
                    is trying to get most of the Johnson people thrown out of office.” He said, “I
                    told Bobby Kennedy's man that if you were removed, Johnson would probably go to
                    the President about it.” He said, “I don't think you have anything to worry
                    about.” And I didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What instigated this? Do you know?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: The story I heard from Walter was that apparently Bobby Kennedy was trying
                    to get rid of the Johnson people. This was when Jack Kennedy was still alive, of
                    course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Johnson Vice President at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: Yes. He was Vice President.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After the election of 1960 and the Kennedy-Johnson ticket
                        won, what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: I went back then into the executive branch. I went back into what was then
                    the DLF (Development Loan Fund) and was involved in the creation of what became
                    AID (Agency for International Development). AID was created by combining the DLF
                    with the old ICA (International Cooperation Administration) which was basically
                    a technical assistance operation. The DLF was a lending operation to
                    underdeveloped countries. Legislation combined them into what became AID.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>I then took over what was then the lending function for Latin America under what
                    became the Alliance for Progress. I did that for a certain period of time. I set
                    up, in effect, the lending operation under the Alliance.</p>
                <p>We did some amusing things, and I think this may be instructive for people coming
                    along. No matter how high sounding your objectives might be, you always face
                    political realities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just thinking that we might stop here and pick up
                        later on.</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is July 10, 1992 and this is the second interview
                        with Stanley Grand.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: This is probably useful in indicating how you get things done under the
                    AID program. This was right at the beginning of the Alliance for Progress.
                    Kennedy had decided to visit Mexico City and we had been working on a loan which
                    was designed to transfer land to Mexican peasants. It was a complicated loan and
                    required a lot of input on the part of the Mexican government in terms of legal
                    changes, etc. It was a loan that was taking and would take a long time to
                    develop. When Kennedy announced his trip down there we decided that since the
                    Alliance was the big thing in terms of a lending program that was going to
                    accomplish important social changes, it would be a nice thing if he could have a
                    loan signing ceremony. This loan was the only thing in sight.</p>
                <p>I went down there with a lawyer, who later became the Under Secretary for
                    Economic Affairs at the State Department, and decided that what we would do was
                    sign the loan, create a loan agreement. But in order to meet our legislative
                    requirements, which require that you have a feasible object in hand before you
                    could possibly sign a loan agreement, we put into the implementation of the loan
                    all of the work that should have been done before the loan was signed. So after
                    the loan was signed with a great deal of fanfare in Mexico City, we then sent to
                    the Mexican government what they expected namely the first implementation letter
                    which contained all of the conditions precedent to the disbursement of the
                    loan.</p>
                <p>Now all of these conditions were the requirements that should have been met
                    before even signing the loan, but that was the way of getting around the legal
                    restraints. The Mexicans knew this was going to happen and we knew it was going
                    to happen. But there were some people in the White House who simply didn't
                    really understand what we had done.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>Two or three months later, Dick Goodwin, who was in the White House and handling
                    the Alliance, a job he deserved since he was the one who first coined this
                    phrase, called and wanted to know when we were going to make some money
                    available under this loan. I said, “Probably not for a year or two.” He screamed
                    and yelled, “This is bureaucracy.” I said, “Dick, you have to understand what
                    happened here. This loan could not be made legally until certain things have
                    been accomplished in Mexico. It sometimes takes a long time for us to do things
                    and even longer for the Mexicans to do things especially if you're trying to
                    make some radical changes. Normally what you would do is wait until these
                    conditions have been met and then you make the loan. But what we did here, since
                    we wanted to have a loan for the President to sign, is to put all these
                    conditions in the loan as conditions precedent to disbursement. When they are
                    met then we will begin to disperse. I don't expect a nickel of this is going to
                    be disbursed for at least a year to two. It was a politically timed loan so that
                    the President could do something spectacular during his visit.” I think Dick
                    Goodwin would get furious if you ever called him naive, but in this case he
                    certainly was.</p>
                <p>In other words there were often times when the lending business had political
                    objectives. The whole Alliance was not only a US domestic political show, which
                    Kennedy enjoyed, it was also a Latin American political show. I think there was
                    little doubt in the mind of those connected with the Alliance that had it not
                    been for Castro, we probably would not have had an Alliance for Progress. We
                    ultimately, perhaps, would have developed some kind of economic development
                    program with Latin America, but in terms of US support for a concerted effort in
                    Latin America, this resulted from Castro.</p>
                <p>And I don't think many countries in Latin America thought otherwise. Most
                    countries in Latin America did not think of us as being a magnanimous country.
                    They thought, and perhaps rightly, I think, that we were reacting to Castro and
                    what he was doing in Latin America. I think in terms of the lending operation
                    for the Alliance, we started out with an announcement of a huge program, the
                    main part of which was different from our former foreign aid operations anywhere
                    else in the world.</p>
                <p>If you look at Europe, if you look at the ICA operation, or the Point Four
                    operation, they were basically grant operations. We gave people money and that
                    was that. We controlled it and developed projects, but the money was gone. In
                    the light of Europe's later development, we probably should have made loans
                    instead of grants.</p>
                <p>Under the Alliance the main source of funding was lending. This created a lot of
                    problems. One, most of the personnel that you had to work with in the Alliance
                    in the State Department and the AID agency, were grant-oriented. There were not
                    many development lending people around except for the World Bank. The IDB was
                    just getting started, they didn't have any people. So the problem was one of
                    training people to become development lenders.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>Development lending is very different from other kinds of lending...commercial
                    lending, institutional lending, etc. If you are making a commercial loan, your
                    main concern is getting your money back. In development lending, however, your
                    main concern is accomplishing an economic objective with social implications,
                    and you hope to get your money back because that is one of the things that the
                    law requires you to look for...getting your money back. But your main objective
                    is the accomplishment of an economic and social objective. That is what you are
                    in business for. There just weren't many people around who had had this kind of
                    experience.</p>
                <p>We found we would have to train people to do this kind of lending and that was
                    the big challenge we had as the program got started. It resulted in the program
                    not being able to fly immediately.</p>
                <p>The second thing that made it very difficult to get the Alliance program going
                    was the fact that we didn't have places to put our money into. We didn't have
                    viable projects that we could lend money for. We talked in terms of putting in
                    substantial amounts of money every year and there was just no place for it to go
                    because we didn't have projects that would meet basic criteria in terms of our
                    legislation and program objectives.</p>
                <p>As a consequence of that, perhaps the only really significant contribution that I
                    have made to international development lending, since it was later picked up by
                    the World Bank and IDB, was the creation of what came to be known as the
                    feasibility loan. This was a loan made to countries to hire consultants who
                    would create a project which we could then lend money to.</p>
                <p>The first of such loans was made to Bolivia. Bolivia was a high priority country
                    in terms of our lending operations but we discovered that there were no fundable
                    projects in the country. Our Ambassador came up and was quite upset by this. So
                    I developed the feasibility loan. When we had the loan ready to go in about
                    three or four months, the Minister of Public Works of Bolivia, came up and in
                    the Alliance spirit there was a great deal of concern that everything be handled
                    in a very honest fashion, etc. We signed the loan and the first step would have
                    to be the hiring of a consulting company that would be able to work on specific
                    projects and come up with feasibility studies which would then be the basis for
                    loans.</p>
                <p>He asked me to give him a name of a consulting company that he could use. I said,
                    “Well, there are any number of them that you can use.” I mentioned several
                    well-known companies and said, “You decide, it is your money and up to you.” And
                    he said, “Well, which one would you choose?” I said, “I don't know.” “Well,
                    which are the two most prominent ones?” I gave him the names of the two most
                    prominent and said, “Just take your choice.” He said, “How can I decide that?” I
                    said, “Why don't you toss a coin?” He said, “Why don't you toss the coin?” And I
                    said, “No. I won't toss but I will give you a quarter.”</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>And so on the basis of a quarter of mine, one of the large consulting engineering
                    companies got themselves a multi-million dollar contract. And it did result in a
                    number of projects, all of which were funded.</p>
                <p>That procedure then, feasibility loan lending, was later used all over Latin
                    America to develop projects.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well looking at this Stan, in the time you were there
                        dealing with this business...1961-66...where did you find the particularly
                        problem areas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: Well, first of all, philosophically I think, we had our biggest problem,
                    because we are a “can do” country. When we have a problem, we like to solve it.
                    That is why you have a lot of criticism in later years...books were written too
                    close to the time...that the Alliance didn't accomplish its objectives. If you
                    look at it now, many years later, you say yes, it did accomplish its
                    objectives.One of the problems that you had with the Alliance was that you were
                    trying to bring about very profound institutional changes in Latin America and
                    you don't bring about that kind of change in a year or two. You do this kind of
                    slowly. I am persuaded that foreign assistance, bilateral or multilateral, may
                    have a catalytic action, but it is not the prime factor. You have to somehow or
                    other get countries to begin to be willing to make changes themselves.
                    Otherwise, all you can do is watch them not make changes. And all you could do
                    with an Alliance type operation was to create a public focus on countries and
                    give them a certain amount of incentive in the form of money...in our case
                    through the AID program, the Ex-Im Bank, the World Bank and IDB...to help them
                    move along.</p>
                <p>We were facing and are facing still in Latin America the substantial
                    non-existence of a middle class, which means you have very rich and almost
                    inconceivable urban and rural poverty. These are still a factor. They are not as
                    much a factor in 1992 as they were in 1962, but they still exist. That mitigates
                    against your being able to bring about the kind of changes that you want.</p>
                <p>Now we have succeeded, and I think the Alliance may be responsible for this to
                    some extent, in bringing about a tremendous change in the nature of governments
                    in Latin America. At that time most of the governments were military controlled
                    or in the process of being taken over by the military. At the present time most
                    of the governments are democratically elected. Now when we say democratically, I
                    don't have any childish illusions that these people have the same kind of
                    democratic notions that are an inherent part of the American phenomena. It is a
                    different kind of thing. But at least you do not have the constant military
                    takeovers. I think thirty years later you are accomplishing the institutional
                    changes that we tried to bring about under the Alliance.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>What were the main problems that we faced? Governments that were incapable of
                    carrying out many of these projects. We had the problem of training people. We
                    had just the inability of some governments to function. Let me give you an
                    example. Finally in the early '60s, the last of the Trujillo gang were thrown
                    out of the Dominican Republic and a new democratic junta took over. We went down
                    there and made them a psychologically important $25 million loan, which was
                    basically a balance of payments loan. It was not a development loan. It was
                    designed to have immediate and favorable political impact. The question then was
                    implementing this loan. We have a lot of provisions in the legislation which
                    require countries to do all kinds of strange things to get our money, even a
                    balance of payments loan.</p>
                <p>I went down there and met with the Minister of Finance with the implementation
                    papers which contained the conditions precedent to disbursement, which in this
                    case were really quite simple since it was not a project oriented loan. I spent
                    a whole morning talking to him about these things. I would say to him that we
                    needed such and such and he could accomplish this in several different ways
                    which I outlined. He was to decide. On this provision you could do this or the
                    other. You decide.</p>
                <p>I went back to my hotel and sat around and had the feeling that I wasn't getting
                    anywhere with this man. Something wasn't penetrating. I finally figured out what
                    it was. The next morning I met with him again and said, “Let's go over these
                    letters again. On such and such, let's say marine insurance, you can do such and
                    such or such and such. Our recommendation is that you do such and such.” “But of
                    course,” says he, “that is the way we will do it.” I went through the whole
                    thing and I realized that what you were dealing with was a very nice human being
                    who had no idea of how to do any of these things and wasn't really able to make
                    decisions. All I had to do was just to suggest to him which was the better of
                    two alternatives.</p>
                <p>I think that is part of the problem you had in implementing the Alliance. The
                    lack of in-country capabilities. Our own Congress put some pretty sophisticated
                    albeit often innocuous requirements in our lending procedures that were in many
                    cases very difficult to explain to countries. I know that one of the big
                    problems you can have...things that took time...after you negotiated a loan and
                    then met with the people who were to implement the loan. You sometimes had to
                    explain in considerable detail the nature of some of what I called the idiocy we
                    put into these loan agreements. Why they were there, the US Congressional
                    implications. Often, in fact they really didn't have much importance as far as
                    the country you were dealing with was concerned, but they were there because of
                    some US domestic interest in the loan. Those were the famous so-called
                    barnacles. Right now I agree with a committee that was set up recently and
                    reported that perhaps the best thing you can do with the US bilateral aid
                    program is to just abandon it for maybe a year because you have so many
                    barnacles on the legislation that you have a very unworkable operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there an effort to try through exchange programs to
                        develop sophisticated economists or people who could deal with the problems
                        of loans and everything else that goes along with an economy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: Yes, that was an integral part of the Alliance and that was the
                    combination of the lending program with the grant program. The grant program
                    provided funds for exactly the sort of thing you mentioned, namely, the exchange
                    of persons for training in the United States. We used all sorts of facilities
                    including universities. We used to get people Master and Doctoral degrees in the
                    field of agriculture, etc. which was fundamental to the development of these
                    countries.</p>
                <p>I might add as an aside that I am not particularly enamored with the use of
                    universities in the United States on a carte blanche basis. You have to realize
                    that the Land Grant College and University Association is a very strong lobbying
                    group here in the United States. They were able to get some very lucrative
                    contracts from the AID agency to train people.</p>
                <p>One university, Texas A&amp;M, had a team operating in Latin America. When I got
                    to Argentina to run the mission I met with the head of the Texas A&amp;M team, a
                    very nice guy. I told him that while I had been in Texas I had never been to
                    Texas A&amp;M and wondered what kind of campus they had. It was a friendly
                    conversation. He said, “I don't know.” I said, “What do you mean you don't
                    know?” He said, “Well, I have never been there.” I said, “But you are heading up
                    a Texas A&amp;M team here and you are sending students up there to get advanced
                    degrees. And you are having some of them work with Texas A&amp;M people who are
                    down here in Argentina working with you and you have never been to Texas
                    A&amp;M?” And he said, “No.” I said, “Well, how did you get this job?” He said,
                    “Well, I was working at the University of Utah and got a call from the Texas
                    A&amp;M people and they offered me the job. They said I had to get down there
                    right away so I came right down here to Argentina.” I said to him, “Well, next
                    week you are going to go up to Texas A&amp;M and at least look at the place so
                    that you can say you know what it looks like.” And he did.</p>
                <p>The land grant colleges at the beginning of the Alliance did not have enough
                    people, particularly project manager types. They got contracts from AID but they
                    didn't have on staff people to implement those contracts. So they just hired
                    people. We probably would have done just as well or maybe more economically
                    hiring a regular head-hunting company, who do the same thing. They just go out
                    and hire consultants. So I am not persuaded that in the future government
                    organizations should give carte blanche to universities just because they are
                    universities.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>But we did a lot of that sort of thing, training. I will give you a specific
                    project. We decided that one of the big problems in Argentina was a need to
                    improve their Customs Service because there was a lot of smuggling going on in
                    and out of the country. One of the things they needed was a lab. Now a Customs
                    laboratory is a very sophisticated setup. So we first sent some people up here
                    to the United States from the Argentine Customs Service, trained them, etc.
                    using grant funds. Then, when they were back in place, we built the lab using
                    loan funds. It is still functioning well.</p>
                <p>But I think part of the problem was, as you pointed out, a lack of trained
                    personnel to implement these loans. It is easy to get people to build a road.
                    Every country has road building operations. But when you talk about more
                    sophisticated things that will have an institutional change, you need different
                    kinds of people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You moved down to Argentina from 1966-68. What caused that
                        and what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: I ran the AID Mission there, which was the natural thing to do. You have
                    to get out of Washington eventually. I was actually there until 1970. I left
                    Argentina in 1970. I went down there initially as the assistant Mission director
                    handling the lending operation. Then I became the Mission director. We were in
                    the process of ultimately phasing out the program in Argentina. We felt that
                    Argentina had graduated and didn't need to be part of the Alliance operation
                    then. We were wrong, but we had done a lot of institutional building programs in
                    Argentina. And Argentina was a different kind of place than the rest of Latin
                    America.</p>
                <p>Argentina was probably the only country at that time in Latin America that had a
                    real middle class. It is still the only Latin American country that has a middle
                    class as a majority. Mexico had a middle class which was somewhat different. I
                    think the main difference being that Argentina was and is the country with the
                    highest literacy rate in Latin America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It really is an European country isn't it? I mean there is
                        not much of an indigenous Indian population is there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: It is mainly Italian and Spanish. The Argentines did to the Indians
                    exactly the same as we did. They either killed them off or put them on
                    reservations. They still have reservations. The only Argentine twist on this is
                    that in the front lines of their troops when they were fighting the Indians they
                    put the few blacks that they had. That and chicken pox in the port area killed
                    off all the blacks. You don't have many blacks in Argentina. If you see a black
                    in Argentina he is probably from Brazil. It is basically a Spanish and Italian
                    country with a small amount of English and German input.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>Very fortunate things happened in Argentine history. A man was elected President
                    in Argentina by the name of Sarmiento, who was elected President while he was in
                    the United States working with Horace Mann. Horace Mann is the person who set up
                    our public education system. Sarmiento went back and set up a similar public
                    education system in Argentina. It is unique in Latin America. There are many
                    other ways in which Argentina is very different from the rest of Latin America.
                    And its problems as a consequence are quite different.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got down there, who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: I had three different ambassadors. One was Ed Martin, who is a brilliant
                    man. This is an example of what you are dealing with. Ed Martin was in his early
                    '50s when he was assigned as Ambassador to Argentina. He didn't speak Spanish,
                    although he had been Assistant Secretary for Latin America for a short time. He
                    went to the Foreign Service Institute for three months before going down to
                    Argentina. When he got down there he could communicate in Spanish, and could and
                    did read everything...just an amazing guy. An absolutely top flight human being.
                    One of the really outstanding career ambassadors that the Foreign Service
                    has.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was an economist, wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: Yes. And he knows how to run an embassy. I remember right after I got down
                    there we had a revolution. In the morning staff meeting about a week or two
                    afterwards, Ed said to me, “Stan, what do you think of so-and-so who is the new
                    Secretary of Housing?” I said, “Well, I don't know him.” In kind of an abrupt
                    fashion he said, “Well, it seems to me you certainly ought to know the person
                    you are going to be working with.” I went down to my office and pulled out the
                    newspaper where he said it was printed. Actually it was the secretary for some
                    kind of a social organization that had been named. So I wrote him an memorandum
                    saying, “Mr. Ambassador, I don't know so-and-so whom you mentioned and who is
                    going to be Secretary in the Ministry of Public Welfare. It is my understanding
                    that so-and-so, who is a friend of mine, will be named shortly as Secretary of
                    Housing.” Before the next staff meeting this man was actually named Secretary of
                    Housing. Ed, to his everlasting glory, in his next staff meeting apologized to
                    me publicly to all the members of the country team saying that he had made a
                    mistake. I thought that was marvelous. A top flight guy.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>He was followed in turn by a rather strange man, Carter Burgess who was a
                    political appointee. He had been President of TWA, American Machinery and
                    Foundry and was a big financial supporter of Lyndon Johnson. A very interesting
                    person. He succeeded in dividing the Embassy very quickly into groups. A
                    majority group who hated his guts and a very small group of us who were his
                    favorites. The favorites at the Embassy then were myself, Len Saccio the DCM,
                    and Herb Thompson, both of whom went on to be ambassadors. We had a very
                    pleasant time as a consequence. Carter Burgess felt that he didn't know anything
                    about international relations, but he knew how to handle people, and he did. He
                    gave marvelous parties and spent a lot of his own money. But those parties were
                    working parties and he saw to it that people in the Embassy worked. A lot of
                    people didn't like that. A lot of embassy people used to go to Embassy cocktail
                    parties and stand around looking pleasant. Carter didn't let that happen. He
                    made people work. He was a very tough guy. I liked him. He lasted a short period
                    of time because of an error that was made by Nixon's transition team and he left
                    there when Nixon came in.</p>
                <p>In due time he was replaced by John Davis Lodge. John Davis Lodge is a person
                    with a tremendous career. He had been a Congressman. He had been Governor of the
                    State of Connecticut. He had been Ambassador to Spain and was finally named
                    Ambassador to Argentina.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was also a movie actor. I saw him with Marlene Dietrich
                        in the “Scarlet Pimpernel” just a couple of nights ago.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: I think he was also in “The Good Ship Lollipop” with Shirley Temple.</p>
                <p>He was also interesting. He and his wife, Franchesca, were a strange pair. I got
                    along exceeding well with him. He was probably one of the best, if not the best,
                    early 20th century ambassadors. This was a man who was made for minuets and
                    things of that kind. It was not his fault that he was living in the late 20th
                    century. I don't think he should be castigated for this. He had a lovely social
                    style. He didn't have the slightest idea of what was going on in Argentina
                    besides the social scene, and he really didn't care. I was a bachelor at that
                    point and as a consequence I moved around in high society Argentine circles and
                    was well aware of what was going on in terms of society gossip. Invariably when
                    I would go up to talk to him about something, we would end up discussing who was
                    sleeping with whom, etc.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>But I had his complete support. I remember I was going up for an annual country
                    review of my program in Argentina. I went up to see him about this and we talked
                    about the program a little bit and then got onto the usual gossip. Then at the
                    next country team meeting, a day or two before I was going to leave, he
                    announced that, “Stan is going up to Washington with his Argentine program. It
                    is a top notch program and has my complete support.” He hadn't the slightest
                    idea what I was doing. But on the other hand, and I think this is something that
                    people might want to keep in mind, when he was a Congressman he became a very
                    close friend of Richard Nixon and he said to me at one point, “Stan, if you have
                    any real problems up there, give me a call and I will call the President.” And
                    he was the kind of guy who would do just that.</p>
                <p>When I got to Washington and had problems with my bureaucratic equals in
                    Washington on some aspects of my program, if it was something that I really
                    wanted, I would just say, “Well, you know the Ambassador feels very strongly
                    about this and you all know how erratic this Ambassador is. He told me that if I
                    had any trouble, to give him a call and he would call the President.” And of
                    course the whole bureaucracy was terrorized and I got what I wanted. He was very
                    useful.</p>
                <p>I got along with him all right because, as he pointed out to me early on, “Stan,
                    I know you are a Democrat but on the other hand you worked for Lyndon Johnson
                    and Lyndon Johnson was a good friend of my brother [he was, he appointed him as
                    Ambassador to Vietnam] so you are a good guy.” I had a wonderful time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me, on the AID program you said that you were there
                        to phase it down because you felt things had moved along, but yet that was a
                        mistake. What was the reason for that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: Well, we decided to phase out Argentina at that point because we felt that
                    it had gone along economically and was advancing socially as much as we could
                    assist with bilateral aid. Argentina was eligible for lending from the IDB and
                    the World Bank, through its normal window rather than through IDA, which is its
                    soft loan window. We felt that it was a country in which there wasn't really
                    much more we could hope to accomplish. It was under a military government. It
                    was not going to be moving out of this as far as we could see for a long time.
                    It just seemed that with our own funds being reduced and needs elsewhere in the
                    world, this was one country that could make it on its own. As a matter of fact,
                    Argentina was feeling its economic oats to the point that it announced it would
                    become a donor nation of its own through the IDB.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>So we felt that we could move out of there without any real problem. And we did.
                    I think I said it was a mistake. I don't know whether it was a mistake or not.
                    The kind of fundamental change which Argentina has gone through in the last
                    three or four years, which is bringing about tremendous economic advance, is the
                    kind of change that could only have been accomplished as a consequence of a kind
                    of weird internal development. That is fine. In other words, what I am saying is
                    that Argentina, until the last four or five years, has been suffering as a
                    consequence of Peron and all that Peron did in terms of the taking over of
                    industry and nationalization of things, etc. He has been replaced by a so-called
                    Peronista who in the last four or five years has reversed everything Peron had
                    done under the same banner. I am sure that whenever the President now opens his
                    mouth Peron turns in his grave. But we could not have done very much more to
                    improve Argentina economically at the time we phased out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political situation when you were
                        there—1966-70?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: You had a military government that had taken over. However, most of the
                    people in the government at the Cabinet level were not military people.</p>
                <p>This reminds me of another example of how you get things done. People think that
                    when you are working government to government it is an easy thing. When you get
                    a military government into Latin America they are very strongly Catholic. All of
                    a sudden crucifixes reappear in government offices. In most countries, with the
                    exception of Mexico, Catholicism is the official religion of the country. When
                    you have civilian governments that is sort of down played.</p>
                <p>We had had in Argentina a planned parenthood program, a birth control program. It
                    operated very well two levels below the ministerial level. Everybody including
                    the minister knew it was going on. We were providing materials from the planned
                    parenthood operation out of London, which is the place which AID used to buy its
                    materials before the program was curtailed in recent years here. We would
                    distribute loops, intrauterine devices, pills and things of this nature. The way
                    we did it in Argentina was sort of amusing. We obviously could not, with a
                    government that was officially opposed to this sort of operation although
                    backing it fully, bring it in and get this stuff through customs as the US
                    government. So what we did was have it all shipped from London via the
                    diplomatic pouch to me. Then we just distributed it.</p>
                <p>Everybody knew what was going on and there wasn't any problem until one time we
                    almost had a disaster. We got a cable from London which stated that they were
                    going to send, on such and such a ship, thousands of intrauterine devices, pills
                    and condoms all shipped to me. When things are shipped to you and you are in the
                    diplomatic service, as you know, the Ambassador sends a Note to the Foreign
                    Office certifying that whatever it is that is coming in is for your personal
                    use. Well, I was a bachelor at that point. I called London and got the thing
                    stopped and then went up to tell Carter Burgess. He almost fell on the floor
                    laughing. He said, “My God, you should have let this happen. We would be giving
                    this country an inferiority complex.”</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me, Stan, this will straddle your time in Washington
                        and part of your time in Argentina, one of the things that has been said is
                        that when Kennedy died the Alliance for Progress died. That Johnson had no
                        particular interest. From your perspective and having known Johnson and
                        worked with him and the people around him, how do you feel about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: One of the first things that Johnson did shortly after the Kennedy
                    funeral...it was a very moving thing as I happened to be invited there...was to
                    call a meeting for all the Ambassadors from Latin America to the White House, it
                    was the first big meeting that he had, and its purpose was to reassure them that
                    the Alliance would continue. Mrs. Kennedy showed up for the meeting. It was
                    unexpected. It was a very moving experience for all the Ambassadors.</p>
                <p>Now Kennedy and his people operated on a very activist level. In other words,
                    Kennedy was not adverse to picking up the phone and calling a State Department
                    desk officer. Half of them almost died of a heart attack when that happened to
                    them, because you don't really expect to be called by the President of the
                    United States.</p>
                <p>Johnson had a different approach. He was interested in the Alliance. As a young
                    man he had hitch-hiked through Mexico, etc. He had the kind of Texas
                    paternalistic view about Latin America...they are all our boys. He was content,
                    in terms of the Alliance and a lot of other things, to give the support to
                    something, get the people in whom he thought would do it and then let it go.</p>
                <p>He made several trips to Latin America and he came across in a different way.
                    Interesting things happened on his trips to Latin America. I was not on those
                    trips with him because I had already moved out. But the Latins reacted to him in
                    a strange way. They had loved Kennedy. And they were sort of, you know, here
                    comes this long gangling, not very handsome Texan, who doesn't have any of the
                    charm and charisma of a Kennedy. But after a while they suddenly found when
                    talking to this man that he was really interested in them. Johnson had the
                    ability, you know, to listen as well as to talk...when he wanted to. Very often
                    he would drive people crazy because he wouldn't listen to people. But he was
                    interested in Latin America and backed it, used his prestige and ability to
                    manipulate Congress, or to control Congress, to keep the Alliance program going
                    and funded well.</p>
                <p>We didn't have any of the flashiness, but the program went on very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you experience much White House staff interference
                        when Johnson was there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>GRAND: Practically nothing as compared to the time when Kennedy was there. But
                    then again, you know, Kennedy had bright guys that had ideas and they had just
                    taken over. A lot of them were gone when Johnson took over, although Johnson did
                    keep an awful lot of the Kennedy people. He was fascinated by the Kennedy
                    people. He thought they were real bright, and I think that was one of his errors
                    that ultimately led to his down fall. Because he listened to people like
                    McNamara. There was, however, very little interference from the White House as
                    concerned the Alliance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Argentina you had these various ambassadors. How
                        comfortable were we with them. Was there any feeling that we should do
                        something about the military government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: We had passed through that phase. When the Alliance first started one of
                    the first governments to be taken over by the military was Peru. We had an
                    ambassador there by the name of Loeb who owned a newspaper in New Hampshire. He
                    was a liberal appointed by Kennedy. When the military government took over in
                    Peru the Kennedy reaction was...freeze the AID program, get the ambassador out
                    of there and bring him home. Which is what we did. By the time the late '60s
                    came around, most of the governments of Latin America were military governments.
                    There was no real problem with them, as a matter of fact, in working with them
                    and accomplishing many of the Alliance's objectives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there problems in Argentina when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: We didn't have any substantial human rights problems in Argentina at that
                    time. We had some problems in terms of US-Argentine relations as a consequence
                    of the fact that there was, there still is, a substantial amount of
                    anti-Semitism in Argentina. Argentina has the second largest urban Jewish
                    population outside of the United States. In other words, as I recall the order
                    of Jewish populations in cities is New York, the largest, Argentina the second
                    largest and Tel Aviv the third largest.</p>

                <p>GRAND: “Fiddler On The Roof” in the United States ends with everybody leaving the
                    Soviet Union and going to the United States. “Fiddler On The Roof” in Argentina
                    ends with everybody leaving Russia and going to Argentina. And that is what
                    happened simultaneously. At that particular time in the late 19th century, Jews
                    leaving Russia went to two places. They went to the United States or to
                    Argentina. They settled there in the Mesopotamia area. They set up kibbutz the
                    same as they do now in Israel. So you had that large migration of pre-World War
                    I Russian Jews. Then you had the pre-World War II influx of German Jews, just as
                    we did in the United States. That is where you get basically the same pattern of
                    immigration as we had here in the United States.</p>
                <p>There was and still is latent and sometimes active anti-Semitism. It was, I
                    think, to some extent exaggerated when I was there by the New York Times. But
                    you know, if I were the New York Times representative in Argentina, what kind of
                    stories would I report to the New York Times? I would report anti-Semitic ones,
                    they sell well in New York. I think the New York Times correspondent, in all
                    fairness, did do an unfair job of emphasizing the anti-Semitism in
                    Argentina.</p>
                <p>But, we didn't have any of the problems that developed later on in Chile, for
                    example.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you left in 1970 and came back to Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: I came back to Washington and took over the direction of the technical
                    assistance program for Latin America. I did that for three years and then I
                    retired and went back to live in Argentina. I had married an Argentine lady and
                    decided I wanted to go back there. I went back and got involved in international
                    banking with a large family conglomerate that owns banks, ranches, textiles,
                    wineries and all kinds of operations. I was involved in the banking operation.
                    They have banks in the Bahamas and in Uruguay as well as their main bank in
                    Argentina. I ended up being president of one of the banks and vice president of
                    a couple of others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to end on the government side, the time you were
                        doing technical assistance...1970-73...what were your particular areas of
                        concentration?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>GRAND: When I first came back I was appointed as special assistant to the person
                    who was running the Alliance program in Latin America, to handle export
                    promotion and capital markets developments. These were the so-called Nixon
                    initiatives for which money was made available. I have a feeling, quite frankly,
                    that the reason I was named to this job was because I had a large Democratic tag
                    on me and everybody figured that the programs were going to fail and they could
                    blame it on the fact that they were sabotaged by a Democrat. And I think that
                    was probably a fair way of doing things. Unfortunately, the program worked.
                    Those two programs, I might add, were basically programs which we operated
                    through the Organization of American States and they worked out reasonably
                    well.</p>
                <p>I then moved into the technical assistance job in which we complemented the
                    lending program as we had been doing in the past in the fields of agriculture,
                    education, housing, things of that nature. We had staffs in Washington and large
                    numbers of personnel in Latin America carrying out grant-funded operations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the atmosphere of the Nixon period in AID in
                        Washington and the Kennedy/Johnson period? Was there a difference?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: Yes, I think so. Obviously there wasn't as much emphasis on the operation.
                    Nixon had no particular love for Latin America in view of the way he was treated
                    when he went down there as Vice President. He hadn't much interest in Latin
                    America. Nevertheless it was continued. There was no emphasis on it particularly
                    as a part of US policy, at least I never felt there was much of an emphasis on
                    it. The people who were running the AID program were, I think, focusing on other
                    areas of the world rather than Latin America. The Latin America program sort of
                    ran on its own without any real interest on the part of the White House.Congress
                    continued it pretty much at the same level. It was a moribund program. There was
                    none of the excitement that had been around earlier. Maybe it had been around
                    too long.</p>
                <p>I retired then because there was the possibly that by retiring before July 1,
                    1973 one would get a pension that would have required you to work another ten
                    years to equal if you stayed in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We kept having these so-called windows as a great
                        inducement to get people out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: And since people had been after me to go back to Argentina and work in
                    private industry, it seemed like the right time to do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Stan, I want to thank you very much. It was
                        great.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GRAND: Thank you.</p>
