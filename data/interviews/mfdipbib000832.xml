                <p>AMBASSADOR GEORGE ALLEN MORGAN</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Arthur L. Lowrie </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: December 23, 1989</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ambassador Morgan it's a great pleasure, an honor for me
                        to have this opportunity to talk to you about your very distinguished and
                        long career. If we could begin with how you got your first interest in
                        foreign affairs, coming as you did from an academic background, and how you
                        entered the Foreign Service I think would be of great interest.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: When World War II broke out I was teaching philosophy at Duke but wanted
                    to get into the war. So in the end I just let myself be drafted as a plain
                    Private and began my military service that way with basic training. Then I did
                    OCS at the Field Artillery School and served overseas. But during this period I
                    decided I didn't want to go back to academic life; I wanted something more
                    active and so I thought of Washington as the best place for somebody of my
                    background to look, and so I did. I came to Washington after I got out of the
                    Army and knocked on various doors and interviewed with various people. And it
                    turned out that the State Department was the most likely place for me and the
                    work I was most interested in. I got a job first in the State Department as a
                    writer, of all things. That I did for a short time. Then in 1947 I applied for
                    lateral entry into the Foreign Service. At that time there was a War Manpower
                    Act, I think they called it, which was trying to recruit people at middle grade,
                    rather than just at the bottom of the Service because during the war they hadn't
                    had any replacements. So I got in, luckily at Class 3, was given the usual
                    introductory course, and then an intensive course in Russian language. I
                    expressed special interest in Russia and Russian, so I did that in the summer.
                    Then in the fall, winter, and spring I had an academic year at the Russian
                    Institute of Columbia and did background Russian studies. While there I wrote,
                    for a Seminar, a big paper entitled “Stalin on Revolution”, which later was
                    condensed by the editor of Foreign Affairs and published in Foreign Affairs
                    called “Stalin on Revolution” in January 1949. It was a huge success. For a
                    brief time I was a world celebrity [laughter]. Although it was published
                    anonymously under the pseudonym “historicus non de plume”, Time magazine soon
                    found out who it was and so I became known. Meanwhile, I had been sent to my
                    first post, Moscow, in 1948.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During that period, did you have some contact with George
                        Kennan?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>MORGAN: I can't remember where I met him first, I think I did. It may have been
                    later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your first post then was in Moscow?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Moscow, where for one year I was head of USIS. My position was Cultural
                    Officer or Cultural Affairs Officer. Then the second year I was moved to the
                    Chancery and became the sort of main Political Officer for Soviet affairs for a
                    year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Ambassador then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: The first year it was Bedell Smith. The second year it was Ambassador
                    Alan Kirk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you work fairly closely with both of them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Well, as Cultural Officer I wasn't, of course, very close to the
                    Ambassador. I was off in another building and doing the sort of affairs that he
                    didn't have much time to get into, but we were on a good friendly basis anyway.
                    In the case of Ambassador Kirk, I was very close because of my new position as
                    the Soviet Specialist in his Chancery and I even lived in Spaso House, the
                    Ambassador's residence with him and Mrs. Kirk, because it was customary to have
                    a Russian language officer live in the residence for cases when they needed a
                    Russian speaker right there. So I got to know the Kirk's extremely well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What's your view of Ambassador Kirk in the professional
                        sense?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Fine. I liked him very much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a professional sense?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes. He was a retired Admiral from the Navy. He had been in charge of the
                    D-Day landings, ferrying our troops across to Normandy when we began invading
                    the continent and then he had been Ambassador to Belgium, I think it was, before
                    he came to Moscow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Within the Embassy, there weren't any great differences of
                        opinion about the approach to the Soviet Union, about the policy of
                        containment and so forth?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Not that I recall.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything that I don't ask but that you feel is important
                        to note, please put it in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Alright.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything more about Moscow in those days and Ambassador
                        Kirk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Well there were lots of details. I don't know that for your purposes what
                    else you would like to hear.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, for example, after serving there, seeing Stalin
                        operate firsthand, did you revise any of your views that you'd expressed in
                        this Foreign Affairs article?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: No. I actually met Stalin. I went with Ambassador Kirk when he called on
                    Stalin, so I've shaken hands with the biggest murderer in history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you moved directly from Moscow to Berlin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes, to my great disappointment. I wanted to round out my normal of tour
                    of three years in Moscow because it was a fascinating post and I was delighted
                    with it. In fact, toward the end of my stay there I wrote a dispatch which
                    indicated that the Russians were likely to start some kind of war somewhere
                    around the world—a proxy war maybe. I didn't pinpoint Korea, but at least it
                    gave a kind of general alert to something like Korea being on the cards. So I
                    was very pleased by that bit of foresight. Well, I was then yanked to Berlin
                    ahead of time because they wanted somebody in Berlin with some sort of Soviet
                    background who would head a unit that would report on East Germany, in
                    particular, and the Soviet Bloc, in general, as seen from Berlin. In those days,
                    Berlin was not a divided city. You could go over to the East, the Soviet sector,
                    without any difficulty and we could get the East German paper every day, which
                    gave us their news we could report. So I went there and there were several fine
                    officers who became part of my staff, political and economic. I was Director of
                    Eastern Element. It had two divisions, Political and Economic, and it was
                    attached to Berlin Element for Administration. Berlin Element had to do with
                    local Berlin affairs. The Director of Berlin Element was the Political Advisor
                    to the General who was the Commandant of the US sector of Berlin. So I was able
                    to call my outfit Eastern Element because it was reporting on the East. I had a
                    very happy time there, fascinating work and great freedom to do as I pleased and
                    report as I pleased. I didn't have to clear it with anybody—just send what I
                    felt like unless I was recommending policy in which case, of course, I did have
                    to clear it with McLoy who was the High Commissioner, stationed in
                    Frankfurt.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to travel in Eastern Europe at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: No. It wasn't feasible to travel in Eastern Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a close working relationship with McLoy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Not terribly. I would go down to Frankfurt about once a week to his staff
                    meeting and report, along with lots of the other people. That's about as close
                    as I ever got to him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Berlin then when the Korean War began? Is that
                        correct? June 1950?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes I was. I was there 1950 and 1951. Late 1951 I was yanked back to the
                    States, much to my regret.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wanted to ask about the Korean War. When the war broke
                        out in Korea, you'd predicted that kind of thing. Was it seen then by you
                        and others in Berlin as a diversionary kind of activity by the Communists
                        and that a real thrust may be coming in Europe at the same time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: We couldn't help comparing the North and South Korea with East and West
                    Germany. And we noted the arms buildup in East Germany. So, we obviously called
                    attention to the possibility of another proxy war there. This was long before
                    NATO and all that, and long before West Germany was allowed to re-arm.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're saying that you then again had your tour cut short
                        and back to Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes, they were always after my body. I wished they'd leave me alone. I
                    had just gotten married and we were happily settled into Berlin and had only two
                    or three months of happy married life there and had to go back. Somebody had
                    pull with somebody high up in the administration in the State Department. It was
                    Foy Kohler—he was then running the Voice of America in New York—and he wanted a
                    Russian specialist there, which was quite natural, so they axed me for it.
                    Fortunately, when I got back to Washington I got yanked again. They were
                    starting something called the Psychological Strategy Board in Washington, and
                    Gordon Gray, the Director, heard about me, and interviewed me, and got my
                    assignment changed. So I became an Assistant Director at the Psychological
                    Strategy Board.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I hadn't heard of that before. What exactly was that
                        Psychological Strategy Board and what was it supposed to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: It was, I think, basically a can of worms invented by the Bureau of the
                    Budget. It didn't really do anything to amount to much, but the idea was to set
                    up a coordinating group that would mobilize our whole Government, all our
                    Government resources in fighting what people liked to call the “Cold War” in
                    those days—propaganda and God knows what all. So the Board consisted of the
                    Under Secretary of State, Deputy Secretary of Defense, the Director of CIA and
                    possibly on or two more—I can't remember. And the staff, which was headed by the
                    Director, first Gordon Gray, then another man whose name I have forgotten, and
                    finally by Ambassador Kirk, who came back from Moscow and became my boss again,
                    to my pleasure. So that lasted the rest of the Truman Administration. With
                    Eisenhower there were plans for doing something different. So while that new
                    organization was being ginned up, I was made Acting Director of PSB for just the
                    interim period, keeping the old machinery going until the new machine was
                    ready.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do, write papers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes, we wrote papers and plans and what not. I remember one thing. The
                    sort of gleam in the eye of all the psychological warriors in those days was
                    what to do in case Stalin died. This would be a great occasion for a
                    psychological warfare or God knows what. But nobody did anything about it.
                    Finally I did write a contingency plan for the death of Stalin and cleared it at
                    the “working level”. Finally, Stalin did die, but that was on into the
                    Eisenhower Administration and the new body which took the place of PSB was
                    called OCB, Operations Coordinating Board, of which I was the Deputy Executive
                    Officer for a time. But by that time, of course, PSB papers didn't count for
                    anything, so I don't know if my paper was even looked at. But we did a crash
                    exercise with the staff at the time of Stalin's death working on some new plans,
                    but I don't think they ever amounted to anything.</p>

                    emphasis. So I guess to that extent I did know.</p>

                <p>MORGAN: No, I thought the military was very important. In fact, one part of my
                    job was to be an advisor from PSB or OCB to the NSC Planning Board. NSC then was
                    a top-level thing with the President and the Secretaries and there was a staff
                    level and I was an advisor on that in my capacity from PSB and OCB. And I
                    remember once writing a memo, distributed to my colleagues on the Planning
                    Board—saying you shouldn't call it the “Cold War”; the “Creeping War” is what
                    you should call it as evidenced by that time in Korea and Southeast Asia.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: I don't know why I was posted to Japan. All I knew was after I had spent
                    a year as Deputy Executive Officer of OCB, I felt I had done my duty there with
                    PSB and OCB and it was time for a change. So I went to Bedell Smith, who was
                    then Under Secretary of State, and asked him for his advice, and he then poked
                    up the personnel people and they assigned me as Political Counselor in Tokyo. I
                    don't know why, but there I was and I was glad to go. It was a fascinating new
                    experience, a different part of the world, different culture.</p>

                <p>MORGAN: Japan was just gradually creeping out from the vast losses of World War
                    II and the main thing we were trying to do was help Japan get back economically,
                    and to secure their alignment politically as an ally against the Soviet Union.
                    So one of the main accomplishments, as I recall, during my day was a security
                    treaty with Japan which secured that. But I must say considering how Japan's
                    economy has flourished, amazingly flourished since then, we had no inkling that
                    they were going to do as much as they have.</p>

                <p>MORGAN: I more than completed it. I had planned to take the usual three years,
                    then home leave, then go on to another post. So I had postponed home leave for
                    this purpose when I might have taken it after two years. But when Doug MacArthur
                    came, he insisted on keeping me for a fourth year, to my great regret because I
                    had hoped, in fact I had been promised, a good DCM assignment somewhere. This
                    not only delayed it, it in the end prevented it, it because toward the end of my
                    fourth year I was again yanked back, this time to State Department Policy

                <p>MORGAN: I don't know who suggested my name. I could guess, but I don't see any
                    point in guessing. Anyway, Gerard C. Smith was the Assistant Secretary in charge
                    of Policy Planning and it was he who asked for me. And being part of the
                    Secretary's office, Policy Planning right next door to the Secretary, he had
                    pull. Doug very kindly protested on my behalf but they insisted. So I spent the
                    next seven years in Washington, to my regret, never getting the DCM post I
                    wanted and only after seven years the Ambassadorship to the Ivory Coast.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Four years in Policy Planning, three years in the Foreign Service

                <p>MORGAN: I don't think I concentrated a great deal. Probably more in the Far East
                    and the Soviet Union, the two places where I had the most familiarity. But after
                    one year, I think, I became Deputy. First to Gerard Smith and then to my

                    cranking out lots of papers. So we did. And Walt Rostow was a very prolific
                    writer himself and he did a lot on his own. About the only thing I remember
                    doing under Walt, and at his request, was writing a paper on how to develop
                    areas of common interest with the Soviet Union, which I did, and in my
                    recommendations I said they should be developed with dogged caution.

                        today.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: It was suppressed because soon after it was produced they had the Cuban
                    Missile Crisis and the White House ordered the paper suppressed. [laughter] I
                    don't know why, the paper did no damage.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Chester Bowles was also very interested in Policy
                        Planning, was he not?</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Cuban Missile Crisis, did that come as a great
                        surprise to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: No, I really wasn't following those things. I think I was already
                    Director of the Foreign Service Institute so out of Policy Planning then, not
                    following current affairs. Anyway it was a bit of a surprise, I think, to many
                    Soviet specialists because as far as we knew the Russians had not previously
                    placed atomic weapons in another country. That much risk, so to speak, was new
                    to us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did anybody in those years, did anybody in Policy Planning
                        or elsewhere in the Government, even dare suggest that the Communist regimes
                        in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe could change through peaceful means
                        the way it's happening today?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The assumption always was that the Communist government
                        would act brutally to keep that from happening wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes. There was no inkling of this kind of development. I think possibly
                    in the long run it was envisioned by George Kennan in his containment thesis
                    that if after many years they were successfully contained, they might mellow
                    internally.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have anything to do with President Kennedy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Not particularly. When I was Director of the Foreign Service Institute, I
                    did accompany the students in a new course on counter-insurgency to visit
                    President Kennedy in the White House, because he was specially interested in it.
                    In fact, I had been assigned to FSI because he wanted such a course developed.
                    Secondly, before he went to Berlin the President wanted some elementary
                    instruction in German. So Mac Bundy called me over and asked me to arrange it,
                    and I did. I sent my best German teacher over to Kennedy so he could say, rather
                    incorrectly, “Ich Bin Ein Berliner”. He should have said, “Ich Bin Berliner”.
                    The “Ein” wasn't proper, but anyway it's in history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Based on your career thus far, what were your credentials
                        for being chosen to head the Foreign Service Institute to establish
                        counter-insurgency in Southeast Asia? You had a special interest in it?
                        You'd written something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: No, I believe in Policy Planning one of our men had written a paper on
                    counter-insurgency, but it wasn't my paper and I don't think I was chosen for
                    that reason. Why I was chosen exactly, I don't know, but they wanted somebody
                    who was highly regarded in the Service, and very possibly my academic background
                    gave them a clue too. At that time President Kennedy was trying to create a new
                    kind of Foreign Service Institute which would have a different name, perhaps
                    called the Academy of Foreign Affairs or National Academy of Foreign Affairs,
                    something like that. There were a whole bunch of people developing plans for
                    that purpose. So my job at the Foreign Service Institute was really getting on
                    with the business meanwhile. But the National Academy was never achieved. For
                    one reason, they didn't consult Congress, at least adequately. So there was no
                    support in Congress for this kind of thing. Then, of course, Kennedy was
                    assassinated and that was the end of all that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you pleased with your assignment to direct the
                        Foreign Service Institute?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: No, I was heartbroken, but I had to go. The Secretary wanted me to go and
                    the Foreign Service is like the Army, you take orders. No, I was dying for an
                    overseas post, hopefully an Ambassadorship, but anyway having been all these
                    years in Washington, to have to do three more was painful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you accomplish as Director of the Foreign Service

                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Well, I launched that counter-insurgency course—I forget what we called
                    it, interdepartmental seminar or something or other—and I developed a course on
                    science in foreign affairs, and a course for Foreign Service wives, which my
                    wife designed incidentally, very ably.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's still going on too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Is it? Good. We developed a whole field of area studies to match language
                    studies so that officers who went there to study a language would also learn
                    something about the area in which that language was spoken, so they'd get
                    pertinent background.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I benefitted from that because I was in Arabic Language

                <p>ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS:</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was it you were chosen to become Ambassador to the
                        Ivory Coast?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: I don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Ivory Coast was quite a change for you after your
                        previous experience all in developed industrialized countries. How did you
                        enjoy it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Very much. They were friendly, intelligent people, governed by a great
                    President, just getting started with independence after many years as a French
                    colony. I was happy to serve in such a different part of the world, in such a
                    different culture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to travel around the country much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes, a great deal, and I did so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the principal goals of the United States at that
                        time in the Ivory Coast given the dominant position of France?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: We had no major goals, just being helpful in a tactful and friendly
                    way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any problems during your period of
                        Ambassadorship with interagency differences or with persuading Washington to
                        pursue the kinds of policies you recommended?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>MORGAN: No interagency differences. I had some difficulty persuading Washington
                    to help finance a dam to generate electric power, but I finally succeeded.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What led to your decision to retire from the Foreign
                        Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: I wasn't offered an interesting assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you please say something about your very active
                        post-retirement activities, and particularly the book which you had
                        published?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: A year or two after I retired, I decided to write a book on the
                    philosophy of my friend Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy, then an emeritus professor at
                    Dartmouth. So I obtained all his writings, took elaborate notes and finally
                    wrote the book, Speech and Society: The Christian Linguistic Social Philosophy
                    of Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy. The book took me about fourteen years.</p>
