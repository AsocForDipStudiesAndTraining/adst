                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Alright Paul, let's start at the beginning. Could you tell
                        me where and when you were born, and a little about your family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: I was born in Fort Lee, Virginia on February 1, 1950. My father was a
                    career army man; at that point I think he was a private or a PFC (Private First
                    Class). He was stationed down there. My brother came along about fifteen months
                    later. Then we went up to live in Toms River, New Jersey, with my grandparents
                    while my father went off to fight in Korea. We joined my father in Tokyo and I
                    had a sister who was born there. This would've been about 1953; she was actually
                    born in 1954, and late 1954 we returned to the U.S. (United States) and went to
                    Fort Eustace, Virginia. I started school there in a private kindergarten which
                    many, many years later I realized, was both private and segregated, but it
                    wasn't the sort of thing that occurred to me at the time.</p>
                <p>My father got orders and in 1956 we were transferred to Nuremberg, Germany; we
                    actually lived in Fuerth at 44 Eisenstrasse. I remember that because it's the
                    first phrase I ever learned in German. My sister, Marcia, was born there, and we
                    were in Fuerth until something like 1957 when there was some sort of major
                    transfer involving different army units, both in the States and in Europe.
                    Suddenly we were sent to Mainz, Germany, just across the river from Wiesbaden,
                    which was an Air Force patch. We were moved into some housing quarters that were
                    about the worst I had ever seen, and this is even as an eight year old. I think
                    French-Moroccan troops had been in there. They were a shambles.</p>
                <p>We stayed in Mainz and we left in September of 1958 when my father was
                    transferred with his unit - he was part of the advance party - to Fort Riley,
                    Kansas. There wasn't enough housing on base, so we ended up living in a town
                    called Wakefield, Kansas and I went to school there, which was sort of the
                    quintessential Midwestern experience. My dad managed to get transferred to Fort
                    Dix, New Jersey because my mother is from the Jersey shore, he's from eastern
                    Pennsylvania, and we lived in the town of Pemberton, which we'll come back to
                    because that's where my mother still lives.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me stop at this point. Could you tell me a little
                        about your family's background on your father's side, and then we'll go to
                        your mother's side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: My father's family is basically Pennsylvania Dutch. He was actually born
                    out of wedlock; long, shaggy dog story involving my grandmother when she was
                    sixteen. He was actually born in a reformatory in Trenton, New Jersey. He grew
                    up bouncing between the family farm in Bordentown, New Jersey and Norristown and
                    Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds like a rather difficult life.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Very much so. Actually he went off under-age near the end of World War II
                    and joined the navy. My grandmother tracked him down and got him yanked out just
                    as he was finishing basic training. At this point, I think my grandparents had
                    separated and he came back, went to school, got in trouble, and as he always
                    cryptically referred to it, he was a Pennsylvania volunteer in 1946, which was
                    he was given the choice between reform school or the army, so he took the
                    army.</p>
                <p>He was sent to, at that point, post-war Germany, and actually was one of the
                    guards in Nuremberg when they hung Goering - well, I guess Goering committed
                    suicide, but other war criminals were hung. He got out, came back to the States,
                    had sent money home which my grandmother had given to her no-account sister, so
                    he stayed there, tried to help get her out of debt, came home one day,
                    discovered she was still sending money to the no- account sister, so he went
                    back in the service.</p>
                <p>He was stationed at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, and he met my mother at a USO
                    (United Service Organizations, Incorporated) dance where he showed up drunk and
                    one of his buddies bet him five dollars that he couldn't dance with the girl in
                    the red dress. Well he won the bet and started going out with her.</p>
                <p>My mother's family; eastern European, Jewish. My grandfather was born in Jersey
                    City; my grandmother was born on the lower east side. They had moved to Asbury
                    Park and had a grocery store that failed, and then moved to Toms River, New
                    Jersey, just before the war and my mother graduated from high school during the
                    war. It was actually quite interesting because Fort Monmouth (and I think she
                    was at Camp Evans) and the communications people approached the Jewish
                    communities and were looking for secretaries and technicians. They had problems
                    getting people because of the German-American Bund, the Italian League, and
                    others. So at eighteen, my mother was doing top-secret work.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was handy that German-American Bund and the Italian
                        League, I mean this meant that security clearances were harder to get,
                        whereas with American-Jewish personnel you're not going to get much tie to
                        the Fascist regime.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: No, and I think the statement was there was a feeling in the Jewish
                    community that something truly horrific was happening to the Jews in Europe. So
                    there was no question about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much of a Jewish influence in your family? I
                        mean, your grandparents; was this sort of an eastern European tie, or not,
                        or sub-related or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: They had pretty much assimilated; there was no knowledge of ties in
                    Eastern Europe, in that my great-great-grandparents had been brought over as
                    children in the 1870s and so forth. But I mean, a very, very Jewish environment
                    and I was reared in the faith. I was Bar Mitzvahed in the former SS Headquarters
                    for southern Germany. So there was always an awareness of both sides of the
                    family, but clearly my grandparents were a huge influence. It was, in a sense,
                    the classic Jewish story of it's not will you go to college, it's when you go to
                    college, and where. Which segues back to my mother as the daughter of this
                    background who shows up with her German-American soldier in 1949; this was not a
                    particularly popular program. It was really my grandfather who put the foot down
                    as?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which grandfather?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: My mother's father; the Jewish one who when my parents said they were
                    going to run away and get married; announced that his family didn't do that and
                    wasn't going to do that. They were actually married in my aunt's house - my
                    mother's sister, and the agreement was that the children would be reared as
                    Jews, which is what happened. My father actually converted to Judaism during the
                    Korean War. So that's always been a strong Jewish influence. My family is
                    involved in charities. My sister is president of the Temple Sisterhood in
                    Hadassah. Not in New York City, but a smaller town on the East Coast.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the politics; so often in the Jewish community,
                        particularly I think of New York, or maybe Miami, of getting involved in,
                        you know, I won't say really left wing, but you know, sort of solidly
                        democratic and all of that. Was this a small town; might be different?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>TYSON: Interestingly enough, not entirely so. My mother's mother, in her early
                    stages, used to joke about having been a Socialist. At fourteen, on the lower
                    east side, she'd wear a longer skirt so that she'd look older when she was
                    giving speeches on Washington Square. Her brothers actually turned into
                    Rockefeller Republicans holding elected positions on the east coast of north
                    Jersey.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Jacob Javits and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: The Jake Javits type. They certainly knew the Democrats and my aunt later
                    got very heavily involved in the Democratic Party, but actually always fairly
                    centrist, fairly bourgeois. You know, “Oh my God, we need a hospital. I guess we
                    better form a committee,” type of thing. There were actually leftists down
                    there; the Rosenberg kids had ended up at Toms River under a different name.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean Joel and Ethel Rosenberg who were quite famous
                        for being involved, and executed for being a spy case; the atomic spy
                        case.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: The kids apparently had ended up with another family, and actually in Toms
                    River. My grandmother and grandfather were very involved in the mainstream
                    synagogue there, but there was a smaller one that my grandmother used to refer
                    to as “the leftists”. Another interesting one would be the discussions among the
                    tribes. She would occasionally say, “We don't talk to them. The grandfather does
                    numbers for the mob.” It's always been sort of interesting of how the American
                    Jewish community has airbrushed their involvement in this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. You know there was a particularly, the name
                        doesn't come to me, but there was a very strong Jewish element [in the
                        mafia].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Well, Meyer Lansky and all in Cuba.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Meyer Lansky; that's the name I was thinking of.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: I was just down in Havana doing inspections; went past the hotel he
                    built.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your father; did you sense a, coming from a very
                        difficult childhood, concern about lack of education? Sometimes the military
                        can make up for this, or not. Was there much interest there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>TYSON: He got his high school certificate in the military, and certainly for
                    many, many people it was an avenue of mobility. He never went to OCS [Officers
                    Candidate School] or anything like that. I think in many ways, my mother's
                    family provided a great deal of framework to him, although his mother was always
                    around and was just a wonderful woman. But in terms of the broader frameworks in
                    this society, it was more focused on my mother's family. It was interesting
                    because not having grown up with it, he attempted to prepare us for
                    anti-Semitism, or “this might happen, that might happen,” and by and large, by
                    the time we came along, we were running with a crowd including bankers' kids; I
                    don't think this is an issue. In terms of the education and stuff, I don't think
                    he ever knew what his kids experienced. First of all, the military schools
                    overseas, in spite of a lot of people wincing about them, actually were pretty
                    good. You tended to get, in the '50s and '60s, more adventurous teachers out of
                    the States who were interested in being overseas, and I would say, by and large,
                    the quality of education I got was superior to what I came back to the States
                    to. But when the time came I did better than my brother did and it was clear
                    that I had a shot at some fairly good schools in America. My mother and my
                    mother's family was saying, “Go for the Ivy League or something,” while dad was
                    saying, “You know there are good state teachers colleges in Pennsylvania,” and
                    it was just fine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back to growing up now. Firstly, what branch of
                        the military was your father in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: He was in transportation at first and then he was in the infantry. He was
                    a basic training sergeant; he was a basic training sergeant at Riley and then at
                    Dix. He got out of the Service in '66. I remember going occasionally. The
                    recruits would buy candy for us because they had him for eight weeks and we had
                    him for life. He had a rough childhood and he was a man who with an explosive
                    temper and there was a lot about childhood that wasn't all sweetness and light.
                    It wasn't easy growing up with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a lot of “Yes, Daddy. Sir,” type of stuff? I was
                        wondering whether sometimes military discipline sort of permeates; the
                        fathers put it on the kids.</hi>

                <p>TYSON: The fathers definitely put a lot of it on the kids, and there's a problem
                    with that. I'll lay it out by saying when we were in Germany, the men would go
                    out to the field for sixty to ninety days at a time, leaving the women in the
                    housing areas without any real language skills. With three, four, five kids,
                    whatever, and left there to cope. So, I got the lecture, and I know my friends
                    did: “You're the oldest. I'm gone. You need to stand in. Here's what you need to
                    do with your mother,” and “help out with the family.” By and large, particularly
                    since they were teaching us the language in school, I wasn't fluent, but I knew
                    more than my mother. You're sort of the half-adult. In many ways, there's an
                    extraordinary amount of responsibility which in my case and some of my friends
                    cases, we more than undertook. Fine, gotta do this. Consulting with your mother
                    on car repairs or this or that, or “How do we get the engineers out here to fix
                    this?” And then the old men (the fathers) would come in from the field,
                    generally having been out there telling lies to each other for sixty to ninety
                    days about how their wives with five kids are no doubt having affairs with
                    privates or the kids are just out of hand and will need the iron rod when the
                    old man reappears. And he'd show up, and I mean, having done this for sixty or
                    ninety days, help pulling things together, he's go off on a tear about
                    something. It was almost like, “Look, would you just find something wrong so
                    that we can get the explosion out of the way?”</p>
                <p>I remember when I was in my late '20s, in the Foreign Service, married, back from
                    my first tour in Germany, and I was out driving with my father and he said,
                    “Well, I know I was tough on you, but you never lied to me.” I looked at him and
                    said, “We lied to you all the time because you never wanted to hear the truth;
                    you'd pop us one for telling you a lie.” So figure out what you want, get it
                    over with, and be done with it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go to high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Pemberton Township High School in Pemberton, New Jersey, which is right
                    outside the gates of Fort Dix. We left Munich in 1963. We had gone to Germany in
                    '61 to Ulm and transferred to Munich. And actually, I trained for my Bar Mitzvah
                    under the chaplain there and was Bar Mitzvahed in Munich. I came back when I had
                    finished seventh grade and I was taking a lot of advanced placement courses. I
                    came back to eighth grade in Pemberton, which, quite frankly, I had already
                    done. I had a good teacher who gave me little projects to do, but I had done the
                    year already. And then did four years of high school there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well tell me, in this family atmosphere did you have much
                        time to read or see movies? I mean, what did you do at that time before you
                        hit high school? What do you get active with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: I was in Boy Scouts, but I had always read voraciously and there were
                    always movies around on the army base.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 25 cents.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: 25 cents. I think it went up to 50 cents. Fifteen cents or something, but?
                    No, movies were only one thing, and particularly overseas, my God, the field
                    trips. You know, let's go to museums, let's go here, let's go there. I was
                    always being placed into the top academic group, so I was hanging out with my
                    little buddies, you know, building nuclear devices for science fairs or things
                    like that. It was actually fairly good, because I could use this to intimidate
                    my father, “I'm doing a science project. Leave me alone,” and it seemed to
                    work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ah, the strategies that one learns.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: I had friends doing much the same thing. It's striking in terms of the
                    military schools because these people came in from the wrong side of the tracks,
                    and the military was an avenue of mobility upward, starting with the kids. Where
                    it was most striking was the black kids that I grew up with, because in the '60s
                    and later when American colleges discovered the fact that they did not have
                    black students, who better than military or Foreign Service brats?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At high school, I imagine that the student body was pretty
                        heavily military, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Pretty much just going through the academic ropes. Once again, I was
                    tracked into the top academic group; the 'nerd patrol' or the 'brain trust'.
                    That got progressively smaller as I went on to my senior year. I still have
                    friends from that time and that era. But it was also sort of gaming college
                    applications; you had to have activities. So I actually ended up running track,
                    badly, for three years and then I was the manager of the football and basketball
                    teams, and sports editor of the school newspaper, audio-visual aids club and
                    stuff like that.</p>
                <p>I was also involved in United Synagogue Youth, which was an interesting insight
                    into another world because south Jersey is small towns; there are Jewish
                    communities, but you're a definite minority. Not a discriminated minority, but
                    as a result, when they were doing youth activities, you'd be driving sixty,
                    seventy miles into Delaware to do things. So you knew kids in other schools,
                    other places. It was more than just your high school crowd. This was definitely
                    a crowd that everybody was being pretty much tracked to go to college. The
                    “which med school do you want to go to?” type of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think about New Jersey and my experience as a consular
                        officer. There's a sizeable Arab community around there. I was wondering
                        whether you ever ran across Yemeni, Syrian, and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: No. The part of New Jersey that Pemberton is in is the Pine Barrens, which
                    is really much more like Mississippi or Georgia. You know, deer hunting season
                    comes and half of your class is out on the first day. Pretty much an
                    anti-intellectual environment, you know, girls get married at eighteen or
                    nineteen, that type of thing. I had a high school classmate, a black guy, who
                    was knifed to death, senior year, on the lawn of his mistress/girlfriend's house
                    that he'd already had a baby with. That type of thing. Tom Whitewall, who sat
                    behind me in home room, who could drop a Corvette transmission in nine minutes
                    and did. In that environment, particularly in the gym classes, you're one of the
                    weird nerds. There were about fifteen to twenty of us, where I think
                    instinctively some of the kids that were not particularly going to go anywhere
                    in life could look at you, sneer at you, but they sort of knew that it was going
                    to be different for you. And that engendered a certain resentment that I think
                    now is more understandable than it was then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were going through this, and particularly
                        involved with Jewish religious groups, were you getting much about Israel
                        and all that? I mean, was this a cause that was pushed or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: My grandmother, may she rest in peace, is an absolute legend in the
                    Hadassah. Absolutely. I mean, the certificates were up on Grandma's wall. My
                    aunt has been involved in it, my mother is, my sister has gotten involved in
                    charities and activities in New Jersey, and one of the reasons is she is Julia
                    Presloff's granddaughter. She is Evelyn Silvert's niece; she is Myra Tyson's
                    daughter. That's who Marcia Wasupman is.</p>
                <p>The causes of Israel were absolutely always there. You know, very heavily Israel,
                    but there's also the local synagogue, the local hospital which is for the
                    broader community, it's not a Jewish charity. And other issues. It's that
                    tradition of “tzedakah;” charity and broad community involvement. But no, very,
                    very heavily involved in it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When it came around to going to college, where were you
                        sort of pointed towards, coming out of a New Jersey high school? I mean, how
                        did this work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>TYSON: Pemberton did not particularly do well placing people. The year I went, I
                    went to Dartmouth and one of my classmates went to Cornell and this was just a
                    huge breakthrough. The guidance office always had places like West Virginia
                    University, Murray State College in Paducah, Kentucky, where they could slot
                    people. I was sort of on the edge with my SATs (Standard Achievement Tests) and
                    the grades and stuff, and I thought I had a shot, not a guarantee, so it made
                    sense to roll the dice and I tried a number of Ivy League schools and got into
                    Dartmouth and Columbia. Got turned down at Harvard, Yale, and Brown. Honors
                    program at Virginia, Bucknell and a few other things. It was percentage shooting
                    that worked out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to Dartmouth from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: 1968 to 1972.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dartmouth, I always think, “Dartmouth's in town again. Run
                        girls, run.” You know, you're up there somewhat isolated and all of that.
                        What was Dartmouth like when you got there in '68?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Traditional all male New England school. The “Dartmouth is in town again”
                    was absolutely true. It was interesting. At that point, I had been dating in
                    high school. I had one or two of the first really serious love affairs behind me
                    at that point. So I wasn't totally wet behind the ears. But I had gone to a
                    public high school and I found this all male environment, particularly the ones
                    coming out of prep school, just a little strange and immature. The stuff about
                    alcohol - you know, I'd grown up in Europe. I drank, so what? But there were
                    people who would absolutely seek to get totally destroyed. And of course at that
                    point, all of the drugs were really just beginning to come onto the college
                    campuses big time. It was certainly all around there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Dartmouth going through a change? I think of Dartmouth
                        and most of those schools as being pretty Waspish (White Anglo-Saxon
                        Protestant) at that point, but maybe not that point, maybe they were
                        changing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: They were still fairly WASPy, as a matter of fact, my mother's family had
                    some distant cousins who went to Dartmouth and Princeton, but it was ten to
                    fifteen years earlier and it was very much under the Jewish quota system which I
                    think by the time I came along had pretty much eroded. So the opportunities were
                    better.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>I had a distant cousin who was a year ahead of me at Dartmouth. It wasn't totally
                    unknown, but there was this feeling that these schools actively did discriminate
                    against Jews. Of course, the difference between being Jewish and going to
                    Columbia or Penn versus Dartmouth with, you know, blonde boys with skis is
                    different. On the other hand, on army bases a small southern town, I had grown
                    up in essentially broadly gentile environments. It wasn't totally strange.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, one of the people I think of - a much earlier era,
                        but Bud Schulberg went to Dartmouth and came out, I assume, of a Jewish
                        family.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Yes. There was always a group up there, and there was a Jewish student
                    group, and there was a Hillel, and indeed I ended up becoming vice president of
                    it. But it was actually very funny; the ones who were more involved in organized
                    Judaism as opposed to, if you will, cultural Judaism, were the ones from small
                    towns; Shawnee Mission, Kansas, Ohio, where part of your definition of Judaism
                    is that you join the organization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a little bit like people coming out of a Protestant,
                        Baptist church. I mean, if you come from a small town, you have to
                        participate, whereas if you were to come out of New York, you know?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: It's your option.</p>
                <p>Dartmouth was clearly changing and one of the small ways it changed ultimately
                    helped me in terms of the Foreign Service. I was in a senior honor society.
                    Well, they sort of abolished themselves. That was also the time the student body
                    voted itself out of existence. One of my classmates in the freshman class, who
                    is now general counsel of Oracle, knew people in the admissions office, so they
                    decided to hire guides and went around and made the offer to about ten of us. So
                    I was a college tour guide for four years, which was an invaluable experience in
                    handling future CODELs (congressional delegations). But, I mean, those types of
                    things had changed at Dartmouth. The parties were just as wild, if not wilder,
                    because they got rid of restrictions in the dorm rooms so we could have girls in
                    the rooms. You did have sex, drugs, and rock-and-roll, but it was still a very
                    good school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll come to the studies later, but while we're heading
                        on the social side, '68 to '72 was a big protest time and all of that. Was
                        there much to protest about at Dartmouth?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Oh, huge amounts. You were not isolated from the broader national issue;
                    the Draft was hanging over everybody's head. In '70, with Kent State we had the
                    student strike and actually the administration finessed it where you could elect
                    not to finish classes, but there would be a statement on your transcript. I
                    chose to finish up.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>Let's see, freshman year was the takeover of the administration hall, Parkhurst.
                    I was sunbathing on the lawn when that happened. Some of my classmates were
                    hauled off. Sophomore year was Kent State. Junior year was something else
                    involving Vietnam. I mean, the protests were there.</p>
                <p>People had friends at other schools. Dartmouth had a student body that drew from
                    the country as a whole, so there was an awareness of it. It was much cozier; you
                    sort of knew everybody. I mean, it's not like Wisconsin with 30,000 people and
                    I've never seen them, it's the guy down the hall or someone who was in this or
                    that class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you taking?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Government and urban studies. I was interested in pol/sci [political
                    science]and international affairs. There was no separate international affairs;
                    I just biased a lot of my pol/sci courses towards that. I had an ROTC (Reserve
                    Officers Training Corps) scholarship and the army withdrew that, so by the end
                    of my sophomore year I was going to possibly have to transfer, so sophomore year
                    I loaded in a lot of my major courses. Turns out I didn't have to; Dartmouth
                    came up with some money and I stayed on. But by junior year I'd actually had a
                    lot of what I needed to do out of the way, so winter quarter I went off and did
                    an “Outward Bound” quarter, which Dartmouth runs through the Tuck Foundation, a
                    special center that they've got there. Since they own substantial chunks of New
                    Hampshire, they've got the facilities to do that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did that mean, “Outward Bound”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: It's survival courses; this Hurricane Island and experiential type of
                    things. It was winter camping for twenty-four days. Then living out in cabins in
                    the snow and doing stuff on experiential education groups and stress and all of
                    this. And then teaching a twenty-four day winter survival program. When we
                    taught it, it was with some people from the State University of New York at
                    Buffalo, and actually some New Hampshire high school kids, including a few
                    literally on parole out of the reform school. It was interesting because of all
                    of the college students, I got along best with the kids out of the reform
                    school, mostly because they were very similar to people I'd gone to high school
                    with. We could talk about cars and girls, and girls and cars.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>Then my senior year, I was an honors major. In the past you had had to stay on
                    campus, but they'd quietly changed the rules and about four of us figured that
                    out and realized we could do foreign study and still do this. They had a program
                    for African studies that was interesting, but it always cost more than the
                    normal term, and I was on financial aid. So I was over, at the beginning of my
                    senior year, looking at the bulletin board, and saw an ad for this, and this
                    short Senegalese guy came over and said, “Are you interested in this?” and I
                    said, “Yes, but I can't afford it.” It turns out that they had been running this
                    program with white professors and it was a black studies program - a pol/sci.
                    program. And they'd had huge problems with it and it was collapsing, so they had
                    dug up Aliun Endow, who had done Dartmouth undergraduate on an AID (Agency for
                    International Development) funded scholarship and was now at Harvard doing Ph.D.
                    work. He bargained and came back as associate professor in both political
                    science and black studies.</p>
                <p>Aliun is one of the most astute men that I've ever met in terms of politics.
                    Aliun bluntly decided that for the program to succeed, he needed a few whites,
                    and he was going to get them. So he basically said to me, “Well, if I could get
                    the money, would you be interested?” and I said, “Sure, but I doubt that you
                    can.” Two days later he had a $500 grant and a $200 loan, and I said, “Cool.” So
                    fall quarter I did that and then went to Sierra Leone for winter quarter and
                    then came back and graduated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about while you were taking, was it African studies
                        or black studies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Black studies, oh politically correct, black studies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Black studies, at that time, had sort of mixed reviews of
                        what was going on in the colleges at that time. What was your impression of
                        black studies, and maybe your colleagues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Mixed bag would probably characterize it. A lot of it depended on the
                    program and the particular professors. Insofar as you got something that was
                    closer to an international area studies course or something like that, it tended
                    to be more rigorous and more disciplined, and as I say, we tended to have fairly
                    good professors up there. So I think there was a little more credibility there,
                    although there was a bit of a feeling that it was somewhat above basket weaving,
                    but only just.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>It was interesting because I've had this discussion with college friends since
                    then; I think one of the great values of it, actually, was much more for the
                    white students. Insofar as it opened people's eyes to other parts of the world
                    or other aspects of America. That's all been to the good. I have a thirteen year
                    old and an eleven year old now; in February in Fairfax County is Black History
                    Month, and I find out that actually my kids are probably better prepared than
                    many. I think there was some legitimate criticism but it would be a shame to
                    throw out everything that was developed with the bathwater. I don't think you
                    can ignore a continent like Africa, nor do I think you can ignore the
                    African-American role in American history</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we move to Sierra Leone, were you able to tap into
                        sort of the international world; America's role in what was happening in the
                        world beyond the United States? Was this of particular interest to you, or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Oh sure, Vietnam was going on, which tended to dominate everything, but I
                    was taking a lot of international relations courses. I was interested in things.
                    At that time, one of Dartmouth's specialties, and it was the president then,
                    John Sloan Dickey, who was very interested in U.S.-Canada and that was about as
                    boring as vanilla ice cream. I think there was more of a push to understand that
                    there was a big world out there. I'd grown up in Europe, was interested in it,
                    so I certainly followed things. You know, the New York Times was up there and
                    any number of other things. It was probably an island in New Hampshire, but
                    nonetheless there were people interested in it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sierra Leone - you were there, it must be, '72 or so?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Yes, January to mid-March of 1972.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Sierra Leone like when you went there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Sierra Leone, in some ways, was actually a sweet little country. It had
                    its dictator there, but, you know, there wasn't really much going on. We showed
                    up with our group which had been split along racial lines, just because the
                    blacks were all hanging out with each other, and we got to Sierra Leone and
                    discovered a group that was virtually all-white from Kalamazoo College in
                    Michigan who'd been there for three months already. So they had figured out
                    where the beaches were, what you did, and all this and that. At first we were up
                    at the dorms at Fourah Bay College up on the mountain above Freetown, and it
                    became rapidly obvious to our black colleagues that it was really useful to have
                    a white with you in black Africa. People would stop when you were hitchhiking,
                    you got moved to the heads of the line; there was just a whole lot of leftovers
                    from colonialism still there.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>We ended up moving down the mountain and living with an African family on Lester
                    Road; Mrs. Wright and her sister had two houses near each other, so we were
                    split up. We were doing a lot of independent study and had weekly seminars and
                    then a number of us went up to an agricultural college at Njala for awhile, some
                    went up to Makeni. All names that became tragically familiar much later on. And
                    then you'd also go out to the beach. I mean, it was also the type of country,
                    even as a student, you had money. You know, the police down at the bottom of the
                    hill were selling marijuana for ten cents an ounce; the Kalamazoo people had
                    figured that out. You know, they had Star beer there, Lebanese restaurants, and
                    movies. So, it was nice.</p>
                <p>It was interesting. It was obviously a poorer country. Graham Greene had set his
                    first novel there. They had the Creoles, who had been the returned slaves. Just
                    an interesting place. I had gone there because in large part I figured, when
                    will I ever do Africa? So I mean, in that sense it was fascinating. Aliun was
                    out there and, frankly, he had his life, we had ours. He gave us a lot of
                    latitude - or we took it. But it was an interesting time; truly something I
                    would've never thought of doing.</p>
                <p>Foreign Service connection; that December, just before leaving, I had taken the
                    Foreign Service exam in the post office in Hanover, New Hampshire, because one
                    of my pol/sci professors had said, “Well, Mr. Tyson, you've taken every other
                    examination. Why don't you take the Foreign Service exam?” So, about three of us
                    did and I was the only one that passed the written portion. My roommate was
                    forwarding mail to Sierra Leone and I was at Njala Agricultural College in
                    Sierra Leone when I got a letter saying I'd passed the written test and could I
                    be in Boston in ten days for the orals. So I wrote back saying, “Love to do it,
                    but I'm in Africa. Can we reschedule?” I eventually got a letter back saying,
                    Washington, five days before you graduate from college, where I did pass the
                    orals. But, we went from Njala back to Freetown, so wearing my African sandals,
                    my shorts, my t-shirt, and my frizzy hair, I walked into the American Embassy
                    with my little letter and said, “I'd like to talk to someone about the Foreign
                    Service.” Incidentally, I can't remember the name of the man, he might have been
                    in consular or admin. [administration], but he brought me into his office, had a
                    pot of coffee and some cookies, and we sat around and talked about the Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You took the orals, this would've been in '72. Do you
                        recall the oral exam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Very much so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would like a sample of what sort of things were asked of
                        you.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>TYSON: My oral exam was interesting because it was headed by a young black
                    officer, Richard Moose, and then two older white guys in suits. One of them had
                    extensive experience in South America, I remember that. The other one I really
                    don't much remember. And I think it was very broadly questions of international
                    policy, a lot of sort of trivia, you know, do you know different parts of the
                    world. I remember the South America guy hammering me a bit on South America. But
                    what I think was most interesting about the interview was, of course, they all
                    had in front of them, I was just back from a foreign study program on Africa and
                    Moose, the black guy, looks at me and says, “Did you have racial problems in
                    your group?” and I looked at him and said, “Of course we did!” and you could
                    literally see the other two guys almost falling off their chairs, figuring, “Oh
                    my God, we're going to go there.” And you know, I basically said what I already
                    said, you know, in Hanover, New Hampshire you'd walk out of the classroom, the
                    eight blacks would go one way, the four whites the other. We meet in New York,
                    fly to London, have a twelve hour layover, go into London, the eight blacks go
                    one way, the four whites go another, and then we get to Africa where Aliun
                    actually broke us up in terms of roommates, and I got Mike Orr. But, it became
                    obvious to them that hanging out with the whites in Africa had its pluses. So we
                    talked a lot about it and Sierra Leone, and then I walked out, and they said,
                    “Well, you've passed.” So, that was fine. My memory of that was the question,
                    and just the looks on the faces of these guys, “Oh my God, he's going to go
                    there.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you passed this just before you graduated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Well, I had a low draft number and I had done the basic first two years of
                    ROTC, and if everything had been equal, I also had a deferred acceptance to the
                    Harvard Business School. I might've gone off and gotten a job and went and done
                    that, but the army was hanging over my head. I had no illusions that two years
                    as a private were going to do anything for me. I had already had eighteen years.
                    And so I decided, well, I'd been accepted to law school at GW (George
                    Washington) and USC; I'd go to law school at GW and eventually go in as a JAG
                    (Judge Advocate General) lawyer. So I started law school and started taking ROTC
                    at Georgetown, of all places, having to bicycle over there for that.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>Well, I had to go off for summer camp. This was, by now, 1973. The war in Vietnam
                    was winding down. I end up at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and suddenly they run
                    everybody through a physical and I had asthma when I was a kid, so they made me
                    go out and run, so I come back wheezing slightly, and this doctor puts me down
                    for further tests. It was really rather interesting. He had sort of curly hair
                    and like the granny glasses of that era and he was like four years ahead of me
                    at Dartmouth. So, fast forward, the army suddenly said after having passed any
                    number of physicals, “You fail. You're deferred.” And growing up around the
                    army, I went, okay, fine. Because I had kept the stuff on for the Foreign
                    Service; the security stuff, the medical, and everything else, all of a sudden I
                    realized, 'Oh my God, I could do the Foreign Service.' Sounded fine.</p>
                <p>So I called my mother from Fort Bragg and basically said, “Look, you handle the
                    old man. I do not want to walk into anything about what I've done or not done,
                    this is what's happened; it's all legit.” “So,” you know, “handle it before I
                    get there.” So my mother did. I came back for my second year of law school and
                    started working part-time at the American Gas Association, which becomes
                    important later on, and the Foreign Service basically said, “Well,” you know,
                    “you can come in.” And in that era they actually had a lot of jobs in Washington
                    that they wanted to fill. I said, “I'd really like to get one more semester
                    full-time and then switch to night school and be assigned to Washington.” So he
                    said, “Well, it's risky,” and all this and that, “but alright, we'll move you
                    onto the list.” So, I came into the Foreign Service in January of 1974 in the
                    111th Foreign Service class, and asked, at that point, to stay in
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you characterize your Foreign Service Class?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Any number of them have become friends since then. A mixed group with the
                    USIS (United States Information Service) people and all. I don't think we had
                    quite the age spread that came later on. There were five of us in there who were
                    under twenty-five, who were sort of somewhat jokingly known as “the babies”. I
                    was not quite twenty-four. And one of them, Donna Hrinak, is now our ambassador
                    in Venezuela, and so forth. So, a pretty congenial group though. Many of them
                    have remained my friends in this business and I'm still in touch with them. It's
                    one of those things that I think when you enter into it, you don't realize quite
                    how important it'll be to the rest of your career and how, in a way, you'll be
                    defined as part of this group, or “Oh, you were with so-and-so.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much of a mix of either race or gender, or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: It was just beginning. It was still a fairly heavily white male group, but
                    we had women, we had blacks, had Asian women. Theresa Chin Jones, her husband
                    was an FSO (Foreign Service Officer) and she came in. Terry became one of my
                    best friends. So, the mixing was definitely starting.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>Some of them were very, very uptight and stiff. You know, would wear a suit
                    everywhere. For others, it was a little looser because of just the era and the
                    times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the basic course?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: I was going to law school at night, so it was fine. I was not looking for
                    onerous burdens. Tell me what I need to do, I'll sit through it, I'd go through
                    it. I think a lot of it was more the acculturation, you know, how you deal with
                    the bureaucracy, how you do this and that. So in that sense, it was useful. It
                    was a little less important for me because I had a pretty good fix that I was
                    going to end up staying on in Washington. But, I guess the bottom line was, I
                    was happy with it because it wasn't overly onerous, because I had other things
                    that I was doing at night.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you married? Did you get married or anything like
                        that during this period, or were you single?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: I was single, but my subsequent first wife and I were pretty much of an
                    item in the argot of the day. Anne was with me a lot of the time. We were
                    defined as a couple from fairly early on. I had met her the previous summer,
                    after my first year of law school, at a wedding in Milwaukee. I'd been dating
                    someone else, actually, from GW. It was a very funny incident one evening when,
                    once again, my poor army father, the girl I was dating in New York called to
                    basically say she was taking up again with the guy that she had dated for a long
                    time in undergraduate school, which was something that I had sort of seen
                    coming. So, I get the phone call and my father asks what it was, and I tell him
                    and he's doing the “men commiserating with men”, you know, this, “You'll get
                    over it. Time will pass.” Well, half an hour later, Anne called; the girl that I
                    had just met in Milwaukee. I was over it perhaps even more rapidly than my
                    father had imagined. (laughs) She had just graduated from Smith and came down
                    here and started working, so from that point onward we were pretty much of an
                    item.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you concentrating on any area of law, or does one
                        just sort of get a law degree?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: You get a general law degree, but actually, at that point, the Department
                    was actually paying for some graduate studies and I got them to pay for certain
                    courses. So, you'd ask them to pay for International Law as opposed to
                    Constitutional Law or Administrative Law or, I think they even paid for Labor
                    Law which given the fact that I was involved in AFSA (American Foreign Service
                    Association) and later a chapter representative, I always found rather
                    amusing.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>I always found that eliminating that educational benefit down the line was a loss
                    for the Department, but at that point it was available, so. It didn't pay all of
                    the bills, but it paid for a course or two, so that was nice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in the Department? This would be
                        '74?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: This would be '74.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '74, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: I started out in the Office of Private Cooperation in the Bureau of
                    Cultural Affairs, which later?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What the hell is that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: CUPC. It ran a lot of programs like, oh, we funded or gave seed money
                    towards things like sister cities and international cooperation programs. I had
                    been assigned there; it was in SA-6 in Rosslyn, working for a guy named Mike
                    Johnson, who had been a political appointee in the White House and is now, I
                    think, with FMC Corporation in town. It was a lot of getting the private sector
                    involved and doing more with charity and leveraging stuff like this. You know,
                    in some ways it was a really nice first job for a junior officer.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Meanwhile, back at the ranch, I had mentioned Theresa Chin Jones, doing the
                    little exercises that one did in FSI (Foreign Service Institute) at that time,
                    they were trying to make things intensely relevant and I had worked part-time,
                    the fall before, for the American Gas Association in government relations, so I
                    knew a lot about energy. Terry Jones knew a lot about science and nuclear, so
                    when Terry and I were on the same team, we won. Terry, as I said, was married to
                    an FSO and she had been at lunch one day with a guy named Larry Raitch, who has
                    since passed on, a great guy; one of the best bosses I've ever had, who was
                    deputy director of the Office of Fuels and Energy in the EB [Economics] Bureau.
                    That's an office that had been headed by Jim Akins, and the energy crisis was in
                    full bore, blown open, and Larry was saying, “We need bodies, I need bodies,”
                    and Terry mentioned my name to him. I was, at that point, an O-8, and these were
                    O-4 jobs and I got this call saying, “Would you come over and talk to somebody
                    in this office?” So I went to Mr. Johnson and said, “I've gotten this call. I
                    want you to know about this.” He was a very astute man, so he said, “Go ahead
                    and take it.” So I went over there and there was a guy, sort of in corduroy
                    slacks and a sweater, named Steve Bosworth, later our ambassador to Tunisia and
                    Korea, and he just started chatting with me and then he handed me what was
                    obviously a draft memo to look at and it involved stuff like high pressure drill
                    pipe and all of this; for bizarre reasons at the American Gas Association, I had
                    actually worked on some of this. So I looked at the memo, took out a pen, and
                    said, “This won't happen technically, this won't happen politically.” So I got a
                    call about three days later and said, “Friday will be your last day. Monday
                    report to this office.” It turns out that Mike Johnson had been trying to get a
                    deputy director for a long, long time. So he basically traded the equivalent of
                    a second lieutenant for a lieutenant colonel and got his deputy director.</p>
                <p>But I ended up moving over to the Office of Fuels and Energy under Bosworth and
                    Raitch. Tom Andrews was the assistant secretary, and got very, very involved in
                    a lot of the energy issues. This is when they were setting up the International
                    Energy Agency (IEA) in Paris.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were doing this from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: '74 to '76. EBORFFSE, the Office of Fuels and Energies.</p>
                <p>I actually ended up getting the cats and dogs. The regular guys were traveling to
                    Paris to help set up the International Energy Agency, but I would get
                    inter-agency meetings, export controls, exotic energy, coal, natural gas,
                    electricity. But, as I say, I was a junior officer in a mid-level job, and the
                    office rapidly expanded. It's one of those, you know, hot offices, hot time,
                    most of the people who were there did fairly well coming out of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the, I mean, this was a time when there
                        were, well these were repercussions from the '73 war.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>TYSON: The oil embargo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What role did the State Department have in a lot of it? I
                        mean that you were seeing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: There was a lot of the negotiation for this International Energy Agency.
                    But we were also one of the major funnels for the reporting out of the oil
                    producing countries; obviously the Arab ones, the OPEC (Organization of
                    Petroleum Exporting Countries) ones, but also Norway and others. I mean, this
                    was really a lot of oil-as-politics coming out. It was also a time when there
                    was the oil for wheat program and a lot of screaming about things up on the Hill
                    (Capitol Hill). The number of congressional inquiries we did was phenomenal.
                    Later on in my career I'd see people freaking; I used to have fifteen of them on
                    my desk. I was put in charge of basically updating the generic paragraphs. I'd
                    literally read something and do, you know, A-F-G-S, these paragraphs, that's the
                    letter, put it up, and the secretaries would handle it.</p>
                <p>It was an interesting time. I think we were trying to get more production in the
                    U.S. and basically decide how to respond to really a major shift in power, which
                    of course was not only in terms of oil, but the finances. The flow of money was
                    just phenomenal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had two, Bosworth and then Andrews?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: No, Bosworth headed the office and Andrews was the assistant
                    secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was sort of breathing down your shoulder? I mean, were
                        you involved with both of them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: I had very little to do with them. I really had a lot more to do with
                    Larry Raitch because Andrews and Bosworth were very concerned with the
                    negotiations of the IEA in Paris. So Raitch tended to be like the DCM (Deputy
                    Chief of Mission) and was much more the office manager, so if there was a
                    Commerce Department meeting, there was a State Department rep. on this or that,
                    he was running me much more than Bosworth was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the relations - I mean, this would be,
                        you're sort of the new boy on the block watching the Department respond. How
                        did the State Department respond, say, with Commerce?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>TYSON: I think it was an interesting insight. It depended. If it were a new
                    committee being formed, all bets are off and you see the dynamics evolve. If
                    you're the State Department rep. walking into something that's been established,
                    particularly with people from other agencies who've been doing this committee
                    work for six, eight, ten years, you know, you're the new FSO that they need to
                    reeducate. At that point, if you're very young on top of it, it's “Oh my God,
                    he's even wet behind the ears, too.”</p>
                <p>By and large, they were wonderfully supportive. The good thing about Fuels and
                    Energy was that they were so damn busy that they didn't have time to get upset
                    about you. There was a Japanese group that came through and the office was asked
                    to speak and it was a lot on exotics and the future and it was what I did. I
                    went with some guys from OES [Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental
                    and Scientific Affairs] and INR [Bureau of Intelligence and Research], and
                    before I even spoke - we had discussed this - they introduced me and explained
                    why I was so young, but why I was nonetheless so important to a Japanese group.
                    It was great training, great background for that. There was a certain amount of
                    jockeying, but the Federal Energy Agency, or what became the Energy Department
                    at that point, was a lot of new, young people. It wasn't so much the
                    inter-agency things where you've got the rivalry. It was someone who's been in
                    the oil industry, who's forty or fiftyish, who's been on drill platforms, who's
                    been on this or that, and all of a sudden sees these young policy wonks coming
                    in, doing international energy. That was where you got a lot of the feathers up,
                    hurt feelings type of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for the European response to the
                        problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Very much so. We were getting a lot of the cables in about the
                    International Energy Agency, and I mean, this was when France basically made the
                    option to go nuclear on electricity and were also trying to cut special deals
                    and arrangements with some of the Arab and other countries. I suspect if you
                    look at some of the scandals involving the French oil companies today, you could
                    trace it back to actions taken in this era. The Germans were beginning to look
                    at more nuclear electricity and any number of other things. The Brits were
                    rather different. The Japanese were in a dead panic; you know, what were they
                    going to do? It was an interesting time to see how people chose to respond.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were we responding at that time to nuclear energy?
                        What was the mindset of that tune?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>TYSON: We were going forward with it. Three-Mile Island had not yet occurred, so
                    it was clear that there were siting and financing and other problems with it,
                    and deep in the future, probably a waste disposal problem, but to one looking at
                    a national energy strategy, nuclear had to be part of it. I think even at that
                    point, coal or coal usage in one form was clearly a solution for the U.S.,
                    perhaps more of an option than other countries had since we've got vast amounts
                    of it. But the other twist with the U.S. was always, of course, liquid
                    transportation fuels, which tends to get you back to oil. I mean, our level of
                    usage of liquid transportation fuels was considerable. So each country had a
                    slightly different dynamic on that in trying to fit it all together and to the
                    industrialized world as a whole it was a great deal of the challenge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Canada and its water resources play a role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: It wasn't water resources; it was much more Alberta, the blue-eyed Arabs
                    of the north, as the major oil producing province which obviously saw itself
                    gaining from increased revenues, and, you know, the federal provincial rivalry
                    is the federal government's looking at an energy deficit east, with an energy
                    surplus west, and how you handle that. Canadians were always interesting on
                    that. Electricity and looking at hydro out of Quebec and stuff like that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling, being in the EB Bureau at that
                        time, that it was riding fairly high within the Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Oh, yes. It was riding fairly high and Frances Wilson?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to ask you, because she's a name that resounds
                        anybody who dealt with EB.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Yes, Frances Wilson, I mean queen of EB assignments. You did not piss
                    Frances off if you wanted a career in that bureau. She was one of those legends
                    that, you know, knew people who made things happen, and insofar as the
                    geographic bureaus, there are certain countries that have clubs. If there was an
                    EB club, she was absolutely intricate to it.</p>
                <p>I knew her slightly - managed to stay on her good side. I think she certainly
                    didn't hurt me and probably helped me a little bit in terms of my first
                    assignment to Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was a civil servant who sort of lived for this, and
                        had her courtiers and cadre which she saw did well and all, and really was,
                        from all accounts - I've never served in EB - a very positive influence.
                        Particularly in an organization that normally was not very enthusiastic
                        about economists.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>TYSON: I think that's true. You didn't want to get on her bad side. I think one
                    of the staff aides, I've forgotten who it was, had been less than deferential to
                    her at one point and she saw that she got him. Of course, she had the ear of the
                    principals within the bureau and dealt with the assignments bureaucracy and knew
                    how to do it. Actually, once again my father being a sergeant, you know, you
                    don't piss off the supply sergeants and the staff, but if you do when you're a
                    young first or second lieutenant, they will get you.</p>
                <p>One or two of my friends, I think she really liked and probably helped out. You
                    probably at some point want to ask Brian Mueller, who's now head of the Japan
                    Desk, about her. Frances was quite a player and I think clearly, in my view, EB
                    declined when she left, as far as that goes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find at that time that the geographic bureaus did
                        play much of a role, or not? In matters of what you were dealing with -
                        energy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: The geographic bureaus or particular desks did. The NEA Bureau, obviously
                    on the Arabs and oil, was a seriously big player, particularly the Arabian
                    Peninsula Affairs Division. The Japan Desk always had things to say about
                    anything involving the Japanese. Others, EUR (Europe), probably less so because
                    it was a broader slate of things. The ones who would get involved in that was
                    more the regional political economic office where I later served. I would say
                    the Gulf States and people like the Japan Desk were definite players. I mean,
                    you made damn sure you cleared your stuff with them. You might butt heads on
                    this or that, but they had an oar in the water.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get your law degree?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: I got my law degree. I graduated in '75 about four months later than I
                    would have, had I done it full-time, and took the Virginia Bar. And at that
                    point was getting ready to be assigned overseas and obviously with a lot of oil
                    background, I remember one of the personnel counselors saying, “What would you
                    think about Abu Dhabi?” and I said, “Fine, but I'm going to be bringing in
                    Passover supplies.” He looked and said, “What would you think about Germany?”
                    and I said, “Fine, I grew up there,” and my language background was German, so
                    that was fine.</p>
                <p>I was supposed to go into an EB job there, but the guy I was replacing managed to
                    stay on. He was much favored with the economic counselor's wife, and suddenly I
                    found myself in a rotational job, which actually was fine, but I hadn't had the
                    consular training for it. But Bonn was a bit of a country club. The new voting
                    rights act had just come in then, so the consul, John Buche, who is a wonderful
                    man to work for, sort of took me and had me doing a lot of the voting rights
                    stuff because I was a lawyer.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>I did six weeks in the consulate and then ended up moving up to the science
                    section because there was a very big issue involving (by this time Carter was
                    president, or was about to be) the German's selling the complete nuclear fuel
                    cycle to Brazil, which at some point would've permitted the Brazilians to build
                    a bomb. So suddenly Warren Christopher, the deputy secretary, and others, are
                    greatly seized with this issue. I was sent up to work for the science counselor,
                    Clyde McClelland. There was one of these old Foreign Service secretaries, who
                    was ageless even then, Liz Gray, who just looked at me and said, “I'm getting
                    tired of taking care of wet-behind-the-ear junior officers.” I remember that.
                    Actually because of the work that I had been doing in fuels and energy which
                    included nuclear, I actually knew a hell of a lot more about nuclear. I was to
                    be there for three months, which became four months, which became six months,
                    which became nine months because Clyde kept going up to the DCM and saying, “For
                    the first time in my career I actually have a junior officer who can back me up
                    and you can't take him away now.” So they, I think sensibly, agreed. It was
                    fascinating work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the issue from our perspective in Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Non-proliferation. If the Germans sold the whole cycle to the Brazilians,
                    eventually they would be able to much more easily build a bomb and we were
                    concerned about Argentina getting a bomb, Brazil getting a bomb.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That thing lasted for about twenty years, I think, as far
                        as the issue; both sides sort of jockeying it. It didn't make sense for
                        either one of them to produce it, but it was just they kept getting closer
                        and closer, I guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: I think there was a lot of that. I mean, this was probably related to
                    Vietnam and everything else. The Germans basically jabbing us in the eye as a
                    sovereign country, too. They knew that we were upset, but in a sense they were
                    going to do it anyways.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your role?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>TYSON: I backed up McClelland and at that point we were getting a lot of visitors
                    through. It turned out, specifically on this, fairly early on after the Carter
                    administration came in; Warren Christopher came out to head the U.S. team on it.
                    I was the duty officer and I had a great vignette of delivering a telegram to
                    Warren Christopher in his pajamas at midnight; absolutely a real gentleman. His
                    first response was, “Tell me it's not 7:00A.M.,” and I said, “It's not 7:00A.M.,
                    but I need to show this to you.” So he was at one of the hotels in Bonn and so I
                    got back in my car, I drove back out and dropped the stuff off and did that. It
                    was a lot of “Visits are Us”; these teams are coming over, you're doing that.
                    And because science was so broadly undefined, energy was so important, and the
                    environment was coming along, we had a huge number of visitors. I did a lot of
                    visitors, with Dr. McClelland and all. But the Germany-Brazil nuclear deal was
                    dominating a lot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were we saying to the Germans and what were the
                        Germans saying to us on this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: We were saying to the Germans that we don't want you to do this for the
                    following reasons, and they were saying, “Oh don't worry, it probably won't
                    happen, and if it does happen, it'll happen way off in the future.” There was a
                    serious disconnect there. Germany, at this point, also was looking at using this
                    to leverage commercial and political advantage in Brazil, which even then was
                    seen as a comer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we just sort of saying what we were saying; I mean,
                        was there any coercion or sort of plus side to it, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: I think the fact that we sent the deputy secretary of state gave an idea
                    of how important it was, and it was the type of things that in high level
                    meetings there was often a talking point. Much more Draconian stuff; I think
                    we'd have to wait for stuff to be declassified. I think at various points we
                    didn't make our views known, but that's one that I think the records will have
                    to speak to it down the line.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the French a player in this at all? Was this strictly
                        a German thing or were the French involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: I think part of the German concern, and one of the reasons they were doing
                    it, was that they could tell us no and if the Germans gave in their view was the
                    French would step in. The French were sort of seen as the whores of the universe
                    or something like that. As I said, in terms of individual deals with countries
                    looking to make their own arrangements. Not particularly popular, and yet on the
                    other side, you've got the French-German axis which underpins the European
                    community. They had their political pressures, too.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for the German foreign office and how
                        they operated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Yes, I did. My better feel for it came much later on in the tour when I
                    was actually in the political section in the labor office, in dealing a lot with
                    the trade unions and the people in the party organizations, the SPD (Social
                    Democratic Party) organization, doing the trade unions because they had much
                    better political information than the foreign office did. They were much more
                    tied in to the political leadership.</p>
                <p>The German Foreign Office was pretty good. Their science people were very good,
                    had good cooperative arrangements with the other science ministries. It was
                    really much later on when somebody in the SPD party structure and it was an SPD
                    government, just knew more.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there during the neutron bomb business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: No, that came later on, but what I was there for the first contacts with
                    what became the Green Party; I did them. I was twenty-six, the assistant labor
                    attach�. As I said, I'd taken Labor Law and was working for the labor attach�.
                    Yes, there were interesting things in what the Germans were doing, but one of my
                    adjunct things was to start meeting with what were then the people in the
                    Berliner Initiative or the citizen's initiatives groups, which was the beginning
                    of the anti-nuclear groups.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Petra Kelley in this group, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: She was just starting to come in on the fringes and I later met her in the
                    summer of '83. But it was even lower level, more diffuse at that. I knew an
                    American woman who was over there working on some projects and she had some
                    contacts there, and Dick Smyser, the political minister, was interested in
                    starting to see where they were going. In a way, I fit the profile. I remember
                    him, as I'm running around in my madras shirt, my leather sport coat, and my
                    blue jeans, saying, “Please don't get arrested.” (laughs)</p>
                <p>But I mean, I did some of the initial reporting on that and it was the
                    anti-nuclear groups in Badenburg, I talked to a guy in West Berlin who later
                    became a member of parliament under the Green List. Stuff like that. I mean it
                    was clear that you dismissed these people at your peril. You know, junior
                    officer, you're out on the street, you're hanging out, you're writing stuff that
                    people are reading. It was fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the anti-nuclear then pointed strictly at weapons or
                        was it also moving towards the environmental?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>TYSON: It was pointed a bit at weapons, but it was really much more focused on
                    proposed power plants. There was one in Badenburg and Whyl that got a lot of
                    opposition and then nuclear reprocessing and disposal sites and stuff. I think
                    later on as the cruise missiles, actually the neutron bomb did start then, and
                    yes, there was more of a cross-over. But a lot of this had basis in local groups
                    driven by, “not in my backyard” opposition. And in a densely populated country
                    like Germany, that resonated even more.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were working sort of on the labor side in SPD,
                        what was your impression of the SPD people you were meeting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: By and large, my impression of the SPD people was pretty good. I still
                    have some friends involved in it. It was interesting. It was a bit more of the
                    newer generation. I mean, the older generation had gone through the streets,
                    fights with the Nazis and the Communists. This was more upscale. This was the
                    SPD in suits. This was much more of, if you will, a Tony Blair type of thing.
                    They cleaned up well. They had their political viewpoints, but also it was a
                    wealthier country; it was a country that was much more powerful in Europe. They
                    were playing more of a role.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that sort of the older people in our embassy
                        were having trouble sort of adjusting to the new SPD as opposed to, you
                        know, the old time, as with the Labor Party in Britain, you know a bunch of
                        people got around and saying they're a red flag forever and used a lot of
                        the rhetoric of the '30s. You were seeing the change, but was this change
                        becoming apparent within the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Oh, yes, I think Dick Smyser was an extraordinarily astute political
                    counselor and he had a lot of political contacts in the party and used to meet
                    with them regularly on a one-on-one basis. Rick Large, Willy Brandt, others - we
                    dealt with them. There wasn't that type of feeling. You'd get some of the older
                    guys further down in the organization, you know, “the red flag” or, you know,
                    “Hamburg is red”, or something like this, but the leadership at that point,
                    after the grand coalitions in the '60s; the Godesburg Accord, there was a
                    “regiom sayeg” literally capable of governing. The SPD had fought hard to get
                    that perception amongst the German public and they were not particularly going
                    to let go of it lightly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Helmut Schmidt on the scene at that point or was
                        he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Helmut Schmidt was the chancellor at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Chancellor. Later, the relations between Jimmy Carter and
                        Helmut Schmidt were poisonous, particularly over the neutron bomb, but even
                        before that. Did you get any feeling for this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: That was the beginning of Carter being seen as something of a weaker
                    president. Schmidt was quite a personality; a dominating personality; one of the
                    truly magnetic men. You know, you're in a room and he walked in with that
                    Leonine hair and just those good looks and, I mean, you knew he was there, you
                    knew he was the chancellor. Interestingly enough, he was shorter than I would've
                    expected.</p>
                <p>I think he found Carter and the administration weak and vacillating. There had
                    also been, I think, a famous quote by one of the more leftist in the SPD that
                    the neutron bomb was the perfect capitalist weapon; it destroyed people and not
                    property. And boy that was a statement that really resonated through Germany and
                    the north German plain.</p>
                <p>I think Carter, in his own way, and history is treating him much kinder, had a
                    lot of the right instincts, but in some ways he had some amateurs, really,
                    running the business. They didn't understand it, and I think he felt that if he,
                    in a southern fashion, and I can understand, that if he just sat on the porch
                    and visited with someone, it would be right. It wouldn't be right with someone
                    like Schmidt who's a serious player politically in Europe and on the world
                    stage. I think there had been something in the '76 election that it had been
                    sort of leaked that actually even the SPD had sort of preferred to see the
                    Republicans in. So I think there was a little bit on our side, or some of the
                    Carter people, about that. The other thing is people forget Carter and others
                    coming from Georgia, and the difference between Carter coming from a state like
                    Georgia and Reagan coming from a state like California was night and day. You
                    know, the Carter people just couldn't believe that houses cost as much as they
                    did in Washington. Some of the people, obviously, were pretty savvy, others just
                    weren't. It was, you know, “Guys, this is the big league.” I think Carter, in a
                    sense, and this is something that I later saw when I came back and I was a staff
                    aide, was too seized with the minutiae. You're the president, let others take
                    care of this. He'd start getting down into the weeds on different memos and
                    stuff that the President of the United States does not need to do that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TYSON: I left in '78.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '78, I mean. And you had quite a good rotation then,

                </p>
                <p>TYSON: I can go into that in the next session because there was actually some
                    more there.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you name these things and we'll put it on in that
                        session.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Sure, I was in the consular affairs section, I was in the science office
                    for nine months, then I actually did a special project for the admin. Counselor,
                    Earl Ballinger, and then I was the assistant labor attach� and I did the
                    citizen's initiatives and I also did a series of six reports on the foreign
                    workers in Germany; the Gastarbeiter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Alright, well we'll cover those the next time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Paul, you were still in Bonn, right?</p>
                <p>TYSON: Actually, if I could, what I'd like to do is go back and catch up on some
                    stuff that you said I could do from the previous things.</p>
                <p>One of the things from my time in the Economics Bureau of the Office of Fuels and
                    Energy that came up that was interesting was the assistant secretary was Tom
                    Enders and later went on to become an ambassador and I think he's deceased now,
                    but during that period there was perhaps the most devastating piece on an
                    ambassador's wife done that I've ever seen and it was Sally Quinn writing on
                    Gaetana Enders and, frankly, Gaetana did it to herself. It was quite
                    interesting, came in, and it was, of course, all over the bureau. I think they
                    were trying to suppress it, but for heaven's sakes it's in the style section of
                    the Washington Post; I think the paper was sold out in the building. I
                    understand that Mr. Enders had to do some letters of apology to a number of the
                    senators named in the article.</p>
                <p>It was very interesting about Gaetana because the word on her on the street was
                    that when she was back home in Italy, she was always the American ambassador's
                    wife, but when she was in America, of course she was the Italian contessa. But
                    it was an interesting period of time in the office I was in. Produced a number
                    of ambassadors out of thaPaul Taylor and Glen Rase, and of course, Steve
                    Bosworth.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>The other thing that I wanted to talk about, actually, was FSI language training.
                    It was sort of interesting. I had had some German so I came in after the course
                    had already started, which probably was not the best idea given because you're
                    like a little dressage pony; you learn various dialogues and so forth. But the
                    teacher that I always remember was Margarite Plishka, and she is the one who had
                    basically coached President Kennedy for the “Ich bin ein Berliner” phrase, you
                    know, the famous “I'm a jelly donut” phrase. But she had some very, very nice
                    things to say about Kennedy and I guess he'd given her a signed book. But she
                    was one of those post-war �migr�s where I think at some point one of the photo
                    magazines or a magazine in Germany had done something on her life in the States,
                    and apparently she got some fairly hateful letters from the old country about
                    abandoning the Fatherland and so forth. She was a wonderful teacher, but I
                    remember we had this one dreadful wife, who shall remain unnamed, in my
                    immediate section, who wanted to finish all twenty-four chapters, and the
                    teachers were saying, “Well, you don't do that. You reach a certain level, we
                    switch to newspapers, we do movies and stuff like that.” The best quote that I
                    ever got out of one of the teacherI don't know whether it was Frau Plishka - was
                    that the frustration of teaching languages at FSI was that FSOs are very, very
                    verbal, and under the best of circumstances you'd come out of the program
                    sounding like an intelligent twelve-year-old, which frustrates a lot of
                    FSOs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had Frau Plishka, too. She's very good.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: She was very, very good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well let's go to Bonn then. We've talked about some things
                        in Bonn. In consular affairs, was there anything of note that you were doing
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Consular affairs was sort of interesting because I had no training for it,
                    but in 1976 the Overseas Voting Act had come in and I'd mentioned that I ended
                    up rotating down there; working for John Buche who is a lovely man to work for
                    and just a truly humanitarian man and did a lot of outreach and American Citizen
                    Services work. But he quite sensibly said, “Well, I've got a newly minted lawyer
                    here. You take it over and do it.” So I was doing a lot of the paperwork on that
                    and some standard consular things. Bonn, in a sense, was a real country club of
                    the system. You have basically affluent Germans going to the States. During that
                    period, the embassy looked out for people with Nazi or concentration camp
                    records, or in the younger set, the Bader Meinhof types.</p>
                <p>There were about five junior officers there and John ended up using two of us, me
                    and David Straub, because we took an extremely liberal viewpoint on unmarried
                    German couples traveling to the U.S. together. My attitude, having done the
                    Eurail pass myself, was “Have a great time. Tell me if you're going to Mexico;
                    I'll give you the multiple visas.” So that, by and large, was fine. Your
                    problems came with the third-country nationals.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>The other thing that was interesting was you had to go out and work the line if
                    you had American citizen indigents, because our German employees just really
                    hated them and were more than borderline rude to them. So you needed an American
                    to handle it. The one thing we had going for us in Bonn was an arrangement with
                    the “caritasheim” downtown, and the Sisters were much stricter than we ever
                    could have been. And in that era, it was the '70s and we were sort of the
                    beginning stop on the trek to Nepal so some of the ones fell out on our
                    doorstep. You got some real hustlers, but every now and then you just got that
                    incredibly sweet, dumb American kid that all you could do was say, “It'll be
                    alright. We'll help out,” and we would. But we also had an ACS case involving a
                    naturalized American German-Jewish?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ACS being?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: American Citizen Services.</p>
                <p>John and I ended up working a great deal on that, but the man eventually
                    died.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: He was just an older man in his eighties or nineties and he was in a care
                    facility in Germany, and we would call in on him and just check and see that he
                    was okay, but John really went above and beyond on that. It was about an hour
                    ride down the river to the place where he was, the people were terribly nice to
                    him and it was all fine, but John would take me along and we would go and do
                    that. I was there full-time for about two months, and then periodically when
                    John was away, as I said, because of my liberal viewpoint on visas, I often
                    ended up covering for him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you explain what the problem was in the liberal versus
                        non-liberal points-of-view?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Three or four junior officers were devout Catholics and wouldn't issue
                    visas to unmarried couples traveling together to the States. I did. (laughs)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: (laughs) Oh John.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: I mean, the unspoken things in the Foreign Service. I wasn't a consular
                    officer, but, you know, John had a problem and David Straub and I would run the
                    visa section in the fashion that he would like it.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know when I was a line consular officer, we used to
                        rotate cases of this nature, that certain people we'd make sure didn't
                        interview them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any problem with the Overseas Voters Act?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Some of the state paperwork, particularly from the smaller states wasn't
                    particularly good or clear. But one of the things that was amazing about the
                    consulate in Bonn is they had saved every rubber stamp that had ever been
                    utilized in the universe, so when in doubt we just threw more stamps on the
                    paperwork, and at the end of the day it all seemed to work.</p>
                <p>The other thing that was interesting about the consulate, from a lawyer's
                    viewpoint, was some of the notarials; notarials involving trusts and estates
                    cases. Aunt Hilda had gone off to marry Uncle Fritz in St. Louis, they never had
                    kids, he died, you know, in the late '40s or something like that, she stayed on
                    and there's a distribution of an estate. All very straightforward, but just
                    reading some of the documents out of Missouri or Wisconsin or so forth reveal
                    some life sagas in immigration stories. Germans were always terribly nice about
                    it. The biggest problem that we had was that occasionally just doing a straight
                    notarial, it just wasn't impressive enough for some of them, so we always had
                    the ribbon and the foil there. We got an older German who really wanted it and
                    it was a slow afternoon, we'd put the ribbon and the foil on everything and that
                    seemed to make them feel better.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. You know I've made a certain number of
                        equivalents in non-documents. “This is to certify that the American Embassy
                        cannot do such-and-so,” and it was a big seal and it usually got them
                        through whatever they had to do. (laughs)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Well it was very interesting with particularly some of the older Germans.
                    Bonn was the type of place where periodically you just had strange things coming
                    up. I remember one day later on in my tour my boss and I were suddenly tasked
                    with representing the embassy at the anniversary of the capture of the Ludendorf
                    Bridge in Remagen. And you know, like, “We're going down there, and they're
                    happy to see us?” “Oh, yeah, yeah, go on down. Have a great time.”</p>
                <p>The other thing that was always interesting was the ex-prisoners of war
                    associations used to ask for embassy representatives and since I spoke German
                    I'd go. I figure in the grand scheme of things they must've done something right
                    in that these people were still asking us back and actually had fond memories of
                    being an eighteen-year-old POW (Prisoner of War) in Colorado or something.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, you know, in the middle of Arkansas. It was the
                        damnedest thing. You could probably tell them where they've been and places
                        they've made a studious effort to avoid.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Then you get down to labor attach�.</p>
                <p>TYSON: First I was the assistant science counseloI think we went through a bit of
                    that on the Germany-Brazil nuclear deal. But I ended up there for nine months
                    under Clyde McClelland and then Earl Ballinger was the administrative minister
                    and he actually gave me a very interesting study. He gave me all the personnel
                    records and a lot of history and the question was basically, “Which of the
                    various institutions left over from the occupation and elsewhere were sort of
                    under embassy authority as opposed to U.S. army Europe or the military
                    authorities?” and you ended up with a lot of the cats and dogthe document
                    centers in Berlin and stuff like this. It was really pretty interesting and
                    pretty much left me to myself. I went through a whole lot of things and I ended
                    up giving it to him, but I think it probably in many ways was a predecessor to
                    what later became ICASS [International Cooperative Administrative Support
                    Services]; that the embassy was carrying a lot of stuff and not really getting a
                    lot of recompense for it. But I did that for two months and then there were two
                    junior officer jobs open; one was with the Bonn group, which in spite of the
                    name, did the status of Berlin - and David Straub went to that, and I was the
                    acting and then the assistant labor attach�. Herb Baker was there just at the
                    beginning of my tour, and then Roger Schrader. But I also had two special
                    projects from Dick Smyser, the political minister, and one was on the foreign
                    workers in Germany. I did six reports on that and then the other was basically
                    political reporting on what was in the citizen initiatives groups, which later
                    became the Green Party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk first about the Gastarbeiters. What was your
                        impression of how the system was working and the future of these people;
                        where they were from and how they were moving within German society at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: At that time, there was an innate hypocrisy or something ostrich-like
                    about the German views. First of all, with the Gastarbeiter there were
                    differences. The Italians, which had been the first group, were EU (European
                    Union) members, so they were going to have the right?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn't EU at the time though.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: It was the Common Market.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Common Market, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>TYSON: They had the right to labor mobility. So if the Italians wanted to be in
                    Germany, they could be in Germany and that was going to be fine. The Spanish and
                    Portuguese had not yet acceded to it and there was going to be a transition
                    period on labor mobility the nuances of which were already being negotiated. The
                    Yugoslavs, interestingly enough, had a very small number, but they tended to be
                    technicians and they had been there for a while and surprisingly weren't that
                    much of a problem. The Greeks also were looking at future accession and much
                    like the Spanish and Portuguese, it was when, where, and how it would go. The
                    big monolith that everybody just couldn't really deal with, and it persists
                    today, is Turkey. Now, in a sense, what was interesting, and I basically went
                    around to the labor attaches in the other embassies, there was a surprising
                    degree of candor of one foreigner talking to another foreigner about the Germans
                    and it wasn't always pretty.</p>
                <p>As I say, the Italians were much further along, but the others found a lot of
                    discrimination, a certain amount of xenophobia among the Germans. I think the
                    German trade unions were trying to organize these workers with some success, but
                    the idea that they'd happily work for twenty years and then go back home, I
                    think, was unrealistic from the get-go, particularly when you started looking at
                    a second and even a third generation; you know some young Turkish woman, or boy
                    who's been born in Kreuzberg, in Berlin, grows up there, and you know, Mommy and
                    Daddy are going on about the beauties of the Anatolian highlands and they go
                    back and find two squalid rooms on rocky soil and they just sort of look and
                    figure, “I'm out of here.”</p>
                <p>There's one of those instances where I talked with the smarter Germans, and I
                    also talked to people in the political foundations, the Ebert Stiftung, the
                    Adenauer Stiftung, and others, about the problems and said, “You know, we've
                    done emigration, we've done immigration. The classic novels in America are the
                    immigrant's dilemma. We know a lot about this. Trust me. Here's what you need to
                    do with schooling the kids and all.” And in a sense, the Germans heard it, but
                    didn't want to hear it. It was fascinating to see.</p>
                <p>The oil crisis had already occurred and they had really shut off the recruitment
                    of new workers. So if you were in under the wire, you had something. The other
                    law stipulated that if you had been there for five years you could stay. So
                    basically by 1978 the ones who were there had the right to stay. Now there were
                    problems with their kids coming, the children having the right to work, and any
                    number of other things. But a lot of it had been done. You got a lot of
                    professors and others saying, “Well the Germans can just turf two million people
                    out.” Well under their own regulations by 1978 that was really not an
                    option.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what about the factories? I mean, had they developed
                        a cadre of Gastarbeiters that they really couldn't lose? It wasn't as though
                        there were Germans queued up ready to take those jobs, weren't they?
                        Germany's major concentration in many ways was producing quality goods.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>TYSON: Well, factories, also the food service industries, some of the hotels,
                    they concentrated in key areas. As I said with the Yugoslavs, different
                    nationalities also tended to concentrate in different areas. But no, by this
                    point, the Germans needed the labor and the people, it isn't always the case,
                    the smarter ones, the more talented ones, the more verbally-gifted, were
                    starting to move up and become more keen in organizations. So I think it's
                    probably like immigration in the States. In the abstract, “throw them all out”,
                    but then, you know, “my guy,” or “the woman on the line,” or “we know her; she's
                    so good,” it's always the individual was the exception.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your contacts with the Citizen's Initiative
                        which blossomed into the Green Movement? What was your impression at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: They were absolutely fascinating from a political viewpoint. First of all,
                    a friend of mine, an American woman named Cynthia Whitehead, was sort of hanging
                    out in Europe and involved in some things and doing some freelance newspaper
                    things. I knew her because we were sort of the same age and we were blossoming
                    out beyond the embassy set. So my first wife and I had American friends who were
                    in Europe for one reason or another, and Cynthia was incredible in making some
                    of the initial introductions. She had interviewed these people or had been at
                    conferences with them and saw all this as mostly an anti-nuclear initiative, but
                    it was more than just that. So when I needed some initial introductions, it was
                    Cynthia's, “Yes, you really do want to meet with him,” that got me the initial
                    meetings. But these tended to be local groups that would call us about issues;
                    the big ones were opposition to a proposed nuclear plant, but there would be
                    other things; opposition to a road or a factory or the fact that the social
                    services or infrastructure provided to a poorer section of town was less than it
                    should be. And there was a really conscious viewpoint not to create a national
                    organization. It was much more decentralized, very local, no real leadership
                    stars, everybody's equal; let's sort of hang out and sort of coalesce and make
                    our decisions and coordinate that way. And it frustrated a lot of your typical
                    analysts looking at Germany. You know, here's the wiring diagram, here's who
                    this is, here's who's that. You get some German grandmother out of upper Bavaria
                    or something like that who's never been politically active in her life, who took
                    on a cause and all of a sudden she's sitting at the high table when these groups
                    meet. It was frustrating for even the German officialdom trying to get a grip on
                    this. I think the Greens and the Citizens Initiatives knew this and would very
                    consciously change spokesmen, change leaders. Someone would be on the dais and
                    then they'd go away and then someone else would come, then the first one would
                    come back. But there were different groups, and even at that point the real
                    leaders were emerging.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>I did not meet Petra Kelly in this period, but I heard her name mentioned. And
                    there was the evolution of this and I honestly think that we did, me and the
                    political section, some of the best initial, and probably historical, reporting
                    on the genesis of the Green Party. I went out to Berlin and met with someone who
                    later became a member of parliament on the Green list, but a lot of his issues
                    were providing more social services in a poor neighborhood in Berlin, as opposed
                    to the anti-nuclear thing. But fascinating people. Some were incredibly
                    politically committed, others who had just sort of gotten a burr under their
                    saddle and suddenly found themselves in politics.</p>
                <p>This also led to another point, going back to FSI language training. They had
                    refused or basically said, “We're not teaching you the 'du,' the German
                    informal, because in two years in Germany you'll never get close enough to a
                    German to do this.” Nothing could have been further from the truth. Anybody in
                    their twenties, you're at a party together, you're drinking or something, it
                    goes to 'du.' I mean, I used to basically say to close German friends later on
                    in the evening that, “If I slip into 'sie' it's not an insult. I've just been
                    taught that with certain phrases, so ignore me.” With the labor unions,
                    including being a foreign embassy representative to labor union functions,
                    you're all part of the group, therefore you use the informal with each other.
                    The same was true, actually, within the ranks of the SPD. So you'd go to certain
                    labor union SPD functions and you had to know the informal German.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know, I went through the process and it's very hard,
                        having been trained in the formal, to move to the familiar. I mean, you're
                        gritting your teeth at having to remember this all the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Well, you know, they've trained you for the court of the kaiser and there
                    you are with a bunch of trade unionists on the Hamburg dock going, “Ah, yes,
                    what is that verb again?” (laughs)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the German political
                        situation, particularly where the parties really have real control over
                        things? Because they have the lists and they rank people on the lists and so
                        there isn't this sort of somebody making a name for themselves by really
                        doing constituent service in a particular place and winning a certain amount
                        of independence in the party.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>TYSON: I think that, in many ways, is ultimately what led to the rise of the
                    Green Party. I think the grand coalition in the '60s had precluded a lot of the
                    elbowing and political jockeying that had happened later. I never knew these
                    people. My friend Cynthia that I had mentioned, had discussed groups that had
                    called themselves the “Ausserpavlamenadrischeopposition,” the Extra
                    Parliamentary Opposition, when they found that there were no channels within the
                    SPD for them and others. And I think this disaffection with Germany
                    Incorporated, and the existing political structure, is what turned a lot of
                    people off and led them to turn to groups like the Citizen's Initiatives and
                    eventually the Green Party. The ossified and stratified existing bureaucratic
                    structures frustrated a lot of the younger people. It was a world-wide type of
                    thing, with Danny the Red and others, going on. I think in many ways, the German
                    political leadership, the older ones, were perplexed. I mean, “My God, we've
                    come out of the ashes and given you this prosperous country. What's your
                    problem?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Were you in the political section everywhere else
                        kind of looking under rocks and underneath bushes and all for the Nazis,
                        neo-Nazis? I'm not talking about real Nazis, but a rise of Nazi-like
                        tendencies or something like this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: The skinheads, I think, really came much later. I think there was always
                    the question, particularly among the CSU and the Bavarians of, “Where were you
                    in 1944?”</p>
                <p>It was always an aspect in Germany and one of the problems was German
                    insensitivity to how they were perceived by others: the Americans, the Dutch,
                    the other Europeans. You know, “Oh, it's just a little unit reunion. The boys
                    got fired up and they sang some old songs.” Yes, the “Horst Wessel” will lead.
                    The Jewish tour group or the Dutch tour group nearby did not exactly appreciate
                    this. What a shock. Our emphasis in the consular section for anybody over the
                    age of fifty was, “Where were you? What were you doing?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way that was history, but looking for a rerise of
                        Nazi-like tendencies.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Oh I think Dick Smyser, the political minister, was a lot smarter than
                    that. There was always probably going to be that 2-3% fringe in Germany, but it
                    wasn't really all that crucial at that point. I think in that era, particularly
                    in the old line labor counselors and attaches, we were much more looking for
                    Reds under the bed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there at all a feeling that any group of people there
                        has to be at least one East German spy or somebody like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>TYSON: Well the East Germans were certainly good, given what happened to Willi
                    Brandt and others, I suspect that at the end of the day we'll never ever really
                    totally know, but I would suspect that a lot of that society was fairly porous.
                    They understood each other. I'm sure that the West had some pretty good spies in
                    the East. I had some friends who had come over the wall, or over the border, and
                    the demographics in Germany were changing enough so that the Germans could get
                    native born West Germans. They were probably, at the end of the day, more
                    reliable. They always spoke about all Germans being Germans. I had one or two
                    friends that I think would've like to have worked for the security service “the
                    Stasi,” but they had come over as teenagers and that just was not going to
                    happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything else we should cover that you can think
                        of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Yes. Ambassador Stoessel; wonderful man. Movie star good looks. Story was
                    that he had actually auditioned for the movies as a young man. He'd been brought
                    to Germany from Moscow. He was a small man, always very well turned out. There
                    are days where he did not look up to his full potential. But, a wonderful man to
                    work for and later became deputy secretary. Stoessel was absolutely the central
                    casting image of what you wanted an ambassador to be and of course having come
                    out of Moscow, knew Russia very well. It was also at that point that I remember
                    one evening when he actually had the junior officers over, he had a very nice
                    little collection of icons and so forth, but that was really the senior reaching
                    out to the JOs (Junior Officers); it was the beginning of that push.</p>
                <p>The other story from Bonn days was Joe Califano, the Secretary of Health
                    Education and Welfare, visited. It was a big deal and I was going to be control
                    officer for some of his people because he had a rather large delegation.
                    Delegations were known to stupidly ignore our advice on how long it takes to get
                    from here to there. They were always going to push it and they were always late,
                    which is very rude in Germany. But Califano is arriving; he's coming in from
                    England. It was very interesting. Went out to K�ln Bonn Airport, I think this
                    was in the fall, so it's at night which means it's foggy. I'm in a leather
                    trench coat, looking like someone from a British “B” movie and Califano's plane
                    comes in and Al Haig's plane comes in from Brussels. They land the planes and
                    taxi them nose to nose. Califano pops out, goes on to Haig's plane. They meet
                    for about an hour. This is all after Watergate and they had all known each other
                    back then. So my colleague and I go onto the little executive jet that's brought
                    Califano in and there are some deputy assistant secretaries from HEW and one of
                    the first ones says, “Well we wore out the people in England, we hope you can
                    stand the pace.” I just figured, “You're on my turf. Watch this. Watch this. I
                    will run you into the ground,” and that's exactly what I did.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>We got them all to the hotel, and the next day we went to a meeting with the
                    German association of doctors that dealt with health insurance matters because
                    the issue was healthcare cost containment. They put out a very nice breakfast
                    spread - a cold European buffet, but Califano was on a diet so neither he nor
                    his staff was eating, so the head of the association said to me in German,
                    “What's wrong with the food?” I said, “Nothing. He's on a diet,” and so the guy
                    proceeded to load up my plate with smoked trout and everything else which I
                    proceeded to scarf down as he was smiling and Califano was glaring at me. I
                    figured, “Eh, get a clue.” At a break, I looked at them and said, “Eat. It's
                    rude if you don't,” so one or two of the doctors I think took a lettuce leaf or
                    something like that.</p>
                <p>But Califano was sort of a very feisty type and Ambassador Stoessel did a
                    reception for him. My wife and I were walking through and he had his arm in a
                    sling because he had injured his elbow. I came up beside him and the ambassador
                    is right there, so he looks and in front of the ambassador said, “So what do you
                    do here besides meet planes?” I looked at him and said, “I marry your staff,”
                    because my wife was on a year's leave of absence from HEW. That was an opening
                    and they actually chatted and it was quite nice. So that was the Califano and
                    Haig story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there during the Watergate, or had you left?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: I had left. I was in Washington during Watergate, working in EB.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you leave Bonn?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: I left in late June of 1978.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: I went to become staff aide in the office of the undersecretary for
                    security assistance, science and technology. The undersecretary was Lucy Wilson
                    Benson and her deputy was Dr. Joseph Nye, who is now up at Harvard. The other
                    staff aide was David Welch, who is about to become ambassador to Egypt. I came
                    in there and what was striking about the office was that we had some of the
                    first coffee on the seventh floor in the morning, so we had people like Marisa
                    Lino who was a staff aide and SP [Policy Planning Staff] comedown; she was later
                    ambassador in Albania, and Bob Gallucci who was an INR analyst at that point. So
                    it was a period in which I got to know a lot of these people. Warren Christopher
                    was the deputy secretary and one of his assistants was Ned Walker who later was
                    ambassador to Egypt and NEA [Near East Affairs Bureau] assistant secretary. So
                    the seventh floor perspective was quite interesting.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>We were doing a lot on conventional arms controls; the U.S. was trying to
                    restrain the arms races. It was one of the Carter initiatives that basically
                    failed. Joe Nye was very involved in a lot of nuclear nonproliferation. There
                    was some stuff about nuclear storage on an island in the Pacific called Palmyra
                    Island. It was an interesting time for that. One of the things that came in,
                    happened after I was there for about a month; I went into the conference room
                    and saw a series of safes - we had a sort of office boy in there - and I said,
                    “What's in there?” “A lot of old files from when this office suite used to
                    belong to Carlyle Maw, who I think was Kissinger's legal adviser.” The task was
                    basically to clean out and retire that stuff, and all that I can really say
                    about that is I doubt that the American public will ever, ever, truly know the
                    complete story behind Watergate and the Pentagon papers. We shredded a lot of
                    stuff; it was other agencies' stuff. But it was stunning to see what was in
                    there, and I'll just leave it at that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the first place you were up with in this job from '79
                        to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: End of '79; I was there for eighteen months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were working for Nye or Benson or?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Lucy Benson and Nye actually. David Welch and Nye were very close. One of
                    the special assistants was William Marsh, Bill Marsh, who later was a DCM
                    somewhere in Europe. It's just, that you're a staff aide, you're a high-price
                    office manager. You basically do what the principal wants. Used to go and get
                    the classified materials in the morning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about both Nye and Benson. What was your
                        impression of how they operated and how effective they were? What were they
                        after?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Lucy Benson had been with the League of Women voters and I think a classic
                    Schedule C appointment. I mean, she wanted to advance to a higher office at some
                    point. A charming lady; a little bit of a tough broad in some ways, but you sort
                    of liked her. I think she was much better in person than she was before a
                    congressional committee because she never really explained a lot of the nuances
                    of the Conventional Arms Transfer Restraint Policy, if I remember it correctly.
                    She was sort of a nice enough person to work for, I think she thought that she
                    was more highly regarded by Secretary Vance and others than she probably was,
                    but of course remember at this point she was also the highest ranking female
                    appointee in State Department history. Nye was, is, will be, incredibly smart.
                    Harvard connections and nuclear nonproliferation was his issue. He was a very,
                    very good policy animal. Clearly on his way up and it's been twenty-plus years
                    since then and he's done very, very well. He was someone in the Democratic Party
                    policy establishment who was going to be a player. That was clear. I think
                    Benson had hoped for something, but of course, once Carter lost it was over for
                    her.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel on the Carter administration? I
                        realize you were a staff aide, but on nuclear efforts for nonproliferation,
                        was there anything resulting from all these efforts there that you now see
                        more clearly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: I think at that time they were onto a lot of the issues which have
                    persisted: nuclear waste storage, and the whole Palmyra Island issue was to
                    create a repository in the Pacific. That really has not been resolved. Immense
                    concerns, even then, about Pakistan and India, which of course persisted through
                    the years. I don't think they made any dramatic changes at that point, but they
                    certainly were part of the progression of the broad policy issues. Those were
                    also sort of issues that people working in PM [Bureau of Political-Military
                    Affairs] or INR or elsewhere were involved with. So a lot of the information and
                    knowledge about that continued within the government when the Carter
                    administration left. Carter, of course, was trained as a nuclear engineer and
                    had a lot of personal stake in that. On some memos concerning this (we'd get the
                    comeback copies) the president would have noted some fairly detailed comments in
                    the margins on arcane technical and nuclear issues. Frankly, as I've said
                    before, does the president of the United States have time to do this?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Pentagon; did you get a feeling that there
                        was a war between the Pentagon and the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: There were on the arms restraint policy, but of course, Mrs. Benson
                    chaired the Arms Export Control Board. This is really where you saw the “tough
                    broad” side. There were times when she just rolled over the Pentagon. In spite
                    of Carter having been an Annapolis grad and a naval officer, there were aspects
                    of his defense policies that were not popular in the Pentagon. On other matters
                    we actually worked fairly closely together: arms sales to the Saudis and so
                    forth. There were the F-15 sales that had gone on just before and then, of
                    course the minute they got that they were going in for extra wing tanks and
                    other things like that. So on those issues State and DOD (Department of Defense)
                    were working fairly in close coordination in trying to get it through the
                    Hill.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left when in '79?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: December in '79.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there in time to see the impact of all this of
                        the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>TYSON: Not so much the invasion of Afghanistan. Our office was much, much more
                    involved with the collapse of the Shah of Iran because of all the weapon sales
                    to Iran, particularly the issue of compromising the F-14s and the Tomcats and
                    other things. Mrs. Benson was in telephone contact with General Heiser on that
                    sort of thing; his trip out there to prop up the Shah. So it was really quite
                    interesting to watch all of that unravel. And then of course the hostage
                    situation happened in fairly short order. I'm not quite sure of the time,
                    but?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: November, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Yes, I was still around for those types of things. So we were very, very
                    concerned about Iran and we had what later became known as the “Ayatollah class
                    of Frigates” under constructions. People forget just what a huge arms
                    relationship we had with Iran.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well the story is that Benson and Kissinger came back from
                        one of the later visits to the Shah and told him whatever they want, they
                        can have. It was Iranian money, and oil money, and we'd sop it up. The
                        Carter administration had done nothing to stop it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Well, there was another factor, too. Very often those sales, in spite of
                    the export controls, made lower costs available to the Pentagon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. The Pentagon was always sort of pushing this.
                        They don't really want the other people to be able to use them against us,
                        but at the same time the cost per unit goes down.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: The one that was interesting was, I think the F-5G, which would've been an
                    export-only model, and the Carter administration killed that, or at least it
                    died. I think the F-14s and the Tomcats were some of the most important stuff
                    though.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go at the end of '79?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: I went to the six month economic course at FSI for FSI training; so
                    January of '80 to June of '80.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>TYSON: Fairly rigorous. It was a good course in some ways. It reminded me a great
                    deal of the first year of law school; there's a lot of posturing and attitude.
                    My father died very suddenly during the course - I think at the end of March. So
                    I went up to New Jersey and I'm bailing out of the course and this is one of
                    those, “If you leave for three days, you are forever lost. You will never catch
                    up.” There were things that I had to do with my family and there was also a week
                    of sitting “shiva” and my father died while he was on a business trip so I had
                    to go up to Watkins Glen, New York and literally retrieve the car, and just a
                    lot of obligations.</p>
                <p>One of the things that had happened resulted from my law school training. There
                    were one or two other lawyers who were FSOs in the economic course and we
                    rapidly decided we needed a study group. So we formulated one. The course was
                    taught in modules and I remember there was something on public finance. I only
                    went to the first and last class, and the class instructors said, “Well, what
                    about taking the exam; what do you want to do?” and I said, “Well, let me try
                    taking it.” I went to my ad hoc study group and said, “Forget substance. What
                    are the questions? What are the answers? Just give it to me.” And I think I got
                    a “B” on it, which just stunned everybody. In later years a lot of the stuff
                    that supposedly I was going to use from the course, realistically wasn't used in
                    an economic section. I suspect in many ways that had to do more with a lack of
                    computers and software. But it was interesting to have taken it. It certainly
                    served me well. It also presaged me going off for university training in
                    economics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can't remember if she was still there at the time. Did
                        you work with Frances Wilson?</hi>

                <p>TYSON: Yes, she had been the EB [Economics Bureau] executive director, queen of
                    assignments, and quite a legend - lo be to those who crossed her. But on the
                    other hand, she knew how to maneuver the system and in her heart of hearts I
                    really think she cared a great deal about the Economics Bureau and really set
                    out to take care of the people in it. One of those real legendary people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you got out, I guess, halfway through 1980 or so? What
                        then happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>TYSON: I was assigned to EUR/RPE, the Regional Political and Economic Cooperation
                    Office (Europe) which basically did our mission to the European community and
                    the OECD [Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development]. I basically
                    did a lot of the industrial trade issues, and I also followed the OECD industry
                    committee and the trade committee. I got involved in issues involving steel,
                    automobile restraints, chemicals, energy pricing, and a lot of basic economic
                    issues involved in our trading relationship with the European community. I was
                    also sort of the assignments clerk and reservations clerk for the various
                    committees. You'd get cables over from the Commerce Department or others
                    regarding people going to meetings. Commerce used to always hack me off because
                    there would be a reservations cable for something two months hence and they'd
                    type it up as an immediate. So you'd strike it out, send it back, their nose
                    would get out of joint, and you'd sort of take it from there. I also sat in on a
                    number of USTR [Office of the U.S. Trade Representative] committees and things
                    like that. So it was a fairly interesting job. It tended to involve, about every
                    four to six months, travel to Europe; some combination of Paris, Brussels, and
                    London, which was nice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you were doing this from '80 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: '83.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling towards the OECD at that time? I mean
                        from the American point of view.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Oh, periodically I think we were trying to revitalize certain committees
                    within the OECD, but the OECD was sort of a talking forum. It was a wonderful
                    sort of travel benefit for people in the Commerce Department or the Census
                    Bureau. My impression on working at the OECD; everybody used to get spun-up
                    about the communiqu� issued after the secretaries of state or the presidents and
                    others met; most of that, frankly, was crap. You got more things done affecting
                    the lives of the citizens in every one of these countries when you just let the
                    working level expert meetings go forward. You probably got more out of a traffic
                    sign safety committee than you did out of some of the “we'll leap tall buildings
                    in a single bound” type of thing. You know, I realize that's the stuff that
                    State Department work is made of, but you get spun-up for the OECD ministerial,
                    and much huffing and puffing and smoke, and did anybody remember it three months
                    later?</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>Meanwhile, some of the committees and subcommittees were more effective than
                    others, and others were just some schedule, to see who had the chance to do a
                    week in Paris on a regular basis. So in my work I was always happy to help out
                    those that you saw really doing something and the rest you did the reservations
                    or this or that. Periodically we'd end up going over as part of a delegation and
                    one of the most valuable things you did as the State Department officer was
                    draft the cable. What I never understood though was behavior of some heads of
                    delegation, you know, the meeting is done at 12:30 in the afternoon in Paris,
                    they rush out to the airport to get onto a plane to get back to Washington just
                    in time to close their stateside office. This made no sense, but the number of
                    people who did it was stunning. I tended to stay on at least through the
                    Saturday, very often through the Sunday, at my own expense for the Sunday just
                    to see a bit of Paris. Live a little bit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you come into contact with sort of the European cadre
                        that was working the other side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Oh yes, all the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Ah, generally very good. Look at Europe. The word bureaucrat or permanent
                    civil service is something of a thing of honor. If anything, their objections
                    were the constantly changing cast of Americans they saw. You know, you just get
                    one trained up and off you go. They then have to train the next. You'd get some
                    of the Austrians and others, I mean, my God, they'd been there ten years at the
                    creation - knew every twist and turn on these things. Very, very
                    professional.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about manufacturing interests; you know our steel
                        manufacturers, automobile manufacturers, did they lobby us to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Oh absolutely. They tended to do it through the trade reps office and of
                    course the White House and Congress. Steel, of course, has been a perennial
                    issue, and during that time the “voluntary Japanese automobile restraints” was
                    another hot issue. The auto companies were arrogant, this is the best way to put
                    it, and to some degree contemptuous of the bureaucrats. I remember meeting with
                    a Ford executive who was pushing to support the restraints which were primarily
                    directed at the Japanese, but there was some backlash potential against the
                    Europeans which concerned me. But I remember him saying, “Well, we need five
                    years to develop front-wheel drive technology,” and I looked at him and said,
                    “Well why don't you wire your plant in Cologne and get the blueprints of the
                    Fiesta?”</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: And he was stunned that a bureaucrat knew anything about his industry,
                    knew about the product line, and could comment on, “Oh, this is such crap.” Well
                    my father had sold cars when he retired from the army and I've always been sort
                    of a closet gear head and there were actually about four of us working the issue
                    in the Department that met with the manufacturer's reps and I think they were
                    quite surprised at how knowledgeable we were about the world industry. So the
                    sympathy factor for Detroit was slight.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there sort of the feeling that Detroit was being
                        slippy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Oh absolutely, and in the case of Ford it was their profits in Europe that
                    kept them afloat while they transitioned themselves. The quality was off, they
                    were building ugly cars. It was really beginning to become not even a price
                    thing as the Japanese were coming up on terms of the perceived quality.</p>
                <p>Just in this era, I remember saying to my sister who was single at the time and
                    needed a car, “Oh go buy a Toyota or a Nissan,” because they had just switched
                    over from a Datsun. She went out and bought a Pontiac Sunbird that was the
                    biggest rolling piece of crap that I'd seen in a long time. The car was nothing
                    but heartache and two years later she went out and got the Nissan, and I think
                    that was a story repeated many, many times in America. There are American cars
                    that I absolutely like, but there was just a lot of crap coming out the assembly
                    lines and if you were to ask a lot of the companies these days to look back on
                    their products, they'd probably agree.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things I've always felt about steel was that a
                        steel plant, to a lot of countries, is a symbol of something that employs a
                        lot of people, and the call is more for specialized steel these days and not
                        for just producing steel. Politically, it's very hard to shut these things
                        down and that ends up with dumping and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: I had no particular problems on the real legitimate dumping things. When
                    you've got into steel, you got into other factors. One, look at Baltimore. Our
                    plants were simply old. They hadn't gotten the investment they needed. Under any
                    sort of circumstances we had a tier of our industry that was just noncompetitive
                    and the question was, “When would you shut it down and retire it?” Some of the
                    newer plants and certainly specialty steels and products, particularly the
                    electric furnaces were competitive.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>I remember being in on some of the steel talks and one Belgian looking at me and
                    saying, “You know if we shut this, someone might have to go twenty kilometers
                    for a job,” at a time when the rustbelt was depopulating to Houston. People were
                    living in cars in Houston. My response was, “You'll forgive me for not being
                    terribly sympathetic to your problems when we have people living in cars in
                    Houston.” I had no problems about really hammering it home and doing some tough
                    negotiating. But on the issue that we had an industry that was just in decline
                    and it was a question of time; it's like, “Boys and girls, figure it out,” and
                    let's get beyond this. In a sense, low cost imports at various points have also
                    been beneficial to the American consumer. I've got no problems with legitimate
                    dumping issues, and that continues to this day, but we have not made the
                    investment. You look at the age of our plants versus others; it's not surprising
                    that we're not as competitive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, in '83 you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Let's see, yes, a turning point in my life. My first marriage ended,
                    probably not unexpectedly, but somewhat more suddenly than I'd expected. It was
                    very interesting because I was to be in the job in RPE until that summer, and at
                    that point I was scheduled to go off to university training and I had some
                    choices. It was in economics. My wife and I had friends in Wisconsin. She was
                    going to stay here and work, and I would go to Wisconsin. My other alternative
                    was Stanford. So I agreed to do this and shortly thereafter my marriage
                    collapsed and I thought I'd like to go to California and the State Department
                    said, “You'll love Wisconsin.” So Wisconsin it was going to be.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>In the meantime, my replacement had come out of the economic course some six
                    months early. Follow me on thithe OECD had decided to have the first ever urban
                    ministerial meeting, and our HUD [Housing and Urban Development] secretary was
                    Sam Pierce, one of the black Republican cabinet members. Quite frankly, my
                    office was looking for anybody who could make this meeting fly. So they brought
                    my replacement in and basically turned my portfolios over to him and I took on
                    the urban ministerial, dealing with a cabinet member. One of the things that had
                    happened was a certain number of trips were out of central funding and a certain
                    amount of trips were out of European Bureau funding and this was always a
                    battle. I had worked on this not only for myself, but for other people, for
                    three years. And actually the people down in central funding were so delighted
                    to find anybody who would take this on that they agreed to fund me. That was
                    fine. Well, my deputy director found out about this and attempted to steal the
                    funds for himself, and central funding said, “No, you take it away, you don't
                    get it.” So I was assigned to go to Paris with Secretary Pierce. Did a lot of
                    the work on this and ended up going over there. My replacement was in place so I
                    asked the Department, “I've got a lot of leave. How about me taking a month
                    off?” and then I called up some friends at USTR and said, “What do you have
                    going on in Europe at about the time I leave Paris?” They said, “I actually have
                    got some meetings in Geneva. Want to come?” So I managed to put together six
                    weeks in Europe with meetings at each end, to do that, then proceeded to get
                    some Eurail passes and travel around Europe. That was a good thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Secretary Pierce? As I recall, and please
                        correct me if I'm wrong, he was sort of, to put it nicely, a cipher as far
                        as in the Reagan cabinet; he seemed to be very quiet and didn't stand out
                        particularly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: That's pretty much it. He shined a bit more as the American on the
                    international stage. I can't remember the man in question, but he had a black
                    former ambassador sort of over there working with him. He was a charming guy. A
                    very funny guy. He and I ended up working together and the ambassador's job was
                    to make Pierce look good. This was pretty much the agenda there.</p>
                <p>Pierce seemed to have a certain amount of clout in that one or two minor things
                    that he wanted on the trip. State was balking and he just had the White House
                    take care of it. But in terms of dealing with him, he was very, very pleasant to
                    me, and by and large, to the staff around him. He had a lot of his inner staff
                    from the agency to “Whatever you want, your leisure, grace,” but the ambassador
                    and I seemed to do it fairly well and he seemed to be grateful for what I did as
                    an FSO. Our ambassador to the OECD at that point was Abe Katz, who was a sort of
                    feisty, short, in-your-face, New York type of guy. I was to negotiate the
                    communiqu� in Paris, and I'm standing there next to a cabinet minister and Katz
                    gratuitously comes over, wags a finger in my nose, which means that he's
                    reaching up since I'm taller than he is, and says, “Don't give the store away in
                    front of the cabinet member,” which was like, “Oh, please.” But, Secretary
                    Pierce, himself, was pleasant enough and then the conference was over.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the issue of the conference?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: It was an OECD first-ever urban ministerial meeting: urban challenges in
                    the OECD. So you had urban ministers or interior ministers there. The role of
                    cities, the problems of cities, cities how they go. So it was interestingly
                    enough, and of course as the first ever, it's “Well, what will our work program
                    in the future be?” Important enough as far as that went.</p>

                <p>TYSON: Actually it turned out to be almost eleven since I managed to extend it

                <p>TYSON: The Democratic Party in exile. (laughs) Well, Wisconsin always has had a
                    very, very good reputation on economics and they've produced policy makers and
                    government officials out of that. Of course, this is a Republican administration
                    in Washington, but there were some real world names out there, and a very, very
                    good department it was.</p>
                <p>I took a variety of courses; I took courses on labor and a number of other
                    things. I think part of the objective of this, too, was to have a very visible
                    Foreign Service Officer in the university environment, because you'd get
                    students coming up to talk to you about the Foreign Service and the career and
                    everything else. But no, Wisconsin had a very, very good department.</p>
                <p>It was interesting being there as someone with a salary and a little bit older
                    because academia can be absolutely vicious and grad students can be awful. I
                    used to remember people stealing notices for teaching assistantships out of my
                    boxes, and I caught one guy doing this saying, “I don't care. I'm not going to
                    apply for it. I'm here on something totally different. Why are you doing this?”
                    But there would be that viciousness and that competitiveness there. It was an
                    interesting place and I think the State Department was right in sending you to a
                    part of the country where you're not from, or you hadn't gone to school. As it
                    turns out, I did get in touch with a number of friends out there and it was
                    probably a good place to be for me.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '84 you were where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: '84 I came back and then I was scheduled to go out to Osaka, Japan. I was
                    going to start Japanese language training, which I did. I was not the most
                    brilliant Japanese student that they'd ever had, although I guess I was
                    adequate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How old were you at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Thirty-four.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were beginning to move into the more difficult time to
                        pick up a hard language.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: There was another dynamic behind this Japanese language training.
                    Traditionally the Chrysanthemum Club had gotten political officers and/or
                    linguists and trained them. Now with the automobile problem and everything else,
                    economic problems with Japan were becoming more crucial. So what the Department
                    wanted was economists with Japanese language training, and I was one of the
                    first of the crew that they attempted to do this with.</p>
                <p>At this time I was trundling along, still recovering from a divorce and starting
                    to date my current wife. I got called in by the linguist; he was a
                    Korean-American named Mr. Park, and he basically said, “Well, you know, you're
                    just not quite doing as well as you could, so we'll let you finish your first
                    year of Japanese. You can then go to Osaka, but you can't have the second year
                    in Yokohama.” Well, you know, if you're undertaking this program with its career
                    implications and they weren't going to let me get the golden ring, why am I
                    doing this? So I had heard about the MFO (Multi-national Force and Observers) in
                    the Sinai. At this point I'd been in the Foreign Service almost eleven years,
                    never done a hardship post. So I went in, took a look at that, and rapidly
                    switched myself to six weeks of fast Egyptian-Arabic and went to the Sinai. I
                    heard later that the Japanese and Korean Department was stunned. You know, I
                    mean literally, “We're done? Okay, I'm done. Goodbye.” I heard from people later
                    on that there were repercussions and that they chewed up a number of other econ
                    officers, and I have heard, and it's apocryphal, that at some point there was
                    the “come to Jesus meeting” of “This is what the Department wants you to do.
                    This is what we need and you're chewing these people up and this is not
                    good.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had the feeling that they really weren't with you
                        there? I mean, it was sort of grudgingly.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>TYSON: It was a grudging type of thing and I ran across another econ officer who
                    had virtually an identical experience and had done the same thinjust pulled the
                    plug, and I think the Asia Bureau and others were going, “This is not good.” So
                    I ended up going on to a year in the MFO in the Sinai.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: MFO stood for what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Multi-national Force and Observers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about that. You were doing that from when to
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: I ended up going out in April of 1985 to El Gorah in the Sinai, and stayed
                    there until basically April or May of '86.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did we have something there, and what were you
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: This went back to the Camp David Accords and the Israeli staged withdrawal
                    from the Sinai. It was finally completed in 1983. Initially there had been
                    something called the Sinai Field Mission. Let me back up a bit. I think there
                    had been an attempt to have a UN [United Nations] force out there, but the
                    Russians were difficult about it. So we created the Sinai Field Mission, or
                    maybe that came later, but the Sinai Field Mission was there to monitor?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also I don't think the Israelis would, having been burned
                        by the UN before, they weren't going to take anything with a UN label.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: I think that's true, although they still had some vestigial UN observers
                    present in the Sinai even when I was there. The Sinai Field Mission had been
                    there and they had been running a lot of monitoring sites at Gidi and Mitla
                    Passes. And then, I think at the actual time of the withdrawal, it reconfigured
                    itself into the Multi-National Force and Observers. So we had the U.S., the
                    Brits, the Dutch, the French, the Italians, the Anzacs, the Colombians, and the
                    Uruguayans, and the Fijians out there all doing this. And the civilian observer
                    group at that point was about twenty-six people. The process was that you
                    resigned from the Foreign Service and you were employed by the MFO, but you had
                    reemployment rights. The observers were commanded by a Foreign Service Officer,
                    Bob Steven, while I was out there. His deputy was Lou Kachanic. About half of
                    the people were retired or ex-military and the other half were Foreign Service
                    Officers.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>Basically what you did was monitoring and verification in the Sinai. You had a
                    three kilometer long strip inside Israel along their border, and then the entire
                    Sinai. There were different zones as to what the Egyptians were permitted to
                    have where, and a number of other things. You'd look for violations like they
                    had a tank here when they shouldn't or they had heavy artillery here when they
                    shouldn't. That's what you did. You ran around in stunning orange uniforms - the
                    orange jumpsuit was particularly fetching, which really made you stand out. It
                    was interesting because the garbage sweepers in Saudi Arabia wore that. But you
                    had your orange jumpsuits with your American flag on it and your MFO seal and
                    stuff like this.</p>
                <p>Actually it was one of the great adventures. You know, you were out there in sort
                    of a paramilitary organization, you had a huge fascinating portion of the world,
                    you had vehicles and aircraft at your disposal, and minefields and stuff. It
                    wasn't all beer and Skittles. And a tough environment, but quite an adventure.
                    Quite an introduction to the Middle East. You know you'd do the Israelis in the
                    morning and the Egyptians in the afternoon, so you got a chance to see both
                    sides. You had access through the border so you literally could drive into Tel
                    Aviv or Jerusalem for the weekend. It was quite interesting. I think you had, I
                    fit the profile coming off a divorce, but you had divorce-wounded or people
                    paying for kids in college or this was a good way to get the hardship post
                    requirement out of the way in the year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of first, the Israelis, and then
                        the Egyptians, and how they were reacting to the situation? I mean, was this
                        really active or had we gone quiet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: It was pretty much sort of quiet. Every now and then you'd get a
                    hard-liner on the Egyptian or the Israeli side with a real hard-on about the
                    other side and your presence there, and you'd sort of have to slap them down.
                    But a lot of the Israelis, actually, were reservists. And also what happened is
                    both sides tended to pick people with foreign language ability to deal with us.
                    You know, Egypt had a draft and all of these poor French literature or English
                    literature majors from Alexandria or Cairo ended up in their equivalent of East
                    Coffee Cup, Mississippi. You know, serving beyond the beyond, dealing with these
                    foreigners. Some really nice, sweet kids, but there they were butting up against
                    Gaza and stuff. And you know, they're all twenty-two. They're all far from home.
                    That was the Egyptians who we tended to have more contact with. If you went into
                    Israel you'd often get someone who is a diamond dealer in Netanya and he's got a
                    branch office in New York and he's got the BMW in Herzliya. It was no real
                    problem dealing with them.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>Some of the verification was done in vehicles, some in helicopters. A lot of our
                    ex-military guys were special forces. There was a tendency to do the macho thing
                    of “how quickly can I do it from lift-off to touchdown at the airfield?” and the
                    operations director was Andy Biotus. He was a retired army colonel, I think. One
                    day he called me in and he said, “I will see you six hours from now. You are
                    going to do the 'tea tour'.” One of the reasons that they had FSOs along on
                    this, was for the cultural sensitivity. There were some of these remote little
                    Egyptian army units in the center of the Sinai that God had long ago forgotten
                    and they were so pathetically grateful to see you that, they would invite you
                    to, “Come sit, come have tea. What do you want to see? We'll show you
                    everything.” And Andy's point was, get there, shut the copter down, sit and have
                    tea, chatter about this or that, and then go on. There was a real importance in
                    terms of that contact and the familiarity.</p>
                <p>One of the funniest incidents that I had was with my teammate on the day who was
                    John Mayhew and is now working over in the Department. We had our Egyptian
                    escort officer along and we were at a bakery near the Suez Canal. So we go in,
                    and I mean it's a bakery, fine, sometimes they give you fresh bread, we had food
                    with us so that wasn't the problem, but the major ushers us in and we sit down.
                    We've got our twenty-two-year-old Egyptian there and the guy is very, very
                    pleasant and what he wants to talk about is contraceptives. He's married, wife
                    has just had a child or something like that, and he wants to talk about
                    contraceptives and he's making this absolutely young Egyptian lieutenant who is
                    probably a virgin and absolutely dying and blushing, translate - and fairly
                    graphic translations. We basically said, “Well actually, what you should
                    probably do is have your wife get in touch with a female obstetrician at the
                    American University in Cairo. They'll be able to take her through all of the
                    options,” and stuff like this. At that point, okay, he asked both of us whether
                    we were married and I said, “Well actually I'm divorced, but John's a father,”
                    and all of that, and this poor lieutenant was just dying. And of course we'd
                    gotten the cultural training here saying the Arabs never talk about sex. Well,
                    that's all they talked about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there violations that were playing games? You know,
                        sometimes with troops they've got to do something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: It was more than playing games. There were some times where there were
                    even more than overt violations. The Egyptians were pushing the envelope now and
                    then. The Israelis had a tendency to over fly Egypt. It wasn't just bored troops
                    in some cases, although there was a bit of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happens if you found a violation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: We wrote it up.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wrote it up. Both sides would respond, I mean if there
                        was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Yes, pretty much. I think ultimately the best description I had is that we
                    were the lubricating oil between the gears. Both sides needed some dead
                    Americans there if anything ever broke out. But you know, if the level of
                    complaint about our unfairness was about the same on both sides, we were
                    probably doing the job that was needed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about within your own units? How did you all get
                        along?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: At first, not well. There was a real division between the military types
                    and the State types when I first got there. And I think Bob Steven and Lou
                    Kachanic worked on this. A lot was personalities. My perception of some of the
                    State officers when I first got there, and a number of them are my friends, was
                    that even though we were the same chronological age, they were just younger. The
                    military guys, I think, tended to be contemptuous of them for that. There wasn't
                    necessarily a lot of understanding on both sides, and then what happened is we
                    got some retired military officers in who had done embassy duty and then FSOs
                    like me who'd grown up around the military, or people who had served. So there
                    was more of a convergence in the middle as to, “Yes, I know what you do, you
                    know what I do,” and I think it was just more of a change in the personality mix
                    that, you know, you sort of respected your colleagues.</p>
                <p>Also, when I first got there, you were supposed to make up your map and there was
                    a lot of these games of, “I'm not going to tell you,” from the military guys.
                    Well I had taken drafting in high school so I went into the operations center
                    and I knew how to use tracing vellum to copy maps, so the first time I did it, I
                    did it on vellum and punched through various checkpoints and sites. I got
                    criticized by the military because one location was wrong and I pointed out to
                    them, “If it's wrong on my map, it's wrong in the op center, too.” But I kept
                    the vellum and after that when an FSO came in they'd get the drill, “You've got
                    to figure it out,” and I'd say, “Come on over to my hooch. Here's the overlay on
                    the map. Punch it through this way, mark it up this way.” But it was a lot of
                    the “boys stuff,” the macho type of thing and sort of once you “made your bones”
                    and showed that you could do the stuff, you could write the reports and you knew
                    what you were looking at, you were okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it the units were essentially American units,
                        French units, British units, what-have-you. They didn't intermix?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>TYSON: Well, they had different functions. Actually, in a sense, there was a bit
                    of a mix in the headquarters. The Brits were the headquarters unit, the Dutch
                    were the cops, the Uruguayans were the truck drivers and engineers, the Fijians
                    and the Colombians were the ground-pounders - the infantry troops manning the
                    various outposts, the American troops that we had at North Camp were more
                    logistical support and technicians for our headquarters units. South Camp was
                    where they had the airborne units which were more our straight-leg troops, or
                    infantry troops; airborne is not straight-leg. There was sort of a division of
                    labor. The French had the fixed-wing aircraft; the Otters and the Transalls, the
                    Anzacs did the rotary-wing. So I mean it all sort of fit together because we
                    knew all the helicopter pilots because they were always flying us. We were one
                    of the reasons they were there.</p>
                <p>The other unifying thing was the strip of bars on the base. The Dutch had a club,
                    the Brits had a club, the Uruguayans had a club, the French had a club, and
                    you'd go bar-hopping. The Anzacs had the Surf Club. So it was very interesting
                    because Al Gorah which was an ex-Israeli airbase, and quite correctly the
                    headquarters and the commander had very strict drunk driving rules and it was a
                    small enough base you could walk. They never really said much about drunk
                    bicycling, so everybody had bicycles. As a matter of fact, there was usually a
                    rash of bicycle thefts just before the Anzacs went home. It was a small enclosed
                    base with that and you tended to actually get to know people better through the
                    bars.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there problems with Bedouin going back and
                        forth?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: The biggest problems we had with the Bedouin were them tapping into our
                    water pipes periodically. The stuff about the Bedouin was very interesting
                    because actually what we were hearing, and I don't know whether you've
                    interviewed Chester Pavlovski, but you should on all of this - he's an
                    ex-consular officer, but he was an observer and then sort of the resident
                    archaeologist, the line was that actually the Bedouin, the real Bedouin,
                    preferred the Israelis more. The Israelis basically stayed out of a lot of their
                    internal family matters, but if you had a sick kid or something they'd take care
                    of it. It used to be very interesting because the Bedouin actually knew a lot of
                    Israeli products, food products, very well. We were trying to share the
                    expenditures between Israel and Egypt. The only way the tally ever came close
                    was when they bought a lot of gold in the market in Egypt. You know you could go
                    to Israel and say, “I need ten cases of tomatoes six weeks from now, grade 2.”
                    “Fine.” You know, you'd go to the Egyptians and, “I need tomatoes,” “Well, if
                    God gives us tomatoes, you'll have tomatoes.” So a lot of the actual food on the
                    camp was Israeli, including stuff like packaged yogurfruit-flavored stuff and
                    all.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>I remember you'd go out on the patrols where you had the vehicles and you'd get
                    these big green Coleman coolers and the mess hall would make up meals for you.
                    When you had the Egyptians along, they were very careful that it was “halal.”
                    But you'd have ice in there, you'd have bread, you'd have sandwiches, you'd have
                    apples, you'd have oranges, and probably more than six people could eat.
                    Sometimes the Egyptians officers who didn't like the Bedouin would throw the
                    stuff away, because you'd be sitting there parked beside a road or on an
                    overlook and a Bedouin would just sort of appear and be fifty meters,
                    seventy-five meters away from you and just sit there. So you look at them and
                    they look at you. That's fine. Very often what we would do was, having eaten
                    what we wanted, we would then gather up the stuff, you know the extra bread, the
                    this, the that, and the ice, and either leave it there or walk it over to them.
                    The Egyptians always thought we were nuts for doing this. I remember in the
                    middle of nowhere one of the Bedouins, because we had Israeli fruit-flavored
                    yogurt, I think we had apricot and something else, through sign language made it
                    clear that the next time he came he preferred the apple to the apricot. (laughs)
                    Okay, fine. But we'd hand them the ice and stuff like that, and sometimes we'd
                    also give the extra food to the Egyptian interpreters who lived right outside
                    the gate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Israel? I take it that's sort
                        of where you went for the weekends or R&amp;R (Rest and Relaxation) and that
                        sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Well, Israel was fine. That is where we went for the R&amp;Rs. I tended to
                    prefer Jerusalem to Tel Aviv. I'll fast-forward a bit by saying that my mother
                    and sister came out in January and got to Tel Aviv a day or two before I did and
                    then I came in and met them. There were three or four bars, one of them was like
                    the MASH [Mobile Army Surgical Hospital] bar and the other was the Belle at the
                    end of Dizengoff Street where the MFO and the UN guys and others all showed up.
                    It's a typical military thing, you know, bars with girls and whores. My mother
                    and sister were there, and you know my mother has been around army bases her
                    entire life, so there we are in Israel and I said, “Okay, let's go out. I'll see
                    some of my buddies at the bars,” and you know, my mom and sister walked in and
                    everybody is there including the working girls and I said, “This too is Israel.
                    Tomorrow we'll do Jerusalem.”</p>
                <p>Israel was fascinating in many ways; the archaeology, the country, the people. It
                    was a mix of things and I enjoyed it. Tel Aviv was fine, but I sort of found
                    Jerusalem, as a city and a place, much more appealing. So there would be groups
                    that would go into Tel Aviv and then groups that would go to Jerusalem. And then
                    somebody was always going up to Tiberius or Yafo or something like that. So it
                    was a chance to see the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, after this, in '86, where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: I ended up going on to Saudi Arabia, but let me back up a bit.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>When I first arrived in the Sinai, I went into Cairo and then you're flown in on
                    one of the French planes, and I've got a beard. I got off the plane and was met
                    by Clarence Stafford who I'd known from Bonn days. I showed up at the unit and
                    they looked at me and said, “You're Joseph,” and I said, “No, I'm Paul,” and
                    they said, “No, you're Joseph. This unit does a live nativity every year and
                    you're Joseph.” Well having been given a role, what could I do but go with it?
                    We had U.S. military chaplains on the base so I went off and went to the
                    chaplains assistants and got what my wife who went to parochial school would
                    call the “Revlon Jesus pictures.” You know the beautiful hair and the robes, and
                    everything else. We had Egyptian tailors on the base and I went into El Arish
                    and got some brown wool cloth. I already had the sort of “galabeya” of the
                    traditional white outfit. But I went in with the picture and me and the cloth
                    and basically said, “I want the cloak.” So they made it up and it's probably
                    still out there. We did the live nativity scene; Jeanne Cope was the Virgin
                    Mary, the Dutch doctor was one of the wise men.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was Jeanne Cope?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: She is retired now, but she was a civil servant who was out there for a
                    year as an observer. We did have some women in the unit. Jeanne decided she
                    wanted to be the Virgin Mary, so that was fine. But Bob Steven actually read the
                    story of the nativity in English, and Spanish for the Colombians and Uruguayans,
                    and I think Jeanne's and my photo is probably on about 500 mantles in Colombia
                    because these are Colombian draftees, they're eighteen or nineteen years old,
                    and there they are in the Holy Land with Joseph and Mary.</p>
                <p>My next assignment, well I knew it was coming up, so I'd gotten the bid list
                    because we sort of got them via Israel. Communications in and out of the Sinai
                    was dicey. We had some phone lines that there was a tie line into Israel and
                    then if you got the satellite you got the tie line back to the Department in the
                    States and most of the time it was busy. So there I was going out on a
                    verification and the weather was getting pretty hot and it had been one of the
                    more difficult ones, so I rolled back in at about 3:00 or 4:00 in the afternoon,
                    dusty, hot, dirty, and there was a note in the unit, “Call the Arabian Peninsula
                    Affairs Desk,”- I think Gordon Brown or something like that. You know, just
                    call.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>Okay. I tried to call. The lines were busy. What could be done? I went back to
                    the hooch, got a shower, got cleaned up, went to the mess hall, got dinner
                    because we had mess halls there, and then I went out to the Anzac Surf Club and
                    proceeded to drink beer and rum with all of my friends. And I had my bicycle. So
                    there I am in the Sinai at about 11:30 at night, tired, basically feeling no
                    pain, with my bicycle, and I figured well, actually, why don't I just drive by
                    the unit, because sometimes late at night you could open it up and the phone
                    lines would work. So I cycle over to the unit, unlock the door, go in, and bam,
                    it goes through to the desk, and I get Mr. Brown. He said, “What would you think
                    of Dhahran as an assignment?” and in one of those “in vino veritaz” [in wine
                    there is truth] or something moments, I said, “Not much. Why?” He said, “We'd
                    really like you to bid on the deputy principal officer's job out there,” so I
                    went mumble, mumble, moan, groan. I was interested in a job in Brussels and one
                    in Mexico City, but okay, I'll take it under consideration. This is like a
                    Thursday or a Friday. So I say that I'll get back to him. Some people were going
                    into Jerusalem this weekend so I figured, well Saturday why not go ask God;
                    let's go to the wall. Let's not only go to the wall, let's go into the tunnel
                    next to the wall and ask God about the assignments. Brussels is always
                    wonderful, Mexico City is good, and then, yes, there's Saudi Arabia. Right? I
                    came out of there knowing that I was going to go to Saudi Arabia. Brussels fell
                    through, Mexico City fell through, and Dhahran came on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Next time we'll pick this up in 1986 and you're off to
                        Dhahran.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where I served from 1958 to 1960, myself. Back in the
                        Middle Ages. In the first place, you were in Dhahran from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: I was in Dhahran from May 1986 to June 1988. I had come back to the States
                    and had gotten engaged. My fianc� was not necessarily all that thrilled about
                    Saudi Arabia. Of course Saudi Arabia is the type of place where you don't take
                    your girlfriend. She was working on the Hill in the Senate when we agreed that
                    I'd go out and come back and get married and she'd come out with me.</p>
                <p>So I actually resigned from the FMO, went to Cairo, saw some friends and did the
                    Nile cruise while I was technically unemployed, came back, reentered the State
                    Department, did the necessaries, and then went out to Dhahran, which was sort of
                    a real piece of history. It was an older compound, rather down at the heels in
                    many ways, but with a lot of character to it; quarried fieldstone and so
                    forth.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was consul general when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>TYSON: Consul general when I was there was John Eddy, who was entering his fourth
                    year there. I was replacing David Trotter. I had taken the job under the
                    assumption that Mr. Eddy would be going on to Bombay, but it became something of
                    a daisy chain, so that was delayed for a year. So he was the consul general.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And your job was the deputy consuno, what was your
                        job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Deputy principal officer. I did a great deal on the economic side of the
                    house in particular - a lot with ARAMCO (Arabian and American Oil company) and
                    oil issues. I also did, it was very strange, a State Department cable on the
                    defense of the Eastern Province. It was a little incongruous because we have all
                    of these military advisers out there and I had to do this cable, but I wasn't
                    supposed to talk to them and this was supposed to come out of the air. It went
                    through a whole series of drafts and was sort of an interesting experience in
                    and of itself. It was one of these classic things that after much effort, we
                    sent it in, virtually nothing ever came of it, but years later people would say
                    to me, “God, that was a great cable. I really appreciated it,” or “insightful,”
                    this, that. But basically I just wrote it as: if I were an Iranian, how would I
                    attack the Eastern Province.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But at that time it was predicated on Iran.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: It was predicated on Iran. What was going on was Iraq and Iran and there
                    was the so-called “tanker war” going on out in the Gulf, forces were picking off
                    tankergenerally going after the rudders and so forth with rocket propelled
                    grenades and everything else. I had someone working for me named Crist Caulth
                    who was an economic officer and he had very good contacts with the marine port
                    captains from the oil companies Chevron, Exxon, Texaco, and Mobil up at Ras
                    Tanura. We got a great deal of information from them about attacks that were
                    occurring. I mean literally, in a day before word processing, we had sort of
                    blank cable forms ready. You know, “The S.S. so-and-so was attacked at?” and
                    then fill in the time and geocoordinates if you had it. That was actually pretty
                    popular with both the Department and the navy at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we continue on this particular topic? While you
                        were working there, what were you seeing Iran doing? I mean, how did you see
                        an attack evolving from Iran?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: An attack from Iran - how I would do it, as a full-fledged assault?</p>

                <p>TYSON: At dawn, on one of the Eids, I would have stepped up over-flights, near
                    the median line and the Gulf, of airplanejust F-4s and other fighters, to get
                    the Saudis and others used to seeing a certain presence. Then wait for one of
                    the Eids when everybody is at prayers, absolutely turn, and go and take out
                    Abqaiq, the big gas processing plants, the piers at Ras Tanura, and a number of
                    facilities in the eastern province. Then I think they would've had a pretty good
                    chance of pulling it off. There would've been a lot of big bangs and very big
                    fires.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At this time, '86 to '88, did Iraq come into the equation
                        at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Well, what do you mean by “into the equation?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, when you were sitting there, very obviously, even
                        back when I was there in '58 to '60, we were looking at Iran. I mean, it was
                        the Shah, it was friendly and all that, but you couldn't help but figure
                        that Iran is a big country with a lot of people and Saudi Arabia is a rich
                        country with not many people. Iran was seen like the “big boy” in the
                        bought.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: It was, and there was a lot of ambivalence about this, and of course the
                    Gulf states had more than tilted towards supporting Iraq in this; mostly in
                    terms of cash, to some degree oil and other things. Something important that
                    absolutely happened, and it happened more than once. The DPOs house had a flat
                    roof. My wife and I were out on the patiwe were actually doing something up on
                    the roof, and a plane came in very low that just didn't look like any one of the
                    Saudi or the U.S. planes. It was an Iraqi Mirage. What would happen is they
                    would fly down the Gulf and attempt to bomb Khark or another Island depending
                    upon the conditions, if the weather wasn't good and they were going low on fuel,
                    they'd come into Dhahran and gas-and-go. “No one ever saw them and it never
                    happened,” but they came in low over the house and were gone in the next forty
                    minutes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there when the USS Stark was EXOCETed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: I left Dhahran that evening and found out about it in the basement of the
                    American Embassy in London the next day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ah. Well now, was Iraq seen, you know we had various
                        things, one police when I was there he had something called the Dhahran
                        Liaison Group. I don't know if that still existed, but it was essentially an
                        emergency center for evacuating that part of the Middle East. In your
                        emergency plans for getting the hell out if all hell broke loose, was Iraq
                        seen as a possible problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>TYSON: Not really, particularly at that time. If it was, it would've been sort of
                    an unintentional overspill. We were a bit of a distance from Iraq and, as I
                    said, Iraq was depending upon the Arabs for money and other support, so I think
                    the perception was that they would be unlikely to “slaughter the golden
                    goose.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Kuwait? What were you picking up from Saudis and

                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Kuwait was always the sort of odd man on the block. I mean, everybody
                    loved to hate the Kuwaitis and rarely had much nice to say about them. They,
                    from the time of independence, were noted because they had the Russian Embassy
                    others there and were always playing the ends against the middle and were seen
                    as very, very cautious of their own interests. At that time they sort of felt
                    that their own interests in that part of the world included a sort of genteelly
                    fashionable anti-Americanism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Eddy consular general? He was there for about a year

                </p>
                <p>TYSON: He was there for a year. I actually was “acting” for about four months and
                    then Brooks Wrampelmeier came in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've interviewed Brooks.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>What about relations with the Saudis; what was sort of the government, and how
                    did it operate from your perspective in the eastern province?</p>
                <p>TYSON: It was, in many ways, a new era there because?First of all, let me discuss
                    the government. The king's son, Prince Mohammed bin Fahd, who is still the emir
                    there, was newly appointed as the emir of the eastern province. It had been the
                    sort of historical birthright; it had been Jalawis for a long time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: His son, bin Jalawi.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>TYSON: And once or twice with Mr. Eddy and Mr. Wrampelmeier, we would call on the
                    former emir and the contrasts couldn't have been more striking. You'd go to the
                    new sort of emiri building or the government headquarters for the eastern
                    province, which was, you know, open atrium, glitzy marble, everything else, and
                    go in and you walk into Prince Mohammed's office and he has this huge desk which
                    is sort of inlaid Italian wood, quite ornate, obviously quite expensive. And
                    here's a man who had made, oh, a billion dollars reputedly on a telecom steal
                    and so forth, who spoke reasonably good English, was the next generation, and
                    fairly savvy about it. His vice emir was one of his cousins, Fahd bin Salman,
                    who actually died this past week; the son of the governor of Riyadh. So it was
                    more the young generation coming in. The head of the Saudi National Guard there
                    was Prince Mishari bin Saud, one of the youngest sons of old King Saud. With
                    Prince Mohammed and all, there was much more the newer generatiomore modern
                    Saudi Arabia. You'd go to the bin Jalawi palace and there would be these old
                    sort of Bedouin retainers with the cartridge belts draped?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Cross bandoliers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Cross bandoliers and the swords. It was literally stepping back into a
                    time, into a very, very different Arabia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you were there, was there a significant
                        American business or professional community there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: There was a very big community there. Actually, 1986 was quite an
                    interesting turning point because there had been the oil boom in '73 and just
                    rivers of money, and the eastern province and most of the kingdom was a huge
                    construction project. They built Jubail and the Envou, they put the gas
                    processing project in, the highways and this and that, and they were sort of
                    spreading the cash around to a lot of people doing that. And interestingly, in
                    '86 a lot of the projects were done, many of the contractors were leaving, and
                    oil prices were declining. So there was actually a contraction where for pricing
                    going up it had just been accepted. There was actually a little bit of a
                    deflation at that point. A lot of the ARAMCOMS and particularly the businessmen,
                    the contractors who depended on ARAMCO, and the government were saying, “Oh, in
                    a sense, it's sad that you missed the boom days.” Well, au contraire, most of
                    the stuff was built, most of it worked, many of the people had left so it wasn't
                    immensely crowded. Since I had a government salary and wasn't making part of the
                    contract, it was actually in some ways better.</p>
                <p>It was interesting because it was also forcing the Saudis to come to grip with
                    making choices as opposed to, “Let's just throw more money at it.”</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well tell me about your impression of how the Saudis were
                        dealing with sort of the problem of getting workers. My understanding is -
                        this is sort of way after my time, that they were getting people from
                        Indonesia, from the Philippines, from Korea, and would have Pakistanis
                        coming in, and the Saudis themselves weren't doing much outside of sort of
                        watching other people work.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: There had been a big change there. There's a slight difference among the
                    Shia, and I'll get into that. But, in a sense, there had been a lot that had
                    happened. In previous sessions I'd mentioned that I'd done something on the
                    foreign workers in Germany. The Germans are rank amateurs in comparison with
                    Arabs in terms of the purchase, use and consumption of foreign labor. Starting
                    with the hiring of Americans and Brits who tended to be at the upper end of the
                    food chain; I mean everything from investment bankers to doctors to whatever.
                    The name of the game was to explain to the Saudis what you wanted, and how much
                    you would pay them for a particular job. If you wanted a plumber, you wanted a
                    Filipino and he would be so many riyals per month. If you were actually looking
                    for an agronomist you wanted an Egyptian, particularly from Alexandria, at so
                    much, an accountant - a Lebanese Druze. They absolutely had it down as to which
                    nationality, what price. And there were huge differentials based on passport,
                    national background, race, and color, in terms of the salaries paid for what
                    might seem broadly similar work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were relations? The Saudis weren't making the mistakes
                        that the Kuwaitis had of letting a large Palestinian population come in. It
                        was different days, but they tend to settle there and cause problems shortly
                        thereafter. My understanding is the Saudis would let people come in, do
                        their thing, and then they'd leave. I mean there was no?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: That was the image. It wasn't always the reality and it certainly wasn't
                    the reality of ARAMCO with some of their other Arab hires, including
                    Palestinians - a number of whom had come out in the '40s or early '50s had
                    settled in there, had families there, had kids who grew up there, and eventually
                    were turfed out during the Gulf War. No, they didn't have the number of
                    Palestinians or other Arabs as a percentage of their overall population. I think
                    that had a lot to do with the money coming later. The Saudis would tend to
                    balance the sourcing of it; they'd become concerned if one group got too large,
                    or certain groups would have specialties. You know, the Koreans would come in to
                    do construction. The Filipinos would come in to do certain other things. But
                    even then the issue was coming up of personal maids and the abuses of the maids.
                    It was always out there. Obviously some families had servants for many years who
                    were members of the familvery well treated, well paid by their national
                    standards, who could go home. Others, the cases of abuse were real. Probably
                    very little was done about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you fin“you,” I'm talking about the people in
                        consular, but you yourself, too, were concerned about problems of Americans
                        who had troubles or let's say automobile accidents or alcohol abuse and then
                        the problems of Americans married to Saudis and with children who couldn't
                        get them out and all. I mean did this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: That's a whole series of problems that actually also elicited different
                    responses. Let me start with American women married to Saudis and the child
                    custody cases. That's much tougher. My wife actually got involved in escorting
                    an American woman whose husband had died back to Houston. There were the issues
                    of whether the spouse died and was the family trying to assert claim to it, or
                    was it a sort of nasty divorce and the husband didn't want the children to
                    leave. In the latter cases that could be difficult and, in a sense, what you
                    almost wanted was for the Saudi to take another wifstart another family, and
                    interestingly enough, I think effectively it was the second wife who would
                    basically say, “Get them out of here.” In a bizarre sort of way that would
                    help.</p>
                <p>The senior officials in the government would try to be helpful while of course
                    they had to uphold a lot of their own laws and standards. It would often tend to
                    be a very Arab solution of attempting to persuade people to let things go. Now
                    obviously one of the things that would be better is if the children were or were
                    nominally Muslim, they went to a place which had a mosque - Houston, Los
                    Angeles, New York, Washington; that's fine. Pocatello, Idaho becomes a bit more
                    problematic. There would be issues with that type of thing sometimes.</p>
                <p>The actual criminal caselet's take the alcohol; that type of thing. It could be
                    difficult when you get the situation of Americans being lashed or being put in
                    difficult circumstances in Saudi jails, particularly if they've got medical
                    issues. It really required a lot of intervention and assistance by the consular
                    officers who did incredible work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of things would you do? I mean, just say the
                        lashing; what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Very often with the lashing you try to keep the appeals going forward.
                    Sometimes the one in jail would eventually decide, “Let's just go through with
                    this and get it over so I can get out,” which in a sense was their choice. I
                    think in a lot of ways there were discreet interventions to try and deal with a
                    lot of these things.</p>
                <p>Auto accidents were much tougher. You'd hope under those circumstances that the
                    person's company had the financial reserves to basically pay blood money. One of
                    the first rules in the Middle East for any junior officer getting such a case
                    was, “You got a problem like that, get a suit on it quickly. Get someone in a
                    suit down there talking. Handle it. Get it done fast.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say “a suit,” would you explain what you
                        mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>TYSON: Basically a senior official in the embassy or the consulate who has got
                    some stature with the Saudis. You don't send a junior officer down.</p>
                <p>In another Middle Eastern post there was an attempted suicide involving an
                    American woman. The government basically did not want to deal with it, and the
                    embassy went in and said, “We're very well aware of this. You absolutely have
                    the right to do this under your laws, but it's difficult circumstances; here's
                    what the company and the family proposes. Let's have it happen.” She's on the
                    plane and out of there that evening.</p>
                <p>This was the bottom line for Americans. The Saudis didn't want the embarrassment
                    of a nasty dustup with problem Americans the way that they would with the
                    Filipinos. With Filipinos they would just shrug and say, “So what.” Filipino
                    problems often made the papers. The real punishment for a lot of transgressions
                    out there was loss of your job and income. You know, you've sweated away in the
                    desert on a rig, you're two years away from the ARAMCO pension and you get fired
                    up on seddiki or your kid does something or whatever, and the solution that many
                    people want, including the Saudis, and the companies, is that you're out of
                    there. That's it. You're over. In a sense, its much more than jail time or
                    criminal sanctions; that was the ultimate sanction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was true in my time, too. I might put in for somebody
                        who doesn't know - seddiki is a form of homemade liquor, usually made from
                        orange juice, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: It was made from any number of other things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When I went out they used to put out a booklet saying, “Be
                        very careful in doing this to orange juice because if you do this, and go
                        through here, it could end up like becoming alcohol,” and this was put out
                        because otherwise you had people experimenting and things would blow up and
                        so they didn't want things to blow up. So they put out a guide and I know my
                        wife couldn't go into the commissary, but asked for some yeast because she
                        wanted to make some bread. She got a five kilo loaf of brewer's yeast.</hi>

                <p>TYSON: Well, when we were there, you'd walk into the supermarkets downtown and
                    you'd go buy the bottles of Rausch grape juice, the Austrian grape juice, in
                    these bottles with the ceramic stoppers with the rubber gaskets. Right next to
                    it would be the bag of sugar, and right next to that would be the yeast. Just in
                    case you sort of forgot anything. But people were bringing in special wine
                    yeasts and there were actually wine tastings at some of the private compounds.
                    But sid was also actually brewed from straight grain and other alcohols; there
                    was sid white, which was sort of the straight run, or actually what you wanted
                    was the middle cut of the run, and then sid brown was more like a bourbon and
                    you got that by toasting your hickory chips on your charcoal grill and then
                    sitting the stuff on it for two weeks.</p>

                </p>
                <p>What abouI'm particularly thinking about Americans, but the problems of the
                    religious police. What were they called?</p>
                <p>TYSON: The Mutawa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there problems of people not observing, or running up
                        against, religious laws?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: The religious police, the Mutawa, were always something of an issue. First
                    of all, let's define this. In a way, in terms of the Wild West, I mean if you
                    could imagine something like fundamentalist vigilantes out on the town to
                    enforce order, that's probably about the best description of them. I have an
                    image of some puny little guy with a stick who would be nothing had he not
                    wrapped the veil of the Lord about him. It was always fairly interesting because
                    rumors would go around there, and there was a cycle of time that one had to be
                    aware of. We used to talk about this at businessmen's meetings. If Ramadan is
                    coming up, it's time to drop your jets, be a little more discreet, not quite so
                    loud; a little more aware of what's going on, and just to be somewhat more tuned
                    in to what's going on around you. It was interesting because my wife never wore
                    an abaya, and because she's a blue-eyed redhead and obviously a foreigner that
                    actually probably helped. The women who had the biggest problems were
                    African-American and/or MediterraneaItalian, Spanish, who could be Muslim. They
                    were much more likely to be approached in Arabic with, “Sister, cover your hair.
                    You're showing disrespect.” Well, obviously Susan was European or American. It
                    would come to the attention of the consulate. It was very useful to have a
                    consulate down there because I always thought that the emiri government was
                    looking for reasons to rein in the Mutawa, and the better your case was, the
                    happier they were.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>There was one famous story of the Mutawa going into some sort of western party.
                    They broke a whole bunch of imported crystal glasses, when actually there was no
                    liquor there; it was fruit juices and so forth. The emir called in the Mutawa,
                    offered them some orange juice, as it turns out, in crystal glasses. He asked
                    why they did it and the answer was, “Well you could drink wine in this,” and he
                    pointed out that, “Well, you're holding it and you're drinking orange juice. So
                    I think you'll be paying for those glasses.”</p>
                <p>The Mutawa also got into teenage boy stuff, which you'd find in the United
                    States, too. You get a bunch of teenage bucks out on the street and they
                    discover that they can go up and harass a foreigner who is their father's age. I
                    was out one day and sort of got a bunch of the young bucks looking around and I
                    didn't speak enough Arabic to really do that, but there was an Arab near me who
                    was sort of looking a little shaky about what might happen, and I just basically
                    said, “Tell them I'm from the consulate. Tell them I have the emir's phone
                    number in my wallet. Tell them that if anything happens, I'll see them there
                    with their father and grandfather.” And that was the end of it. It's teenage boy
                    stuff. That in a sense wasn't religion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about working on business - one of the problems has
                        always been to have sort of international commercial law meeting Sharia law.
                        Various commercial problems sometimes could get almost out of control, at
                        least in my time. Was this a problem for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: It wasn't so much Sharia per se, because in many ways you could thank
                    ARAMCO for that. I mean, in many ways as the absolute big dog on the hill there,
                    they had introduced and had contracting practices that were legal in the kingdom
                    - that would go forward. The biggest problem that was going on with most
                    commercial people was late payments at the timor no payments, delayed payments.
                    I think that your sharper Saudi dealers were using that as a way to say, “Well I
                    owe you a million riyals and I'm a year late and I can drag it out because I've
                    got most of the aces in the hole. What do you say if you just take 300,000 and
                    call it quits?” That works to a point, but then, as I used to point out to the
                    Saudis, what that means is that everybody builds that into their price if
                    they're smart. The money is going to be late, they're going to nick me on the
                    last payment, they're going to do this or that. ARAMCO and a few of the other
                    companies were really blue-chip in the way they did it, but some of the merchant
                    families or people who had gotten into it were playing those games. I think in
                    some cases they were getting second quality merchandise and stuff as a result of
                    it in the follow-on contracts, or they couldn't believe that someone would take
                    the settlement and then walk. And of course a lot of times it's not just the
                    building or the piece of equipment that you want, it's the follow-on support,
                    and when you've hacked them off, that support isn't going to be there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk about relations with ARAMCO and the consulate general
                        at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>TYSON: I was very well aware of the fact that basically the consulate was there
                    because of ARAMCO. I had said that I've done oil work and remember in the '70s
                    we used to get the ARAMCO magazine, and I'd leaf through it, figuring, “My, this
                    is exotic.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ARAMCO World?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: ARAMCO World. I'll never go there. Foolish me. It was fascinating for what
                    it was as an entity - a huge enterprise. Quite an American company and this was
                    the twilight of the American management. The shift over occurred while I was
                    there; John Kelber went out and Ali I. Al-Naimi came in as president. This was
                    the real Saudiization of ARAMCO.</p>
                <p>There were always a series of incidents, and I think one of the most important
                    things, actually on both sides, on the ARAMCO on the one side and the consulate
                    on the other, was to maintain a civil and a productive working relationship. I
                    had my counter-part at ARAMCO government relations; it was headed by Abdullah S.
                    Jum'ah and there was Harry Alter there, and then David Bosch who is now at the
                    Saudi ARAMCO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Harry Alter was a brand new officer when I was there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Well he was much more senior when I was there. (laughs) Harry and Abdullah
                    Jum'ah dealt with Mr. Eddy and I tended to deal with David who was also
                    president of the American Businessmen's Association. This issues that came about
                    the consulate was access to some of our entertainment facilities and other
                    things that we had. And how shall I best put this? I tended to take a somewhat
                    more liberal attitude towards this than Mr. Eddy did, so David and I tended to
                    get along. It was one of these things where every now and then in this business
                    you are given a contact and in a sense it's up to you to make that relationship
                    work. David and I are still friends, although it's, “There you are. You're each
                    other's counterpart.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did the consulate have that ARAMCO didn't have;
                        anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Basically liquor and a number of other things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a school there when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: We had the school on the compound.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that work? Was that a problem for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>TYSON: I managed by and large to avoid many of the problems as a bachelor and
                    then a newly married person without children. Stuff would come up with the
                    school. I think in smaller places people tend to get very, very well wound-up
                    about them. There were certain discipline issues; there were some allegations of
                    some drugs at school. I remember butting heads with Mr. Eddy about a new school
                    policy that was fairly Draconian; I don't remember it in retrospect, but it
                    struck me at the time that if someone mentions your child might have been
                    involved with drugs then they were summarily expelled. This sort of offended me
                    as the lawyer. As it turned out, this policy was put through and two of the
                    first kids to get nailed were reasonably senior children. I won't go into who
                    they were, but they were reasonably senior children. It was just very tough as
                    far as that goes. These schools are important, but they take up a lot of
                    consulate time out there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about relations with the Saudi military, and did we
                        have any American military there at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: We had the United States Training Mission (USTM) out at the airbase. Up in
                    Riyadh there was OPM-SANG, which was the Saudi-Arabia National Guard
                    Modernization Program which I think was the Vinnell Corporation. It also had a
                    U.S. army one or two-star general with that. We had a United States Training
                    Mission naval support unit up at the port at Jubail. There was a fairly heavy
                    military presence; they had the F-16s and a number of other things. We were
                    selling them a lot of equipment so there was probably a much larger presence
                    than in your time. The Saudis controlled the base, but there was a small U.S.
                    commissary and things like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it still - you had the National Guard or what was
                        sometimes called the White Army, and the sort of the regular Saudi army and
                        sort of made to make sure that one didn't get too strong or something like
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: That very much struck me; the regular Saudi army definitely struck me as
                    the runt in the litter as compared to the air force and even to some degree the
                    navy. I think the Saudi Arabian National Guard which was much more historically
                    the personal retainers of the Al Saud drawn from their Bedouin support base.
                    They were putting a lot of money into modernizing that. As I said, Prince
                    Mishari bin Saud was the head of the eastern province, and of course Prince
                    Abdullah, who is now Crown Prince Abdullah - that was always pretty much his
                    baby, too. So it always played an important role there.</p>

                    been some distant tie, but I basically think not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But basically he was not part of that group. Were American

                <p>TYSON: Oh, you mean all the snake oil salesmen, the descendants of the ones who
                    did the Indians in Oklahoma in the 1920s? Oh, they were all there - some with
                    decent products, others with things that were little more than scams. For a long
                    time that was the get-rich-quick, get out here, make a sale, get huge
                    commissions, and go rolling back home. As I say, it was starting to tail off by
                    '86.</p>

                <p>TYSON: Interestingly enough, what we got was more inquiries about families like
                    the Algosaibis and stuff. I ended up supervising the commercial section for a
                    while and there's the World Trade Data Report which Commerce sold, and we'd get
                    inquiries about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's one of the big merchant families.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: It's a huge merchant family which has got Citibank as one of their
                    clients. If they want to run a “Dunn &amp; Bradstreet” on someone, they'll do it
                    in New York or London. The level of sophistication that the money had bought to
                    the big families was considerable. I knew the Connus, the merchant family, and
                    the Bin Zagrs among others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Connus were also in Bahrain at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Yes. Bahrain and the UAE (United Arab Emirates). These people are about as
                    sophisticated as you'll find here, and were big enough, and were it serious
                    enough, they'd run the checks in Europe or back here.</p>

                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Yes, pretty much Jeddah-based. They did some stuff in the eastern
                    province. Bin Zagrs were also Jeddah-based, but Muhammad Bin Zagr was like the
                    New England family that sends the son out to California to open the operation.
                    There was a bit of that in the eastern province on some of the projects.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the riots in Mecca in '87.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: In the summer of '87 Ned Walker was the charg�, Anne Patterson was the
                    acting DCM, and I was the acting principal officer in Dhahran. It was generally
                    thought that these riots were inspired by the Iranians as a test of the
                    governing ability of the Al Saud. It was an interesting time because I'd gone up
                    to Riyadh to country team and I met with Ned who later had a number of
                    ambassadorships and was NEA assistant secretary. Mr. Eddy had left. Mr. Eddy was
                    always extremely careful about interviewing the Saudis; one looked for subtle
                    nuances, body language, intimations or hints that this might be this or that,
                    but you couldn't ask a lot of stuff. Frankly, I looked at Ned Walker and said,
                    “I thought we could ask a lot more. I thought they had a new generation in
                    there.” And while, in a sense, it was risky, we're playing these Kabuki shadow
                    games and what does the shadow on the wall mean? He basically said, “Well, go
                    for it,” so I went in to Prince Muhammad, Prince Fahd, Prince Mishari, and a
                    number of others and basically started asking questions like, “How did you get
                    your job?” “What do you think about the situation with Iran?” “What do you think
                    of the Shia?” Big questions. I just walked in and said, “I've been instructed by
                    Washington to ask you the following.” I had ten questions and I'd get nine out
                    of ten. It was just phenomenal; they answered it. You know, the sky didn't fall;
                    it was, “Wow, okay fine.”</p>
                <p>The other thing that went on at this time was Dhahran's a consulate and the move
                    to Riyadh had occurred and the embassy was there. Walter Cutler was the
                    ambassador when I first got there and I remember going to the Embassy at
                    Christmas. The ambassador had a party for the staff and someone had said, “Oh,
                    yes, you'll have to come and meet 'C and C'.” I went, “'C and C' what's that?”
                    and it was carrots and celery and it referred to Mrs. Cutler because that's what
                    she tended to serve. I was going there with someone because we were just up in
                    Riyadh for the country team and they basically said, “We'll have reservations
                    for dinner afterwards.” It was sort of interesting because Senator Percy, who
                    was out of office at that time, was there. Cutler was pleasant enough and
                    competent enough and everything else, but Mrs. Cutler, who is quite a talented
                    photographer, came down to Dhahran on a visit with her husband and Mrs. Eddy. My
                    wife, Susan, and I, went off on the women's program and all I can say about Mrs.
                    Cutler is that she treated my wife dreadfully and my wife has never forgotten
                    it.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the background of your wife and then could you
                        talk about how she adjusted to Dhahran?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: I think you'd best ask her sometime and get her for that.</p>
                <p>She had been working on Capitol Hill on House appropriations and Senate
                    appropriations. Then one weekend she marries a Foreign Service Officer and goes
                    off to Saudi Arabia - comes out there, gets pregnant, comes back, has our son in
                    Maryland, and comes back with the first son for three months before we leave
                    Arabia. So it was quite a whirlwind. I would not presume to speak for her. I
                    think she should have her own interview.</p>
                <p>We also had Hume Horan and the Chinese missiles incident. Horan came iincredible
                    Arabic and very, very interested in the country. Nancy Horan was wonderful. She
                    came out for a visit to the eastern province with her sister and brother-in-law.
                    Everything was going along very well and then the whole Chinese missiles thing
                    happened and then Horan was pulled and Cutler came back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we view the presence of a significant Shia
                        population in the eastern province? Was that considered to be destabilizing
                        or?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: I think there were people who thought that it would be destabilizing,
                    certainly the Saudis were historically concerned about it. And of course one of
                    the roles of the consulate was to report on that. Actually one of the more
                    interesting things that I set up for Ambassador Cutler one time when he came
                    down was a luncheon and some meetings with what we referred to as the “Shia
                    notables.” David Hale, who is now DCM in Beirut and is about to come back here,
                    did a great deal of contact work with the Shia when I first got there. He moved
                    on to Bahrain. I sort of inherited it and continued the contacts.</p>
                <p>There was an American, Jack Coley, out of ARAMCO. Mr. Clinton Jack Coley, Jr. of
                    Alexander City, Alabama, who had come out to work at ARAMCO and actually, God
                    love him, made a real effort to introduce newly arrived people at the consulate
                    to other people and to Saudis. Some of my first contacts with the Shia community
                    were courtesy of Jack; he had asked me to come along to the wedding of someone
                    he knew, Muhammad Al Dhamin, who just died this past weemay he rest in peace,
                    who actually turned out to be a delightful man and a very good friend. But it's
                    like a small village anywhere; you come to be known to people and you're known
                    as the friend of someone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Taif, was it, maybe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: It was Tarut Island. Katif and Tarut.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean Katif, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: And then we also had contacts in Al Hasa in Hofuf, which was between
                    Dhahran and Riyadh. Susan came out two months into it my tour. My Shia friends
                    and their wives wanted to meet her, so I took her up to Tarut Island and went to
                    Muhammad's house. She was with the women and I was with the men. She came back
                    and was at some sort of women's function in ARAMCO and announced that she had
                    been to Tarut the last weekend, it was the equivalent of venturing into the
                    depths of Harlem or Anacostia.</p>
                <p>When Susan came back with David, it turns out I was the acting principal officer.
                    It turned out that a lot of the Saudi women wanted to see the baby, so what we
                    did is Susan and the baby and some of our consulate female staffers were at our
                    house and I was up at the big house receiving the men. So there was a lot of
                    that convoluted socializing, but she'd done it all; she'd gotten married and
                    then she'd produced the heir. (laughs)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left in '88? Whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: USUN [United States Mission to the United Nations], New York, via a
                    conference in Geneva. I was working on the Economic and Social Affairs Committee
                    for Harry Cahill. I ended up doing Third-World debt negotiations at the United
                    Nations and a lot of other economic issues. I ended up doing one of these 113 to
                    1 votes with the U.S. voting against a debt resolution. It was fairly
                    interesting, but what colored everything in New York was the change in the
                    housing regulations. Before, in order to get people into New York they'd provide
                    you an apartment, they'd take 5% of your salary and that was that. It rapidly
                    changed to they took 20% of your salary, you had to pay utilities, you were also
                    paying for parking up at the UN, but then the difference between what you paid
                    and the cost of the apartment was added to your salary for tax purposed. So you
                    were getting absolutely hammered. It was just a major, major disincentive to
                    recruiting for USUN, and it was one of those matters that the Department did
                    little to resolve. I think still has done very little. The UN assignment was
                    fascinating because I think the rest of the world takes the UN much more
                    seriously than we do. I thought at the time that in the future I'd be writing
                    notes of congratulations to the foreign diplomats I worked with when they were
                    appointed to ambassadorships or senior positions in their government. Indeed
                    that's been true. We also had a much more rapid turnover of people, so you're
                    coming up against folks who have done negotiations five or six times and you're
                    the new kid on the block and it's somewhat easier to roll you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well you were doing this from '88 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>TYSON: '89 because of the housing program. First of all, it took them two months
                    to get us into an apartment and we were in a horrendous hotel. I don't think
                    that the staff up there had bothered to check out hotels because it became
                    rapidly clear to me that there were other options. We're there with a child;
                    it's a hotel with no laundry facilities and stuff like this. It was just
                    dreadful. This was one of the first intimations of the real split that
                    occasionally is discussed between the Foreign Service and the Civil Service.
                    You've got the New York civil servants with, “What are you complaining about?
                    God, you guys are just used to everything!” and it was really difficult. I think
                    it showed up in terms of their difficulties in recruiting. We were told that the
                    Department was going to break the lease and move us. We basically said, “You
                    know what; a move is a move.” Susan had her old job in Washington lined up and
                    we figured we'd be punished by being sent back to Washington, which was fine. So
                    we were planning on doing that and I got a call out of the blue saying, “Someone
                    had lined up the Energy job in London, but they're going to drop out of it.
                    Would you be interested in it?” And I said, “Yes, go ahead and work it, but just
                    before it's a reality, call me because I'm 90 percent certain that it'll be
                    fine, but I'll want to ask my wife.” So that went forward for about ten days.
                    We're going to be moved out of the NY apartment. What are we going to do? Susan
                    is stressed out; she's newly pregnant. So I get the call offering me the London
                    posting and said, “Give me five minutes.” So I picked up the phone and said to
                    her, “What would you think of London?” and she said, “Do not toy with me,” and I
                    said, “I'm not, it's real. We can have it. I need to give them an answer.” She
                    said, “Go for it.” So I called back and said, “We'll take London.” Pure stupid,
                    blind, dumb luck.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we move on during this '88, '89 period, this
                        would've been the end of the Reagan period, was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When Reagan and his group came in, they came out of the
                        anti-UN culture and one of the American UN ambassadors practically saying,
                        “We'd be delighted to have you all leave the United States,” and all this.
                        But usually an administration goes through a maturization process. How did
                        you find it at the end?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: At the end it had sort of more than settled down. Reagan had come up any
                    number of other times and the man was an incredible actor. He would come in, he
                    knew how to work a crowd, including at the UN. Nancy was always immaculate. They
                    also took the time, and I must absolutely give them points for coming in to talk
                    to the USUN staff, which was very nice. General Walters was still there as the
                    perm rep. (permanent representative). Herb Okun was the deputy and then there
                    were a series of other ambassadors. Walters left and Tom Pickering ended up
                    coming in. Reagan was very good and, remember, too, at this point, that Maureen
                    Reagan had been U.S. representative to a major women's conference.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TYSON: At that point they certainly knew what the UN was and what it did. The
                    people surrounding the Reagans always scripted them very well. This was the
                    seventh or eighth time they'd come up for a UNGA (United Nations General
                    Assembly). They pretty much had the drill down.</p>

                <p>TYSON: Third-World debt reduction.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what was the American stance on that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Oh utterly opposed to the rest of the world. We were not particularly
                    interested in official debt forgiveness, even though we had written off a bunch
                    of stuff in Africa. I think in many ways we saw it as just a huge give-away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our banks doing because they were the ones
                        giving out the money, weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: What had happened is that the Brady Plan had given the banks a period of
                    years to write down bad loans. I used to point out to other countries that in
                    essence the American taxpayer had paid for a lot of these in foregone taxes. The
                    most striking example, and you know we weren't totally consistent in our
                    policies was the issue of Mexican debt relief. Mexico had the absolute luxury of
                    leftist rhetoric and a telex into the U.S. Treasury. I was at a lunch near the
                    end of the session at the Tunisian Residence and the Mexican delegate who was
                    sort of fun, but he's got his positions, I've got mine, was egging me on, “Why
                    isn't America doing this and that?” Many delegates of African countries are
                    standing around with wide-eyes listening to this. I said, “Oh Victor, please.
                    You know that if your president calls my president and says, 'We need five
                    billion and we want it tomorrow in Juarez,' we're going to say, 'That's
                    impossible. It'll have to be four billion in El Paso.'" As it turns out, three
                    days later we made a huge loan to Mexico on essentially those terms. Later all
                    the African delegates came around to say, “Oh you were right. You were
                    right.”</p>

                <p>The Europeans were sort of playing a dodging gamwanting to get a lot of political
                    capital and looking for the Americans to be the stumbling block and to take the
                    big bad falnot so much on debt, but on one or two other issues. I got
                    instructions from Washington that said I could follow a European consensus, but
                    I was not to lead it. The Europeans came in convinced that, “Well, the Americans
                    would say no, they'd abstain, and that would be that,” and I showed them the
                    instructions which was basically saying, “You want it to go away; you have to
                    make it go away.” Oh boy, that shoe pinched.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wonderinthe thing that's always disturbed me about
                        these debt reductions, you know countries saying they can't pay it, I would
                        think that would be almost a one-shot thing, because if you lend money to a
                        person and they can't pay it, they say, “Oh that's too bad,” but you don't
                        lend it again.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Well in a sense this is what was going to happen. Debt reduction or some
                    sort of buy-out was going to be an exit strategy out of a whole lot of
                    countries. This was a different era. The banks were not going to be interested
                    in essentially of the slate of 100 countries, there were about 12 that they were
                    seriously interested in. For a lot of the rest, it would be, “Thank you for
                    settling up this account. We're closing our representational office. Have a
                    great life. Have a great national destiny.” And I think a lot of the other
                    countries didn't get that. They assumed that the minute that debt reduction was
                    agreed to, the spigots would re-open. That wasn't going to be the case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that on debt reduction and things like that,
                        did we have any support; I mean, say the Brits or somebody?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Not particularly on that. As I said, it was 113 to 1. On other issues we
                    would, but that was also, I think, the beginning of a great deal of resentment
                    against the United States for out non-payment or delayed payment of dues. I mean
                    there was just a very, very strong and underlying resentment about that. I think
                    that resentment has been shown recently in terms of being voted off committees
                    and a number of other things about Israel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was our close relation to Israel a factor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Yes, but that was much more the work of the political section. We'd
                    occasionally get into Israeli matters and the occupied territories on some of
                    the other committees. But yes, Israel was certainly a factor, but this was
                    equally true of our views on North Korea and some other pariah states. There are
                    times when others are quite happy to hide behind our skirts, but there are other
                    times where we had well-known and strong views on things.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was China a factor at all - as a player really?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Oh, yes. My Chinese counterpart was mission-educated and quite urbane.
                    China, in a sense, had the luxury of sort of being part of the G-77, but also
                    larger and more than that since they had the veto. The Chinese could be useful
                    brokers of compromise at various points. If China suddenly saw middle ground it
                    was often quite astounding as to who they could bring along. I think what was
                    also striking was a lot of very small countries; you definitely got the
                    impression that they had wide latitude and really were probably not reporting a
                    great deal back to their home country or getting instructions.</p>
                <p>The Scandinavians always had a phrase; one of my friends used to put it, “You're
                    authorized to join a consensus with like-minded countries,” which unfortunately
                    did not often include the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about France; in your dealings, how did you see their
                        role?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>TYSON: In working with the French including those at the UN, I had a 50-50 rule.
                    About half of the French diplomats that I've met are pretty savvy, sophisticated
                    people that you can work with and probably like and then you get another half
                    that is just gratuitously snide and nasty to Americans for the sake of doing
                    ipreferably in public in front of others. During the time that I was there, the
                    first French representative fell into the definitely nasty category, and then he
                    was replaced by a much more reasonable woman who was willing to deal, which was
                    fine. But with the former, with the really nasty one, as it turned out, one of
                    the best things was one day there was a new smart German representative whose
                    English actually was somewhat weak. There also was a Colombian delegate, an
                    Egyptian woman delegate who played a very, very key role, a South African
                    delegate, and me, and as it turned out we all spoke German. So the nasty French
                    delegate goes by and he sees the American speaking German, dealing in a foreign
                    language, and then he comes up to me and he starts speaking in French and I say,
                    “I'm sorry, I don't speak French.” I mean it's obvious I speak a foreign
                    language; it's not French. There would occasionally be this sort of nasty shots.
                    But that's one of those things, whether it's the French or others, you do it at
                    your peril. The day will come when you need something from ma bit of
                    information, something about a visa, this or that. Now, I can be nice or I can
                    be very correct. It's your choice. It's funny how you can get that message
                    across. People actually remarked upon this incident with the nasty person which
                    had been observed by others who had seen me stiff-arm the other guy; his
                    successor was just much more reasonable. She was going to pursue French
                    interests. Fine. But she wasn't going to be gratuitously nasty about it and that
                    was also fine. The other thing is, once again, as I've pointed out to the
                    French, it's really de Gaulle who did it; they're still paying for de Gaulle's
                    behavior. Coming up in elementary school, you know, you're coloring pictures of
                    the Bonhomme Richard, the Marquis de Lafayette, Ben Franklin in Paris, Pershing
                    in France. Everything was there; it was the complete lay down of French-American
                    relations, and then de Gaulle comes along when the reality is, in terms of
                    policy terms, if you're doing something where you want to punish the European
                    Union, and the bulk of the punishment is for the French, you can probably sell
                    it quite easily in Washington. You can certainly sell it in Heartland,
                    America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're absolutely right. It's gratuitous because we're
                        trained to have an affinity with France.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>TYSON: Well the history is there. You know, part of my father's family is
                    French-Huguenot. I mean we've got the DuPonts in Delaware. We've got the history
                    going back and forth. Two world wars. But de Gaulle, and this is something that
                    I have pointed out to other countries - watch it when the Americans stop arguing
                    with you. When you are so minimal that you are not even worth arguing with, you
                    need to worry about us, because we don't care. And I mean, the gratuitous thing
                    is to look wide-eyed as the French come up to you and complain that they weren't
                    consulted and you just do this stupid American thing of, “But we talked to the
                    Japanese and the Germans and Brits and all the important countries.” You know,
                    just hit the launch button and launch. That said, on the other hand, about half
                    of the French diplomats that I've worked with in different locations over the
                    years, were very civil, very cooperative - certainly the French military in the
                    Sinathe pilots and all were very good. I think France, to this day, is still
                    paying for the legacy of de Gaulle.</p>

                        shook in a way, but you're off to London.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: I'm off to London.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: '89 to '93. Leaving New York - I cannot emphasis just how difficult that
                    year and the whole administrative mess was for me and others. We got on that
                    plane and we were so happy to get to London.</p>
                <p>We were in a temporary apartment in a building that's actually at Number 1 Abbey
                    Road in London. We got there in late August. It was actually very cute; you'd go
                    out and you'd see all the Japanese tourists in the crosswalks from the Abbey
                    Road album. And you'd be walking around the neighborhood and disoriented people
                    would have disoriented maps and some Japanese tourist or German would
                    tentatively approach you and ask for directions. And it was really terribly
                    sweet. We were two doors down from the EMI recording studios. We were there for
                    about three weeks and then we moved into our townhouse just north of Hyde Park,
                    and started settling in. As I said, Susan was pregnant with our daughter.</p>
                <p>London was just nice. It was a big embassy. I was working for Anne Berry, the
                    economic counselor. Henry Catto was the ambassador. I liked my job, liked the
                    work, the house was nice; everything in many ways was just rolling along. It was
                    just one of those things: nice place, nice assignment, a particular time in your
                    life.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>I loved doing the oil work. '89 also brought cataclysmic changes in oil. For
                    years we'd been looking at Eastern Europe and Russia, particularly the oil
                    fields, and guesstimating that, “Well it probably has this or that.” All of a
                    sudden all of these Russians are coming up to conferences in London and doing
                    presentations on the Timan Oil Fields or other matters. You know, you're
                    standing there saying to someone, having read the briefing materials on it,
                    “Well, if you're looking at a billion barrels,” and they'd look at you and go,
                    “Fivfive billion.” So I mean there were just these little bits and pieces of
                    fascinating information. It was a wonderful reporting job because there was just
                    a lot happening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were the petroleum officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Energy officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Energy officer. What did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Basically followed North Sea developments. This was also a time when the
                    British were privatizing their electric industry and I reported on that. If they
                    ever pulled it up, the California government should have read about power-pool
                    pricing. There was a lot of stuff that was aggressively happening in England
                    that was ahead of what the States was doing. They had a huge commercial presence
                    in both the Norwegian and British sectors of the North Sea. But London is also a
                    wonderful listening post for the world oil industrbetter than Houston because
                    it's Russia, it's Africa, it's Asia. You go to these conferences up at Oxford. I
                    was doing stuff on off-shore Vietnam; any number of things. I would also arrange
                    for dignitaries to visit the four big companies: BP (British Petroleum), Shell,
                    British Gas which was becoming a major international player, and British Coal
                    which was government-owned and was undergoing a lot of restructuring and mines
                    closures. We had American companies operating there, but if they want to talk to
                    Exxon, they can talk to Exxon in the States. So I'd end up sitting in on some of
                    these “whither the world” sessions with senior American officials. I also
                    consulted on the Middle East with some of Shell and BP's Middle East experts. It
                    was fairly interestinnew people in the oil trading community, and I was doing
                    stuff like off-shore oil safety issues. There's a broad range of things,
                    including power.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the breaking down of the Iron Curtain and Germany
                        joining and all - did that make much of an energy difference or a
                        challenge?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>TYSON: Yes it did because a lot of assets in Eastern Europe were suddenly
                    up-for-grabs: refineries in East Germany, pipelines, any number of other things.
                    And then of course you had the companies interested in going in to look for
                    prospects. So it really changed. The reunification was actually harkening back
                    to the UN. I honestly think that certain people - including the Thatcher
                    government in the UK and probably the French, were less than thrilled with the
                    prospect of German reunification.</p>
                <p>I'm not sure exactly when, but we had a reception in the atrium of the embassy
                    and a German diplomat from their embassy in London was chatting with me and we
                    were speaking in German; he basically said, “Well, what is the U.S. view on
                    reunification?” And I said, “The same as it's been for a long time. We support
                    it. We want to see Germany within NATO,” and there was this sort of smile and
                    “Thank you very much.” I think there are people in Europe who would've been
                    happy to see America be the bully-boy, but when it became clear that we weren't
                    going to do that, that to stop it they would have to stand up and be counted,
                    they weren't willing to do that. Reunification went forward.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see both the reunification of Germany and were you
                        getting reports about all these facilities that were available in Eastern
                        Europe? Were sub-standard a problem; I mean, was this going to be a huge
                        re-doing job or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Oh, yes, the environmental impact and cleanup was going to be huge. There
                    was a lot of concern about the nuclear plants. Remember, too, that it was an
                    interesting time to be in Britain, particularly that fall because it was the
                    anniversary of the start of World War II, and the very time Germany is
                    reunifying. And of course the beginning of that war is all over the television
                    and so forth; they had the newscasters reading the news from that era as though
                    it were today. I mean it was just in-your-face. So the combination of what's
                    happening in Berlin and the reality of what had happened was just all there. So
                    it was quite an exciting time to be in Europe.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By this time, was Thatcher still in, or??</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Thatcher was still in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was sort of our attitude towards Thatcherism, vis a
                        vis the British economy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: At that point Thatcher was punching through a lot of real reforms, and as
                    I said, in my little area, if anything, they were further along or more
                    aggressively free-market or privatized than the U.S. was. Also remember that
                    there was that great love feast going on between Thatcher and Reagan - and then
                    Bush. She just always had this rapport, starting at the White House. That was a
                    real reality.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Somebody I interviewed that was in the White House at the
                        time said they used to get very nervous when Margaret Thatcher came to the
                        White House - and also Brian Mulroney, because they didn't like to see
                        Ronald Reagan alone in the room with them because God knows what might come
                        out of that as far as agreements and all this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Yes. Well I think Thatcher, of course, the iron lady with her handbag, was
                    one hell of a politician and personality. What was becoming clear though, was
                    that Thatcher was probably more popular outside the UK than she was in. Like
                    Nixon and Reagan were also more popular outside the U.S. The Tory Party
                    historically has had a tendency to eat its own young and I think the downfall of
                    Thatcher, which was hard for many Americans to understand given the
                    parliamentary system, was very real. It was funny because we had actually had
                    John Major into the embassy three weeks before he became prime minister. And I
                    mean for us Major initially was viewed as, “Who is this Brixton-born nothing who
                    is coming along?” You know, this someone who had gone off to make some money
                    doing banking in Nigeria or something like that, but then he really came
                    along.</p>
                <p>The ambassador used to have people in for breakfast?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: This was Henry Catto. He used to have personalities in for a breakfast and
                    then they'd join in an expanded country team meeting. I remember the Major
                    breakfast because the night before my boss called me to plant a question on
                    agricultural policjust to make sure it wasn't a total dud. He was actually quite
                    engaging in person. I had also seen Thatcher when I helped escort Vice President
                    Quayle out to Checkers during a visit that he made. A much shorter woman than
                    one would've expected.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The great confrontation - the great battle of Western
                        Europe, was when Thatcher confronted the miners under - was it Cargill or
                        Scargill?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Arthur Scargill.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Scargill. It looked very dubious. This was a little before
                        you got out there. This basically was the breaking of the power of the
                        unions. Was there a feeling energy-wise that things were looking
                        better?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>TYSON: Not necessarily better; things were changing and indeed the National Union
                    of Miners did have a lot to say while I was there. The issue was privatizing
                    coal and then even before that as a run-up to it, a lot of what they call “pit
                    closures.” It's hard to really describyou almost need sort of like a black and
                    white 1960s Rita Tushingham film of how these local towns and these mines are
                    all bound up with each other; that's your life and your father did it and you'll
                    do it, too. If you're one of the local lassies, you'll marry one of the miners,
                    and stuff like that. And then they're going to close the pit and what do you do
                    because there's nothing but that.</p>
                <p>I did Wales which had a development commission which was trying to attract newer
                    and lighter industry with some success. But the pit closures in certain areas
                    were just devastating, and we had miners' marches in London. Michael Heseltine
                    got involved in some of the face-offs in parliament there. Scargill, in a sense,
                    was past its peak, but there were still some very real issues there: would they
                    go for nuclear power, would they go for gas-fired powehow would they be doing
                    that. They were also importing coal from a number of places. We exported
                    metallurgical coal, some steam coal. They were beginning to look into bringing
                    in Colombian coal, South African coal, which is often strip-mined and just
                    cheaper.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the attitude of our government towards nuclear
                        power at that point; that you were getting reflected from your principals
                        back in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Nuclear power at that point had essentially stalled after Three-Mile
                    Island. The nuclear issue that tended to come up was much more waste storage.
                    The Yucca Mountain in Nevada. And then the Brits were doing nuclear reprocessing
                    in Celafield and elsewhere, and the shipments of nuclear waste from Japan to
                    Britain, and back and forth, were issues. We were tending to follow some of the
                    choices that Britain was making, but there really weren't any new plants being
                    built in the U.S. France was going gang-busters on nuclear energy. So in many
                    ways, I think if you're looking for practical experience on building and
                    operating nuclear plants these days, it's in France, Germany, Japan, South
                    Korea, and elsewhere; not in the States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there during the Chernobyl business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Yes, must've been.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering if this put a damper on things.</hi>

                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>TYSON: Well, it caused a lot of concern, but this issue concerned the safety of
                    facilities in Eastern Europe. Chernobyl threw the spotlight on all of those
                    types of reactors in Eastern Europe and Bulgaria and elsewhere, where it was not
                    only the issue of a deteriorating physical plant but the lack of a corporate
                    culture of safety. Did they have a safety culture? And in many ways they didn't.
                    People who were going into these plants were just horrified at what they
                    saw.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we find ourselves at odds with the energy community
                        that you were dealing with over in Libya at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: What an interesting description. Yes and no. Yes, in that actually I dealt
                    with the UK branches of some of the American companies that had interests in
                    Libya, such as Marathon and others that were part of the Oasis Group. No, in
                    that any time the U.S. had sanctions, European companies - particularly some of
                    the smaller ones, saw that as an opportunity to get in. All other things being
                    equal, they wouldn't be at the high table. The minute you knock out or keep out
                    the Americans, they've got a shot. Libya was one; you had the Austrians and
                    others going in there. Vietnam at that time was another. You had British
                    companies in there off-shore when Americans weren't. I used to meet with the
                    British companies who'd say, “My God, I hope you're continuing your sanctions.”
                    So it was much more like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see, by this time, a change in the energy culture?
                        One thinks of the earlier years as OPEC versus the consumer, and all this.
                        From your vantage point in London - which is always a good place to have a
                        vantage point, was there a coming together - a more rational approach on
                        energy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Not particularly. I did a lot of OPEC watching and meeting with OPEC
                    officials. Of course a lot of it goes on in Vienna, but they'd come through
                    London. I'd do reports on that. OPEC politics was a big staple as was curiosity
                    about what Iran was doing. I had a timeline of the OPEC meetings and I'd step
                    stuff back three to four weeks; you know, do the round of usual suspects of,
                    “Well, what do you think is going to happen?” throw together a cable, address it
                    to the world, get other people referencing me; that's how I was a player in
                    energy policy.</p>
                <p>There was always an ambivalence about producer-consumer dialogues and quota or
                    price-fixing coming up, so we'd always dance around that, as would OPEC. There
                    were also certain institutions like the Oxford Energy Seminar and other events
                    in London that were off the record where you got senior officials from both
                    sides with an opportunity to talk about whatever they wanted to discuss, off the
                    record or in reasonably private circumstances. But in terms of a great
                    coming-together and meeting of minds, not particularly.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did other nations - the Germans, the Japanese, have their
                        own energy watcher in London, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Actually, interestingly enough, with the Japanese it was much more the
                    companies that had traders in the city. I think the Germans and others tended to
                    follow more the IEA in Paris. But I used to meet with, and brief the Japanese
                    fairly regularly; I did it with my counterpart who was doing the Middle East
                    watching type of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm trying to pick up the nuances of diplomacy. What was
                        in it for you to brief the Japanese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Information.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They would give you information on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Sure, on Asia. Or what they're hearing in the market. In any number of
                    things. In the first place, the Japanese tend to be very interesting. If you get
                    to the poor, shy, little chrysanthemum flower fairly early on you basically say,
                    “Look, I know who you guys are. I know how competent you are. Fair is fair. If
                    we're talking about things, it's not a one-way street. I'm going to have some
                    questions or issues for you.” There were things like the Japanese concessions in
                    Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, what they were looking at in China, whether they had
                    anything on North Korea - certainly Vietnam, what they were looking at in terms
                    of the world gas business with LNG and stuff. You know, one just never knew.
                    There would be different topics. They're out there, too; they're talking to
                    other people and two or three of them were fairly knowledgeable observers that I
                    found very good value iand probably vice-versa, which is why we continued to see
                    each other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you were there '89 to '93, so you were there when
                        Iraq invaded Kuwait. How did that play when you were there? Did this come as
                        a shock to everybody or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>TYSON: Actually yes. To back up, my daughter had been born in February of 1990,
                    and we're there and my job is going along. The summer of '90 there's a rattling
                    of sabers with Iraq and I think a lot of “knowledgeable Middle Eastern
                    observers” just basically figured that this was another effort to shake the
                    piggy bank to get some cash out. There was a feeling that, “Well maybe Iraq
                    might do something like take Warba and Bubiyan, the two islands, and/or a little
                    bit of a strip,” or, you know, “It could be difficult, but basically
                    bottom-line, Saddam wanted cash.” I mean, he had a river of money, the war
                    ended, and the river ended, and he didn't like it. So this is all fine and good.
                    The saber rattling is going on and one particular evening my new daughter - she
                    was just a baby, was up and cranky so my wife and I were juggling this back and
                    forth. I don't look at a paper, don't look at anything, get to work, and Walt
                    Lockwood, my boss, says, “What do you think?” I said, “About what?” He said,
                    “Iraq invaded Kuwait last night,” and I said, “I think my work requirements have
                    just changed.” In fairly short order, this is just shocking and of course a lot
                    of the Kuwaitis are in Europe. What does it all mean? Are the Iraqis going to go
                    into Saudi Arabia?” You know, we've got friends in ARAMCO and stuff like this.
                    So everybody is very spun up. It's an adrenaline rush at the embassy.</p>
                <p>Also in fairly rapid order - I don't know whether we were between Middle East
                    watchers or not, but it was the sort of, “You've done the Arabs; you go do
                    them,” because we were getting a lot of inquiries. So suddenly I was doing
                    liaison with the Kuwaitis in exile, in particular. I remember one American
                    working for Kuwait Petroleum InternationaRalph Brown, a good friend, who called
                    up with the ever typical designed-to-endear- yourself-to-FSOs comment, “Well
                    we've got a problem because all of the Kuwaiti and Iraqi assets have been
                    frozen. We're actually selling jet fuel in Hong Kong. Here's who we are. Who's
                    this. I'm being forced to call you even though I know that U.S. Embassies are
                    totally ineffectual on this. No good will come of this.” “Thank you very much
                    for calling,” and I said I'll look into it. Basically we were all sort of
                    cutting and pasting; this was very ad hoc. And I basically said, “Okay, we'll
                    need copies of the transactions. The transactions can go forward. No money can
                    be transferred to Iraq or back to occupied Kuwait. Here's who you'll need to
                    contact at the Treasury.” You know it's like Casablanca; it was the beginning of
                    a great relationship. And fairly rapidly, I was getting a lot of calls because
                    you're seen as responsive.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>The Assets Control Office at Treasury was trying to do every five pound or
                    hundred franc transaction without additional staff and it rapidly became clear
                    that they were going to get overwhelmed. We're talking with the Bank of England
                    about the freeze and the Kuwaitis are beginning to stabilize because they've got
                    this huge operation overseas. They've got the Kuwait Investment Office in
                    London; they've got a major oil company in Europe with refineries in downstream
                    assets, and a whole bunch of other things. So I just start dealing with them. Of
                    course there are many sources of information. People calling up, “Well, what is
                    the state of their industry? What did they have in the country?” What does that
                    mean if the Iraqis take the additives the Kuwaitis had and use it for military
                    fuel, and so on and so forth. So there was a wide series of reporting
                    requirements, or things that you could get into, that were of interest to many
                    people. I just felt as though I was feeding this maw; that it all went in and
                    very little came out.</p>
                <p>They started getting people out and we started giving block grants of their own
                    money to Kuwaiti Embassies to handle their people in exile. We always retained
                    the right to go in and look at it, but I don't think we ever did. They really
                    started getting Kuwait, Incorporated in exile up and running again, and I was
                    very, very involved in this. In October two Kuwaitis from the oil company came
                    in who needed visas. They were going off to hire Red Adair, Boots and Coots, and
                    other firefighters. Texana Stubbin Papworth, my secretary - God love her, just
                    did absolutely Herculean efforts. She had stacks of these applications and just
                    knew the Kuwaitis, dealt with them, was always very civil to them at a time when
                    they'd lost their country, and they're feeling shattered and oppressed. She was
                    really just a sweetheart in dealing with them.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>What also happened is various committees started evolving to publicize the
                    Kuwaiti cause because we lived in an Arab neighborhood and in the first week
                    there was a pro-Iraqi demonstration on one side of Edgware Road and a
                    pro-Kuwaiti on the other, with the Bobbies in between. So this was getting
                    interesting. The Palestinians were getting involved. But I started working this,
                    and one day I was over at Kuwait Petroleum International and they'd gotten a
                    batch of “Long live free Kuwait” t-shirts in. They said, “Do you want some?” and
                    I said, “Oh sure,” so they handed me some and I said, “Actually can I have, oh,
                    about twenty?” They said, “Fine,” so I took them back to the embassy, walked in,
                    dropped them off at the Front Office, had them in my office, and it rapidly
                    became, “Where did you get those?” “I got it from Kuwait Petroleum.” “Can you
                    get more?” So I called them up and said, “I think you've got a winner here,
                    guys,” and what started to happen was a Mercedes would pull up behind the
                    American Embassy in London and 1000 t-shirts in boxes would come out. I would be
                    there with my little loading cart, our people would x-ray it and scan it, and
                    I'd bring the t-shirts in. It was all free; the Kuwaitis were donating it. One
                    of the most astute things they ever did. And I just had a sign up saying, “Send
                    it to whoever you want, but please, whoever gets it, send a thank-you note to
                    the Kuwait Investment Authority in Kuwait Petroleum International, 80 New Bond
                    Street in London.” This is becoming like this perpetual motion machine. The
                    Kuwaitis are thrilled that it's going to Pocatello, Idaho and the middle of
                    Kansas, so whenever I want t-shirts I can have them. And they started branching
                    out to baseball caps, umbrellas, sweatshirts. We gave Marilyn Quayle a “Free
                    Kuwait” sweatshirt and umbrella.</p>
                <p>The baseball hats were particularly popular and at this point I had friends in
                    the Gulf in Riyadh, and elsewhere, and I just took a box of the baseball hats
                    and sent it out in the APO (Army Post Office), and apparently Schwarzkopf was
                    walking through the embassy in Riyadh one day and saw one and said, “I want one,
                    where did this come from?” So I came back and had four yellow slips on my desk,
                    “Call the following military people,” and it was basically, “Norm wants.” So I
                    called the Kuwaitis and got about 100 hats and handed them to the Air Force and
                    they were packed off to Riyadh. I think when it was all said and done, we went
                    through 8000 t-shirts.</p>

                <p>TYSON: For you who have been in the Middle East, that was a very interesting one.
                    Of course I understand exactly what you're saying, and yet, from his cultural
                    context he is trying to show that he is protective of children and cares for
                    them and would not do harm them, while the rest of the western world looks at it
                    and sees it almost as a sexual assault or something like that. And, no, that had
                    a lot of impact there and getting the hostages out and then the build-up and
                    everything else.</p>

                        problems there might be, there was a drawing together of the Americans and

                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Oh my God. Problems - hardly. “Excuse me, let me bring my bag of state
                    secrets over to you and you can hand me your bag of state secrets.” The
                    cooperation with the Uthe Bank of England, the Treasury, FCO, and State - was
                    just phenomenal, this was really the special relationship in war. I remember
                    being the duty officer and having to go over to FCO one Saturday morning?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: FCO would be?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Foreign Commonwealth Office. ?to see the duty officers there and I'm sort
                    of American weekend casual; boat shoes, blue jeans, work shirt, baseball hat.
                    They're in sort of tattered corduroys and a jumper and stuff like that. It's
                    these cultural moments. I mean, literally, it was hauling out some of our
                    classified stuff and then reading theirs, taking notes, taking our stuff back,
                    “Thank you very much.” It was actually an interesting incident because they
                    looked at me, the two duty officers, and said, “What are you doing about Jews in
                    your forces?” and I said, “We're sending them and the women, too.” “Oh, are you
                    sure about that?” and I looked at them and said, “I was one of the tokens who
                    has already done Saudi Arabia. We're sure about it and this is what we're
                    doing.” I think that had some influence on some of their decisions, too.</p>
                <p>The cooperation with the British was just phenomenal on the freeze. Indeed,
                    later, after Kuwait was liberated and the freeze was lifted, Kuwait Investment
                    Office hosted a dinner for a number of the people who had worked with them in
                    London. I mean, it's extraordinary that you're thanking the two countries that
                    have basically slammed a hold on a hundred billion of your assets. A hundred
                    billion. Just a huge amount of money.</p>
                <p>I think it was handled in a very civilized and a remarkably sensitive and
                    respectful basis. And that's paid out down the line.</p>
                <p>

                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>TYSON: Right, it's the oil spills in the Gulf just before Desert Storm went in
                    and liberated Kuwait. The Iraqis were pumping millions of barrels of oil out
                    into the Gulf from their facilities in Al Ahmadi in Kuwait and this was
                    obviously becoming something of a problem and one of the things that I diwas
                    asked to dwas I went to Kuwait Petroleum in London; walked over there one day
                    through the square, down the streets and all, met with them, and they pulled out
                    a facilities map, schematic and marked, and basically said, “Bomb here, and bomb
                    here.” I put it in my briefcase, walked it back to the embassy, handed it to the
                    Air Force. And a few days later the bombing did occur. Later on when I was in
                    Kuwait I talked to some of the people, the Kuwaitis who were involved in the
                    resistance there, about their side of that, but we can get into that later.</p>
                <p>I ended up doing an awful lot after the liberation. For some reason or another,
                    my phone and my fax, or the fax in the econ section, became the contact point
                    and we were dealing with what we called the “purple death ray people,” and that
                    would be, you know, someone calls up and says, “I have a purple death ray that
                    can solve the fire fighting. If you give me a million dollars (or whatever),
                    this will go on.” We toasted about four fax machines just overloaded with stuff
                    coming in; engineering drawings and everything else. But it was an interesting
                    process, once again involving Bechtel and Kuwait Petroleum. It was the type of
                    thing that everybody was rushing to get into Kuwait and there was no particular
                    reason for me to go there. There were problems getting equipment in and at one
                    point Kuwait Petroleum came and basically asked to charter a C-5A in order to
                    bring in a whole work over rig from Houston, which I helped arrange. It was one
                    of the more bizarre moments of go and rent an Air Force plane.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The C-5 is the biggest plane in our inventory.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Right. It's a huge cargo plane.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was making the decisions of who knows what they're
                        talking about and who doesn't, on this fire-fighting thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>TYSON: There really weren't all that many decisions. First of all, a lot of it
                    was experience. On the fire-fighting in the past, what had happened is that
                    basically it came down to the difference between a one-off construction or
                    making a custom-made suit versus an assembly line. This was one of the few
                    situations in the world. There was something in, I think '47, in Borneo or
                    whatever, where there was a field on fire, but most of the time fire-fighting
                    involved one, perhaps two, wells going out. Red Adair or Boots and Coots or one
                    of the well-known people comes out, handles it, and it's very specific to that.
                    In Kuwait you had close to 500 wells on fire and a number of them gushing oil,
                    but not on fire. There were different problems. There were the ones gushing, but
                    not on fire, the ones on fire, and then a subset of that - about 60 of them were
                    extremely high pressure with hydrogen sulfide, and extremely dangerous. So there
                    was a basic effort to first get water pumped in, and then gradually an assembly
                    line sort of development to handle the well-killing and the fire-fighting. And
                    it went along surprisingly fast. There had been predictions that it might take
                    as long as five years and ultimately is was done in somewhere between nine and
                    ten months. As it went on, there were a whole lot of different groups wanting to
                    get involved in ithe Hungarians and others, and some of them were very good at
                    it.</p>
                <p>The Kuwaitis had a lot of their own indigenous engineers involved in this,
                    including one woman. So with the support of Bechtel and a number of other
                    things, Red Adair, Boots and Coots, and the fire fighters - I think there were
                    four groups, the fire fighters specifically, it went remarkably well. A lot of
                    it was cutting red tape; getting stuff to move and doing things like that. I
                    don't think there was any one real set decision making process; there was an
                    awful lot of autonomy and by working and coordinating with the Kuwaitis we just
                    got a lot of stuff done, and frankly didn't ask Washington in many
                    instances.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just for the record, these fires were started by the
                        Iraqis to be beastly, was that it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Pretty much. They wired the well heads and exploded them on the way out.
                    It was truly one of the great crimes, and ecological crimes, of all time. I
                    guess eventually the Kuwaitis will have an estimate on how much oil they lost,
                    but at the initial stages I seem to recall that six million barrels a day was
                    either going up in flames or just flowing out onto the desert. So it was a huge
                    loss.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, this would be wha'81?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: It would be '91. Kuwait would've been liberated by about May, so it would
                    basically be the end of '91, early '92.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then where did you go?</hi>

                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>TYSON: I stayed on in London and I actually got paneled very early on to become
                    economic counselor in Kuwait. So my tour ended in July of '93. We came back home
                    and did home leave and consultations and we flew into Kuwait City on September
                    1st of 1993.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were there until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: I was there until June of 1996, so it was a three year tour.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Kuwait when you got there in
                        '93?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: The situation in Kuwait was surprisingly good in many ways. Of course
                    there was the invasion/occupation damage, but there had been very little
                    fighting in the city itself; a lot of the major infrastructure had been brought
                    back up so you had electricity, water, air conditioning. The shops were
                    operating. There was a lot of wreckage on the “highway of death” towards Basra,
                    and out in the desert. There was some damage in the city, but you sort of had to
                    look for it. In many ways, the damage to buildings and stuff, including hotels,
                    was somewhat cosmetic; they'd need to redo the exterior and interior walls, but
                    it's not as though they took the structural steel down. So in many ways it was a
                    return to more normalcy.</p>
                <p>It was also a big transition for the embassy because there had been the group
                    that had come in right at liberation, reopened the embassy under difficult and
                    adverse circumstances, and now they were being transferred out. It was more of a
                    return to a normal Foreign Service type of post. Ambassador Edward “Skip” Gnehm
                    was there; he had been there since liberation and he stayed until 1994. So I was
                    there for the last year of his term of office out there. He was much admired;
                    very, very active in Kuwait and quite the personality. Very much the right man,
                    at the right place, at the right time. Not everybody's cup of tea, but a hell of
                    an ambassador. Really knew a lot of people in the country and really pushed the
                    embassy to be out and active, and if anything, I think that the Kuwaitis or
                    certain elements of Kuwaiti society, said that the U.S. Embassy was too active,
                    but so be it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your view of the Kuwaiti government at that
                        time; were they like the Bourbonforgot nothing and learned nothing, or was
                        there a change from what you were able to gather?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>TYSON: I think it remains to be seen. There were certainly changes. The
                    parliament had been suspended and it was agreed that it would be restored. There
                    were elections to parliament that occurred shortly before I got there, so you
                    had a new fairly activist parliament. There was a perception that unlike
                    previously, the royal family could not capriciously just dismiss it. It had been
                    suspended for a long time; there had obviously been the invasion, the
                    liberation, and everything else, so there was a large process of the government
                    sorting itself out and a lot of internal political jockeying going on. Frankly
                    as to the long-term political acumen of the Al Sabah family, I think it still
                    remains to be seen. They've learned some things though perhaps not as much as
                    they should have.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a group of those that stayed behind, and were
                        active in the resistance, who had become a different breed of cat than those
                        who had been taking their vacation in London and just hadn't gone through
                        that? You know, because this often becomes a real divide.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: There were some very interesting splits, and in a sense I played an
                    interesting role in that. There were different groups. First of all, as is often
                    the case in that part of the world, you had a lot of the Kuwaitis out of the
                    country on vacation when it was invaded on August 2. So there were any number of
                    people who were not in Kuwait. So right at the beginning, August 2, you've got
                    those who are in, those who are out.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>Within the next few months you had a number who found that it not always easy,
                    but there were ways to get oueither over desert tracks, bribing the Iraqis, or
                    any number of other things. So you had a group who left at that point. Some who
                    just took a look and made the choice to do it. Certain specialists, I don't have
                    the whole storthere was no reason I needed it; were ordered out; some of the oil
                    company experts and others. Others stayed behind; others got family members out,
                    that type of thing. I think if there was any dissension between those who stayed
                    and those who left; it would be that group who left Kuwait after the Iraqi
                    occupation. You have that group. Then there's the subset of the actual
                    resistance, including those who were very active in the oil fields in Ahmadi.
                    The Kuwaiti group which was out of the country took a lot of flak; some of which
                    was deserved for the playboy warriors of the discos. Certainly there was a lot
                    of that, I think probably more on the European continent than in London itself.
                    There was a large Kuwaiti community in London. Kuwait had a lot of its assets
                    and financial operations there, including the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation,
                    Kuwait Petroleum International, their European subsidiary, and the Kuwait
                    Investment Office. My take on the Kuwaitis in London was that I've rarely seen a
                    harder-working bunch of people in my life. If I needed them anytime, seven days
                    a week, I'd call the office and someone was there. There were very, very
                    effective. In fact, some of the Kuwaitis used to joke about certain of their
                    own, that, “My God, we never knew he could work until he had to,” and a lot of
                    them were really throwing their backs into the effort. I found later on when I
                    was in Kuwait and when I would meet many of the people that I had dealt with in
                    London at some of the “diwanis” or the meeting places where the men would sit
                    and talk; I would make a point of saying that I had known them in London and I
                    had certainly appreciated the extraordinary amount of work that they had done
                    for their country and their people. Obviously this works out very well for other
                    reasons, but it was very easy to do because it was true. And with certain
                    families you could just basically say, “I worked with your brother, your cousin,
                    your nephew,” and I basically said, “I of course know what you went through in
                    terms of the excesses of the occupation, the brutality of the Iraqis, but I
                    gotta tell you, much like the Dutch resistance in exile,” or something like
                    this, “these people played a part in the ultimate liberation of your country.” A
                    few, maybe one or two of the minor Al Sabah who were seen in the discos, but I
                    think the more astute people recognized the publicity problems with that. But
                    from my perspective, the people that I was dealing with were working very, very
                    hard.</p>
                <p>Sheik Ali Jabar Al Sabah, who is an Al Sabah married to one of the emir's
                    daughters, came by for a little Christmas open house that we had; driving a
                    ten-year-old Mercedes, extremely understated - no flash or glitz, and some of
                    the other guests, actually some Iranians that I dealt with because of the oil
                    business, apparently looked at Anwar and said, “Well, how are you related to the
                    emir?” and she said, “He's my father.” But, I mean, there were some very, very
                    hard-working Kuwaitis.</p>
                <p>There's a whole other story going on with the Spanish investments, which went
                    south to the tune of about five to six billion dollars. But London, in many
                    ways, was really quite the nucleus of Kuwait in exile.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any handle on the Spanish connection?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: I knew it was going on, but our embassies around Europe were dealing with
                    different aspects of Kuwait. I realize that there was something involving the
                    Kuwait Investment Office, but that didn't particularly concern me. It would be
                    our embassy in Madrid or the Brits in Madrid. There was a certain
                    compartmentalization. Of course the corporate structures, the expensive lawyers
                    that the Kuwaitis had hired to set up all of this was Grupo Torras in Spain. It
                    was a very different thing. I later got involved with aspects of it in Kuwait
                    when I was there, but there was no particular reason for me to get involved in
                    it in London.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your take on the effect of the expulsion of the
                        Palestinians, and was it a real expulsion of the Palestinians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: It was. First of all, it was rather interesting. I ended up butting heads
                    about this with Ambassador Gnehm. I was working with the Kuwaitis on the return;
                    the fire-fighting, the reconstruction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is when you're in London?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: In London. So, you start with, “Well, what happens?” I mean, it's sort of
                    like a Berlin airlift type of thing. How do you supply a city or a country with
                    “x” million people, and the number was approximately 2.2 million previously. It
                    became rapidly clear that the math of most of the Kuwaitis was 2.2 minus 400,000
                    Palestinians equals 1.8. In some of the cable reporting that I was doing I was
                    mentioning that there were definite statements that there would be no role for
                    the Palestinians in a liberated Kuwait. Ambassador Gnehm came through, and of
                    course he had been named, and he was dealing with the government in Taif and he
                    sort of said to me, “Well you don't need to say that anymore,” and I said,
                    “Well, I continue to hear it.” “Well you don't need to say that anymore,” and I
                    finally said, “$20 says that a year after liberation there'll be less than
                    50,000 Palestinians in a liberated Kuwait,” and he didn't take the bet, but the
                    numbers were pretty accurate. There were 400,000 at the time of the Iraqi
                    occupation; by the time of Desert Storm, something like 200,000 either had been
                    forced out, had chosen to leave; any number of other things, and then I think in
                    fairly short order after that, many left. Now a few Palestinians who were
                    extremely well-connected managed to get back in or stay on, but it was generally
                    with the royal family acquiescence. And sometimes it was a shell game; they had
                    to get another passport, like a British passport or something, but those numbers
                    were very, very limited. There are also a number of instances of particularly
                    Palestinian women married to Kuwaitis who ended up staying on, too.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the effect of taking this entrepreneurial group
                        out of Kuwait when you were economic officer there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: It opened up opportunities for others. First of all, I think the next
                    generatiothe younger generation of Kuwaitisuddenly had to put their back into it
                    as opposed to basically throwing a bunch of papers at the Palestinian clerk.
                    Kuwaitis are also sophisticated consumers of labor; they got Filipinos in,
                    Indians, and others, to fill in on some of those jobs.</p>
                <p>The most striking change was probably in the neighborhood just over from us. We
                    lived in a district called Jabria. Hawali was one district over and the joke was
                    that it was the capital city of Palestine. I remember I used to get my
                    electronics and stuff repaired at Palestine T.V. in Hawali. And that had been
                    quite the neighborhood and obviously the population was much less, and other
                    groups and so forth had moved in. I think it was an absolutely wrenching blow to
                    the Palestinians and a lot of work that I did involved aid to the Palestiniannot
                    exactly the most popular thing with the Kuwaitis. I dealt with Palestinian
                    monies and reparations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what were you getting from accounts? I mean, after
                        sorting it through, how have essentially the Palestinian population behaved
                        when the Iraqis came in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Gnehm disagrees with it. It's oil. It's always been oil. There's a hundred
                    billion barrels worth of reserves in Kuwait; on field, Berghan has got about
                    fifty. Iraq, with Iraq and Kuwait, is still not Saudi Arabia, but it's a major
                    world power?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In this immediate post-war period, did we have any real
                        leverage as far as getting what we could out of our economic relationship
                        with the Kuwaitis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Oh, we got a huge amount out of it. The anecdotal statement was that we
                    made money on the war, given their transfer payments to us, which were huge. We
                    certainly got in there with huge amounts of weapon sales; U.S. contractors and
                    so forth had the ability, at least for a time, to come in without local
                    sponsors. No, I think there was certainly money to be made and the Kuwaitis
                    needed things and I think we provided them. We were certainly very, very
                    concerned about the commercial opportunities and the economic aspects. Of course
                    much of this was done at extremely high levels, but other countries were also
                    getting payments, too. The Russians got a billion dollar loan which I doubt that
                    the Kuwaitis ever collected on. Turkey had a commitment for a total of a billion
                    dollars over five years; 200 million a year. I think Syria, the Egyptians, any
                    number of others, got debt forgiveness, actual grants, low-concession loans. The
                    Kuwaitis were passing out the daj and it bought them support.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find when you went there that economic ministries,
                        with whom I imagine you dealt, were pretty much back and running?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: They were very much back and running, and in many cases like at the Kuwait
                    Investment Authority; it was people I had dealt with in London. The key
                    officials were people I had known in London. I think the economists who are
                    always more tuned in to a world economy, and the Kuwaitis are as sophisticated
                    as the day is long, were always easier to deal with. At the top level, they're
                    pros. You'd get visitors in from Washington and the Kuwaitis at the upper tier
                    are extremely impressive. So in terms of that, professionally it was a great
                    deal of fun.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any Iranian factor while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: There certainly is. The Shia population in Kuwait tends to be of Iranian
                    origin. There have always been ties to Iran. I just think that there was always
                    an undercurrent of potential unrest or hostility, but people other than myself
                    are probably better qualified to comment on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Saudi Arabia; how were ties there? Have they
                        improved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: The Kuwaitis understood the importance of Saudi Arabia, and of course the
                    Saudi viewpoint is important. But they're very different societies in some ways.
                    It's sort of like Mississippi attempting to dictate to New York state, or
                    California. The Kuwaitis were not always in tune with the more conservative
                    aspects of Saudi society. There's always been a certain amount of backbiting and
                    rivalry there, which I think continued at lower levels or sotto voice. Clearly
                    the Kuwaitis understood that the support of their GCC [Cooperation Council for
                    the Arab States of the Gulf] neighbors was very important, so they were going to
                    have to work at it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Prior to the Gulf War the Kuwaitis had kept most of their
                        Arab neighbors at arm's length, saying, “We know how to handle this,” and
                        “We can take care of it,” and “Don't bother us.” The Kuwaitis, let's say,
                        were not beloved by its Arab people including Egypt and Saudi Arabia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Oh I think that was true then, and to some degree it probably continues to
                    this day. They were seen as difficult, distant, arrogant, and any number of
                    other things. I think there was a sentiment that, well it was a pity that it had
                    to happen, in terms of the Iraqi invasion, but if it had to happen to someone,
                    it was just as well that it happened to the Kuwaitis.</p>
                <p>Talking with Kuwaitis, both then and later, you get another Arab saying something
                    pretty hateful and the Kuwaitis would be shocked, and I think you get a bunch of
                    ex-pats there, including the Brits or the Americans, who would say, “Haven't you
                    heard that before? We certainly have.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Well, he basically said that the reasons we did it was the defense of
                    liberty and the repelling regression, and any number of other things, which were
                    all, I think, fairly true in some ways, but there are other wags who've pointed
                    out that we would not exactly have done it in the same situation if it were,
                    say, Mauritania. This was striking much closer at U.S. vital interests, and
                    certainly the oil focused everybody's attention.</p>

                        talking about Kuwaiti oil, but really the eastern province, and to having
                        probably as nasty a dictator as has come down the pike sitting on?</hi>

                </p>
                <p>TYSON: I think that was basically true and I honestly think that in the period
                    from about August 2 to August 11, if Saddam had rolled further down, he probably
                    could've gotten to the causeway to Bahrain without undue problems. His supply
                    lines and stuff would've been stretched, but he probably could've gotten further
                    into the eastern province.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've talked to people who've dealt with the Iraqis, and
                        who were in Baghdad, and said the Iraqis had terrible supply problems. This
                        is during the Iran-Iraq War; they just couldn't deliver. They'd get
                        something going and they just couldn't support it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: There were stories, in the later stages of the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait,
                    of Iraqi soldiers begging food from the Kuwaitis because they weren't being
                    supplied. Now obviously, this had its advantages in that, if you've got a
                    soldier there who needs food, he's quite susceptible to bribery on any number of
                    levels - and I think a great deal of that did occur. There were clearly supply
                    problems.</p>
                <p>I think in that first week afterwards there was little standing in their way in
                    the eastern province.</p>

                        hands working at our embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Not really. It was pretty much Skip Gnehm with very much of a hand-picked
                    team.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the DCM?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: When I got there Mary Jeanne Kennedy had just left and Georgia DeBell came
                    in, so she was the DCM, and actually she was the DCM my entire time there.
                    Political counselor my first year was Matt Tueller, a reasonably junior officer
                    that Skip had picked up and really elevated to quite a senior level. My
                    predecessor was Paul Daly, and Tueller was eventually replaced by Margaret
                    Scobey. So I mean Skip had gone through, and where I give him credit, he is less
                    concerned about rank and protocol, and more about particular talents of an
                    officer; and he's willing to give you a lot of leeway until you prove
                    otherwise.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of tasks were you getting assigned from
                        Washington, on the economic thing particularly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: I think Washington was terribly interested in the Kuwait economics and
                    some of their foreign investments; the whole structure of the oil industry and
                    the refurbishment of it. The returning of Kuwait to being a player in the world
                    oil market and in OPEC. Some major investment projects like petrochemical plants
                    and a number of other things. Pretty much a wide range of economic and
                    commercial things, worked with my commercial counterpart. It would depend. We
                    were starting to get a lot more on copyright infringements, bootlegs, tapes and
                    software, IPR [Intellectual Property Rights], and trademark stuff.</p>
                <p>

                <p>TYSON: Well it was, or it was coming out of places like Indonesia or Jebel Ali
                    down in the UAE [United Arab Emirates], and anybody with a tape duplicator can
                    buy masters in Amsterdam and run twenty copies. The cassette shops were all over
                    the place. People were doing bootleg software. For a wealthy country, the
                    Kuwaitis can be cheap about things. So there's an interesting market; you get
                    really high-end designer goods, and absolute crap out of the factories of China.
                    For many people the difference between buying the trademark stuff versus a good
                    bootleg that you got from your cousin more than outweighed the ability to have
                    servicing. It's a tough issue, and in that sense Kuwait was a Third World
                    country.</p>
                <p>What's interesting though is they were a member of GATT [General Agreement on
                    Tariffs and Trade]; it was sort of like Grandpa had bought them a membership to
                    the country club that they'd sort of forgotten about. So they don't face the
                    issues that Saudi Arabia and others do now. They don't have to join; they're
                    already members.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would imagine, speaking of Kuwait with these tremendous
                        sums of money, that there was a whole area way above your pay grade that was
                        taking place between say in London or Washington Treasury and all that or
                        not. Reinvestments and things like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: The investments were being pretty much done on a commercial basis. There
                    was some government to government stuff. The things that came up more than
                    anything else, the bane of my existence, was foreign military sales payments -
                    because the Kuwaitis were purchasing a lot and it's sort of like a revolving
                    charge card; the more you buy, the larger your quarterly payments get. More
                    often than not, it was just a question of getting the paperwork through the
                    Kuwaiti bureaucracy. The money would be there, but I'd be working a program and
                    then the head of the Office of Military Cooperation, a U.S. general, would run
                    into problems. And he generally had an officer on his staff doing FMS (Foreign
                    Military Sales) payments. Such officers varied in quality. The last one there
                    who's a friend of mine, Jim Dursow, was much more thorough and systematic, and
                    easier to work with. But a lot of our military guys were in and out of the
                    country and something would happen; the payment would be due, it wouldn't be
                    made, the finance center back in the States would go ballistic, the officer who
                    was supposed to do it wasn't around, so the general goes to the ambassador and
                    suddenly the vital project that I'm working on is not so vital, and I get to
                    pursue money through the Kuwaiti bureaucracy. I literally had a card in my
                    file-o-fax of the five numbers to call asking, “Okay, where's the money?”
                    because once it moved from the Ministry of Defense, it would take anywhere from
                    three to seven days to get the requisite approvals. And it's almost like
                    tracking a satellite; it's at the Finance Ministry, it's about to go to the
                    central bank, the wire transfer will be done. That was typical inter-agency
                    stuff at an embassy. You know, let me drop everything to do your work for you.
                    More often than not, when we actually had a U.S. officer there prompting the
                    Kuwaitis, “Hey, it's coming up in fifteen days. What have you guys done about
                    it?” it was done on a somewhat more timely basis. It was more just bureaucratic
                    ineptitude as opposed to lack of money.</p>

                        the impression that here's a very small country with a bunch of people who
                        really don't want not military type people - and you can get all the
                        equipment you want. You know, upper-end stuff, but who's going to fly it, or
                        drive it, or shoot it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: What an interesting question, and I think many are still asking it.
                    Interestingly enough, fighter pilots were less of a problem. Where we had
                    problems was with the backbone of the army; you know, your NCO (Non-Commissioned
                    Officer) level: your technicians. For example with the Abrams tank, trying to
                    train tank crews up to operate this incredibly sophisticated piece of equipment
                    was a real challenge. I don't know whether anything more has been done on it; I
                    know the training aspect of it and building the personnel side of a modern
                    military force has been one of the most challenging things our advisers have
                    faced.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get the usual push and pull; our military says,
                        “Oh hell, let's sell them this,” because then you begin to make in savings
                        and having large orders and all of that, and then we have to worry about
                        this from sort of a diplomatic side of who's going to use it and all of
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: I think there was less of a concern about that. A lot of the big arms
                    deals had been pretty much consummated, if not delivered, by the time I got
                    there. Stuff would come up for other bits of equipment: helicopters, or
                    howitzers, or artillery, or stuff like that. The big deals, in a sense, had been
                    done.</p>
                <p>One of the problem areas in terms of sales, and you asked about it, was more
                    commercial aircraft. Boeing, in particular, I think felt that while they didn't
                    have a written commitment, there was a moral obligation to buy, and I think the
                    Kuwaitis felt that they are buying U.S. tanks so a lot of the commercial
                    aircraft actually went to Airbus, and of course the Europeans. So that wasn't
                    particularly popular.</p>
                <p>The whole question of what you're selling, and their ability to field it, and
                    absorb it, and maintain it, I think, is a valid one. I can't say that I have any
                    definitive answers to that; I defer to my military colleagues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How open did you find, socially which spills into
                        professional, Kuwaiti society? You know - entertaining, getting out, meeting
                        the folks, and all of that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>TYSON: It is very interesting; my wife basically says that in a sense we have
                    closer Saudi friends than we do Kuwaitis, and I think in a sense that's true.
                    There's a bit of standoffishness about aspects of Kuwaiti society, although we
                    did come to know a number of them. There was an active expat community there; we
                    had some British friends and other friends. One did not want for company. There
                    were a lot of receptions done for business reasons; someone's coming in. I
                    remember meeting now Vice President Cheney at a reception because I knew the
                    local agent for Halliburton. You know, so you'll show up, it'll be a nice hotel,
                    there'll be decent food, the usual assortment of soft drinks or fruit juices,
                    and it's a small town so you meet the usual suspects. One had access, could meet
                    people, do things.</p>
                <p>There are a number of Kuwaiti families, actually, who did some very nice things
                    about hosting the troops who were being rotated through Camp Doha; on
                    Thanksgiving and Christmas, and some of the other holidays, which was very, very
                    nice. I've always sort of said that it's interesting that in the United States
                    the Kuwaitis among the Arabs are like Bostonians, and I think there's a certain
                    affinity, in terms of the styles of people, in that there's perhaps a bit more
                    of a distance and a reserve. I came out of the country with friends, but there
                    have been countries that have been friendlier. But from my standpoint, no
                    complaints.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TYSON: I came back and I went over to the Pentagon on the State-DOD (Department
                    of Defense) exchange, and I went to the Office of Foreign Military Rights
                    Affairs to basically work as a lawyer doing Status of Forces Agreements. I had
                    responsibility for the CENTCOM (Central Command) area, the Middle East, all of
                    Africa - which CENTCOM has got part of East Africa - and all of Central and
                    South America. I also worked on the Foreign Student Program at the Service
                    Academies in which we recruit and get foreign students to go to the three
                    Service academies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find working on the Status of Forces
                        Agreements? I've talked to people that have been involved from the State
                        Department and embassies on negotiating these agreements and they say that,
                        almost to a person, that the problem is not coming up with a good agreement
                        with a country, it's coming up with an agreement that you can get past the
                        Pentagon lawyers.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>TYSON: This office was headed by Phil Berringer who was in his 80s when I was
                    working for him. He was the grand old man of Status of Forces Agreements and
                    base negotiations. His deputy was Frank Stone who is a retired JAG [Judge
                    Advocate General] lawyer. It's not only the lawyers, it's these high
                    priests.</p>
                <p>Now certain things that happened after the Berlin Wall fell are also important to
                    consider; I mean, I think base negotiations for many countries had basically
                    been an excuse to shake the U.S. piggy bank and see what came out, for years.
                    And after the fall of the Berlin Wall there was more and more of a focus on
                    burden sharing. And much more of the, “No, we're doing this because it benefits
                    both of us; now your side of the cost equation is the following?” And I think a
                    lot of countries just figured, you know, the gringos are going to come in and
                    we're going to do this and that, and were very, very wrong. There's also more of
                    a move away from the, “We need the base with the American flag on it.” We were
                    much more concerned about access to adequate facilities, whoever owned them,
                    when we needed them. So I think a lot of our leverage on the other side had
                    changed.</p>
                <p>There also was the fact that some State Department people lacked an understanding
                    of what Status of Forces Agreements could do, or how you could do it. During one
                    of my recent inspections in South America this came up. Part of it was knowing
                    how to use a lawyer rather than just deferring to the military. “We wish to
                    accomplish the following.” For example, you want your troops to have their
                    weapons. Fine. You can have a statement saying they can carry all unit equipment
                    including weapons, in an exchange of notes. Some countries don't like that
                    explicit, so it's “all unit and ancillary equipment,” nod, nod, wink, wink; we
                    know it means guns, but we won't say it means guns. Or “any material required
                    for the performance of the mission.” You know, there's that sort of agreement
                    that if you had to stand up in parliament you could say, “Oh well, we didn't
                    authorize guns.” There were others ways around sticky problems.</p>
                <p>There was the option of an exchange of note, what we call Administrative and
                    Technical Status Agreements. Sort of standard language with different options
                    that one could opt for. And a lot of it was just also educating an embassbecause
                    you know we were fairly amenable, too. You get an embassy that would come back
                    with one or two comments as to why or why not this was the way to do it. You
                    could often manage to make it work.</p>

                        Latin America. By this time we must have been very aware of the problem of
                        getting students, particularly Latin American students, who weren't going to
                        go back and beat up on their people.</hi>

                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>TYSON: That was more School of the Americas and IMET [International Military
                    Education and Training] issues. At the Service Academies, actually the issue was
                    that each academy could have up to forty foreign students; that's one percent of
                    the student body. The issue became who paid for this and this was on different
                    income levels. When I came in, the vast, vast majority of students were getting
                    a full ride courtesy of the U.S. government. There were high income countries
                    that were going to pay full freight, a sort of middle that would pay part of it,
                    and then many who were going to get the scholarships. Representative BuyeI guess
                    he's from Indiana or something like thareally wanted to clamp down on and reduce
                    the number of full rides. Basically this was going to mean that a lot of
                    otherwise qualified students weren't going to come because their governments
                    couldn't afford it.</p>
                <p>You also have situations like the Brits, the Japanese, and others have their own
                    service academies; they don't send their people to ours. We were picking up a
                    huge number of very qualified Eastern Europeans - Croatians and others, that I
                    think in the long term were going to make a huge difference. We were getting
                    involved in Hill legislation among other things, and I rapidly found that about
                    half of each day, every day, was occupied by this. While it's a worthy and noble
                    cause, you don't need an FSO-1, full colonel equivalent, doing this. And indeed,
                    when I left I said, “Noble cause, but, one, it probably shouldn't be in this
                    office; two, it should be handled by a lower ranking FSO.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you were there until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: '98.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Went to the National War College at Fort McNair from '98 to '99.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the War College?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: I found the War College quite interesting; it's the fast-track of the best
                    and brightest. I'm an army brat and had served in a number of posts overseas
                    such as Germany and Kuwait and Saudi with strong military presences, so it
                    wasn't a total shock to me.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>What was most striking about this particular year and this particular time were
                    two things: one, continuing my perfect record, we weren't in the beautiful
                    building on Fort McNair; that was being renovated. So we were on the fourth
                    floor of the Coast Guard Headquarters building; so you walked through the back
                    gate and up into this temporary facility. The second thing was this was during
                    the impeachment of President Clinton and we're studying American policy. It was
                    absolutely fascinating because there's a large range of people from the military
                    in the War College of varying political views. I think it's no surprise that the
                    military tends to be somewhat more conservative, although not exclusively. It
                    was fascinating because it was the civilians, particularly the Foreign Service
                    Officers, who called the result. They basically said, “Beyond the merits, beyond
                    the girl, beyond this and that, he's going to walk because they don't have the
                    votes.” It was one of these very, very interesting things; it was an aspect of
                    American society.</p>
                <p>Of course I was also struck by the fact that you're put into sort of committees
                    and your committee leader is designated. You know, let's see, “We're here to
                    learn about democracy and you've just appointed the leader. What is wrong with
                    this picture?” But it's a great program. I have absolutely recommended the War
                    College or war colleges to people I know who are a few years behind me in the
                    career or who have worked for me. I think it's a big plus in that the State
                    Department can learn about the capabilities of the military, and the military in
                    many ways can learn about the capabilities of the State Department. It's, I
                    think, one of the strongest programs that we have, I particularly liked the fact
                    it was “national” so no one's service or no one group of civilians dominated;
                    all must play well with others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things that struck me is that sort of the new
                        Foreign Service is coming along and people of my generation - I'm 73 now,
                        almost always were male and we'd served; I had my four years as an enlisted
                        man in the military, but I've always known the military, so it's no great
                        shock to me. But you've got kids coming right out of college who have no
                        conception of the military, and tend to look down on it, which is a great
                        disservice to their own professional ability.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: Well that's true, but, you know, the other side of it is you're getting
                    some very fast track women in the military; women who have gone to West Point or
                    the Air Force Academy who are definitely on the “general” track. So I think it's
                    a little bit more mixed up; it's just society has changed. I think one of the
                    most disturbing things, and particularly in some of the army units and the
                    marine units, was the sociology of the junior officers in the past tended to
                    follow the tradition of apolitical involvement in the military. There was much
                    more of a explicit pro-Republican, anti-Democrat attitude and also a much more
                    fundamentalist Christian type of bias among some, which is somewhat disturbing
                    to us who aren't Christian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well even for those of us who come from the Christian
                        tradition it tends to be rather there are solid straight answers and all;
                        you know there isn't much deviation and this is scary. Particularly in a
                        military man. I mean you want some flexibility.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>TYSON: It was interesting because there was one army guy. At the end, you were
                    put into different groups, so there was an attempt to mix everybody up, which
                    was fine. And at the end of it they'd have what they call the sort of “hot wash”
                    evaluation, so your instructor or your committee would sort of pick someone from
                    the group to go and do that and twelve people from the different groups would do
                    it. At one evaluation, it just turned out that five of the twelve people were
                    Foreign Service Officers and I was one of them. And this one army guy basically
                    said, “Well the Foreign Service is here; now we'll hear from the left,” and a
                    number of us really looked and said, “Look, hot shot, we have worked and served
                    both Democratic and Republican administrationas a matter of fact, the bulk of my
                    career has been Republican administrationwe're here to serve the country. What
                    you said is very inappropriate.” I had just had it with him and I basically
                    said, “I guess you've never really seen a Foreign Service Officer wreck a
                    Service career, have you?” and he looked a little stunned and in front of my
                    colleagues I said, “You know the guys with four starthe commanding generals?
                    Sometimes comes to receptions, you're near the ambassador and the general says
                    to you, 'Well, how is Colonel so-and-so doing?' and you just basically remark
                    upon how much better it will be for him to get to the troops, to the real army,
                    and serve where things are much more direct and his sort of take charge bullish
                    style will probably be more appreciated, i.e., 'Don't ever put this guy in the
                    Pentagon. Don't let him play with others.'" And I think it stunned him that
                    someone outside the military could have that impact on it, and yet it was the
                    type of thing that military leaders overseas would occasionally ask - quietly,
                    privatelclearly they're going to make the decisions, but sometimes only after
                    getting input from an FSO on what we thought some of their subordinates or what
                    would we recommend.</p>
                <p>I remember a group of majors in Kuwait and looking at a few of them and saying,
                    “You know, these are really command and general staff track. They have real
                    futures in front of them.” And I think if you're remarking that to a commanding
                    officer who says, “Well someone else has noticed this,” it's a very positive
                    thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then in '99 you're out of the war college.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: I'm out of the war college and I come to work for the Inspector General's
                    Office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were there until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TYSON: I'm still there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You'd been in the Service for a long time; you'd been
                        inspected. What's your impression of how the inspection core works
                        today?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>TYSON: Right. Today it's in a particular state of flux. Frankly, before joining
                    the inspectors, I thought about it because I had been through one or two
                    inspections that I frankly thought were blow-offs and did very little. In other
                    situations it seemed as though the inspectors had gotten a few things right and
                    some changes came about. So on reflection, I decided, well, take the risk; let's
                    go ahead and see where we're going on all this.</p>
                <p>At the time I came in, the then-inspector general was really looking to change
                    and revise both how inspections were done, the products that we did, and any
                    number of other things. I'm not talking out of turn when I say there's been a
                    certain amount of turmoil in the OIG (Office of the Inspector General) in the
                    last two years. A new inspector is in and it looks as though there is going to
                    be much more of a return to traditional State Department inspections, and
                    attempt to do them on at least every five year basis because some posts are way,
                    way overdue. More of an attempt to do that. There may be some cross-cutting
                    studies, but I think basically the intent is to return to the core values or
                    your classic post inspection. The truth is, that in some ways a lot of how an
                    inspection goes depends in great part on the team leader, who often is a current
                    or a retired ambassador, and how aggressively they choose to pursue a number of
                    issues. I mean, clear malfeasance or something like that, theft or whatever,
                    that's fine. It's more judgment calls, and I think increasingly, too, it's much
                    more the broad systemic issues of personnel problems, shortages, any number of
                    other things that are not just one post or specific to one post, that need to be
                    addressed. I mean, there becomes the shrug and it's ever thus. There are times
                    when, as an inspector, you can make a difference. On my last inspection I
                    suggested someone for a Service-wide award and he won it. So that can be
                    positive.</p>
                <p>It's interesting how much you can learn about a post by doing interviews here and
                    going through the surveys. It's amazing what people will talk about and what you
                    find out about, and I think in a sense inspections are a very useful reality
                    check for Front Office, and much of the emphasis is on Front Office coordination
                    and leadership. I think a good ambassador or DCM will use an inspection as a
                    vehicle to solve a lot of things. Quite frankly, in many ways, you either want
                    the inspection to occur just as your arriving because whatever is found is not
                    your fault and someone is giving you a roadmap of, “This is wrong; you need to
                    fix this. Go here. Do this.” Fine. Either that, or you want to have just
                    departed when the inspectors come in because I think that one of the real
                    weaknesses is that they go into a situation, someone was there for three years,
                    bollixed it up, but they're gone. And it's only those who remain at post who
                    sort of get caught in the crosshairs, which in a sense is unfair, but that's
                    part of the way that it's been done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are you seeing a new beginning? Because there was a very
                        difficult time in the '90s of being starved for money which really had
                        effects up and down the line, didn't it? Have you been able to observe any
                        hope that things are beginning to come back again?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>TYSON: Some things are beginning to come back. I think you've got a number of
                    things; on the personnel side, we're going to be paying bills of the '90s for
                    years to come. I, of course, would not describe it as the Tony Quainton-Dick
                    Moose legacy, but others might. Those years of not recruiting, those years of
                    deficit, will skew the Foreign Service career path for the next fifteen years.
                    It's just inevitable. They're taking in larger classes now, which in a sense
                    solve one body problem, but then the competition within those grades will be
                    much tougher and you're not entirely going to get a smooth pyramid or
                    flow-through. It's something that's going to have to be digested and worked
                    through.</p>
                <p>Clearly the personnel issues are huge. Africa and the Africa Bureau is probably
                    ground zero on terms of just recruiting qualified staff and bringing people up.
                    There are huge shortages. Part of the problem is at the top with some of our old
                    line ambassadors sitting there figuring, “Well, let the supplicants come forward
                    and I will anoint one of them,” and you're in the position of saying, “If you've
                    got a body, take a body.” Because the system is pulling out stuff that just flat
                    out won't be filled, and posts are going to have to make do with it. It's a lot
                    of stretching; stuff gets done in a slap-dash fashion. I've got a lot of
                    admiration for people working under adverse circumstances overseas, but there's
                    a time that it's just broke and someone needs to fix it. Once more into the
                    breech, boys, just doesn't cut it. You're burning people out. And I think about
                    the problem with Africa which has extremely difficult circumstances where you
                    stretched first or second tour officers too thin. Each individual decision makes
                    sense. You look at a place collectively and it's the kindergarten running the
                    school. With all due respect to some extremely qualified people there, the only
                    experienced folks you've got will be perhaps the ambassador and the DCand that's
                    just not enough. Not in those difficult type of environments. And then what
                    happenand this comes out in the candid, private meetingthe one lesson that these
                    people will learn is that they will never, ever, under any circumstances
                    including Cape Town or Jo'burg (Johannesburg), do sub-Saharan Africa; full stop.
                    That is no way to build a cadre of Africa experts.</p>
