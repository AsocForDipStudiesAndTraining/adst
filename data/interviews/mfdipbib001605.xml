                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: February 16, 2005</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is February 16, 2005. This is an interview with
                        Alfred H. Moses. What does the H stand for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Henry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Henry. This is being done on behalf of the Association for
                        Diplomatic Studies and Training, and I am Charles Stuart Kennedy. I notice
                        by listening to conversations you have had that you have been able to hang
                        on to the name Alfred. With people this must have been a battle in early
                        years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Well it was Al early on and Al still. I don't really care. My family
                    always called me Alfred.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well to begin with, could you tell me when and where you
                        were born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Sure. July 24, 1929 in Baltimore, Maryland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then could you tell me a little bit about the family.
                        Let's take your father's side. Where did it come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: My father's family, the Moses's, came from Germany, from a small town
                    called Grobropperhausen in the Rhine valley. I have been there. The family lived
                    there for three to four hundred years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were they doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>MOSES: They were dealers in cattle hides. My grandfather came to this country in
                    1872 as a boy of 15, after German Unification.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he come to Baltimore?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: No, he went to Statesville, North Carolina. That is where my father was
                    born.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well why Statesville, North Carolina. I can think of
                        Baltimore being sort of a very much German town, but Statesville, North
                        Carolina?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: There was a family from Grobropperhausen named Wallace. I doubt the name
                    was Wallace in Germany, but it was Wallace in the United States. They were in
                    the medicinal herb business. My grandfather went to Statesville, North Carolina
                    to work for them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fine. Well then did your father grow up in
                        Statesville?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: No. His father died when he was three years of age, and his mother, who
                    was from Baltimore, moved back to Baltimore. My grandfather is buried in
                    Statesville. I visited his grave a few years ago to say the “kaddish,” the
                    Jewish mourner's prayer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what did your father do in Baltimore?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: He was a hat manufacturer. It was his grandfather's business, his maternal
                    grandfather.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did your father go to college?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: He did not. He graduated from an all-boys academic high school first in
                    his class, but he was the oldest son of a widowed mother, and he went to work in
                    the family business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well usually in those days, if you graduated from one of
                        the good high schools, this was probably as good an education as any kid
                        could get anyway.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Well it was good. He was very intelligent. He studied calculus, classical
                    Greek, Latin, German and, of course, English. He was well read. His brother, who
                    was two years younger, graduated first in his class from Johns Hopkins.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well on your mother's side, where did they come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: We only got to my father's father. My father's mother was born in England
                    in 1863 and came here when Abraham Lincoln was president. She came as an infant
                    and lived to be 101, so I knew her very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good heavens.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Her mother was from Grodno, Poland, and her father from Posen,
                    Germany-Poland. Her father, my great-grandfather, moved to England as a boy,
                    where he was apprenticed to a tailor. Her mother went to Manchester from Grodno
                    as a very young girl, and came to the United States with my grandmother in
                    1863.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well how did your mother and father get together?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: In Baltimore. My father moved back to Baltimore when his father died in
                    1890. My mother's family was in Baltimore. Her father's family, their name was
                    Lobe, came from Holland. Her mother's father's name was Bachrach and they came
                    from Germany. The Lobe's came here in 1830, and the Bachrach's in the
                    1840's.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then basically you grew up in Baltimore?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What part of Baltimore?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Northwest Baltimore.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How sort of Jewish was your upbringing? Was this a strong
                        element in your family and neighborhood or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Yes. I went to public school, but I also went to religious school three
                    days a week. We kept the dietary laws. We did not work or ride on the Sabbath
                    from Friday night to Saturday night. My father and I went to synagogue every
                    Saturday. We walked. It was very central to my upbringing, but not to the
                    exclusion of a larger slice of life.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well describe about during the period you were there, the
                        Jewish community in Baltimore.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: The community numbered about 100,000 people. My father's family had been
                    very prominent in the community. My great-grandfather, Michael Simon Levy, had
                    been one of the pillars of the community, one of the major philanthropists, and
                    that carried over to his sons. Less so in my father's generation because the
                    business, which was the hat business, was on the decline.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was straw hats.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Yes. In its day, it was the largest straw hat manufacturer in the
                    world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I recall vividly on the 21st of June...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Fifteenth of May, Straw Hat Day. Here you see a picture of my
                    great-grandfather's straw hat factory, which, as I stated, was at one time the
                    largest straw hat manufacturer in the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well it was the fifteenth of May and then what was the
                        day, was it Labor Day you put your fist through the straw hat?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: I think it was the fifteenth of September. But I have had a great Talmudic
                    debate with a friend as to when you put on a felt hat. The rule is the fifteenth
                    of September, but if Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, comes earlier, you don
                    a felt hat then. So it is May 15 to Rosh Hashanah, or September 15, whichever
                    comes first.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today, we both come from the same generation, I was born
                        in 1928. We know the straw hat culture which is gone.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: It is all gone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, did your family, I heard on the telephone a
                        little while ago that you have a sister named Claire. How many brothers and
                        sisters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: I have two sisters, Claire and Amalie. Amalie is older, Claire the
                    younger.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now what was family life like sort of growing up at
                        home?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Idyllic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk a little about it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: My father was a serious person, highly intelligent, a bit nervous, quite
                    anxious. He always had forebodings of economic disaster.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had been through the depression.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: He had survived the depression. In 1933 my father and mother built a
                    lovely home on an acre of ground in Baltimore. It is still there, a stucco home
                    of some 5000 to 5500 square feet. Next to us was a farm of some 14 acres. Behind
                    us were woods. Down the street were woods. It was a lovely street. We knew all
                    of our neighbors. We had a very stable upbringing. My mother was a college
                    graduate and was also highly intelligent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did she go to college?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Goucher.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course this is the pre-eminent girl's school in
                        Baltimore.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: She graduated in 1924. She was 17 years younger than my father. This was
                    the first and only marriage for both of them. They were both very much involved
                    in community work, my father exclusively in Jewish organizations. He was
                    president of Sinai Hospital and the Board of Jewish Education. My mother, in
                    later years, was president of the women's board of Sinai Hospital. During the
                    war, she was very active in the Red Cross. She headed up training for
                    volunteers. At the time of her death or slightly before she died, she had been
                    president of the Children's Guild in Baltimore which is for children with major
                    physical and emotional problems. Both of my parents were very active in the
                    community, and interested in the world around them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well how about sort of around the dining room table? Were
                        there a lot of discussions about world events?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>MOSES: All the time. We grew up with that. My father would make pronouncements,
                    which may or may not have had a basis in fact. My mother was more inquiring, and
                    she tried to nurture in me and my sisters an interest in the world around us. I
                    was very conscious of world events from early childhood. I remember seeing war
                    cards depicting the Italian atrocities in Ethiopia. The invasion took place in
                    '36. I was seven years old.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: About '36. I remember...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: I remember Munich as if it were yesterday. My mother picked me up at
                    school and said, “There is not going to be a war.” I was so disappointed. Of
                    course, I remember the German invasion of Poland, Friday, September 1, 1939, and
                    two days later the British and French declared war. The invasion was on the 1st
                    of September, and the declaration of war was on the 3rd. I followed maps of the
                    German invasion of Poland and later the German invasion of Russia, and the
                    Russian counterattacks in the winters of '42 and '43; I was intently aware of
                    what was happening around the world. I knew the names of most of the world
                    leaders. I knew the names of every country in the world. I could identify them
                    on maps. There were not that many then.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am sure for you, too, as for me, it was horrible, but a
                        great geography lesson.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Actually, I learned geography from my stamp collection. As I said, I knew
                    the countries; I knew the leaders. I remember King Zog of Albania, the Italian
                    invasion of Albania, King Boris of Bulgaria, and King Michael of Romania. I
                    remember Colonel Beck, the foreign minister of Poland. Ribbentrop, Molotov;
                    those names are like my family in terms of familiarity. I remember Daladier
                    returning to Paris from Munich, Chamberlain to London in September 1938.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting information mainly from the radio or
                        newspapers, the Baltimore Sun?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: The Baltimore Sun is all I read. Also from the radio, but primarily from
                    the newspaper.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now did the enormity of what Hitler was doing to the
                        Jews in Germany prior to the war, was that coming through. I was wondering
                        whether there were Jewish refugees coming to Baltimore or were they mainly
                        directed towards New York?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Oh no, we had hundreds and hundreds. Our family sponsored a few. Our
                    family didn't do as much as we should have done. But in our small Orthodox
                    synagogue in Baltimore after Kristallnacht, a whole congregation came from
                    Frankfurt along with its rabbi. So there must have been a hundred or so in that
                    small synagogue who had survived Kristallnacht.</p>

                        absorbing the enormity of what was happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Yes, and I was not surprised by what we learned when the camps were
                    liberated in January, 1945. I had assumed that Hitler killed most Jews in
                    Germany and beyond.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about in Baltimore. Was there anti-Semitism? One
                        thinks of H.L. Mencken who was the Sage of Baltimore.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: I have read Mencken. Mencken was anti-Semitic.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Well he was always thought of as a curmudgeon. My parents for some reason
                    admired Mencken, I think because he had written for the Baltimore Sun and later
                    the Mercury.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q:??? and he was thought of as being a curmudgeon, and of
                        course the American Language Book and all this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: He was a clever writer. He was anti-Semitic. He was German and lived in
                    West Baltimore where German ethnicity was high. He wasn't a Nazi; he just found
                    Jews to be alien to his culture, and I think, in a way, he probably found them a
                    bit challenging to his intellectual highness.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well in a way he wasn't just anti-Semitic. He was anti

                </p>
                <p>MOSES: He was a curmudgeon.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOSES: He was also anti-black.</p>

                <p>MOSES: Oh totally. Jews weren't allowed to live in certain sections of Baltimore,
                    the better sections. There were country clubs where Jews couldn't go or be
                    members. Many of the businesses in Baltimore didn't hire Jews. Jews were
                    prominent in manufacturing, particularly apparel. Large men's clothing
                    manufacturers were Jewish. Jews were prominent in the professions, particularly
                    medicine. There were prominent Jewish lawyers, but Jewish lawyers were in their
                    firms, Christian lawyers in their firms. The big firms had no Jews. Jews taught
                    in the public school system, but by my time there weren't vast numbers. They
                    owned retail stores. Department stores were primarily, but not exclusively,
                    Jewish. The two largest locally owned department stores, Hutzler Brothers and
                    Hochschild-Kohn's were Jewish. They were the two best department stores in
                    Baltimore. It was a very, if not entirely, segregated city.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I came into the foreign service in 1955, and for all of us
                        in that generation in the foreign service, our absolute must was going over
                        to Baltimore to T.I. Swartz where you could find for 45 bucks you could buy
                        very good suits. And the nice thing about it, any season you could get a
                        summer suit in the middle of the winter in case you were off to Equatorial
                        Guinea or someplace like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Well, Swartz catered to the Foreign Service; it was a big part of their
                    business. I knew the Swartz family. They were lovely people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well they turned out. I remember going to a cocktail party
                        one time and a bunch of foreign service officers were talking about it. We
                        all opened our coats, and we all had the T.I. Swartz label in it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Well, Pic Swartz, whose father was one of the principals in that business
                    is now living in San Antonio.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOSES: I would say yes. But my intellectual interests developed incrementally
                    starting in high school, mushrooming in college and graduate school, and then
                    law school and beyond.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Elementary school? Nothing, except maybe the end of school and lunch
                    hour.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Recess, yes. I liked to fight. I was a poor student in elementary
                    school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a burden to your mother and particularly to your

                </p>
                <p>MOSES: My father determined that I would never go anywhere. In fact after I went
                    on and became “successful,” he said, “Alfred, I never thought you would amount
                    to much.” My older sister was a wonderful student. But I did very poorly in
                    grammar school, not much better in junior high school. I did reasonably well in
                    high school, and by my senior year I was first in my class in college. So I
                    moved along.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In high school, what sorts of activities were you
                        interested in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: I played sports. I did my schoolwork, and really not much else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find dating was pretty well segregated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Yes, I went out almost entirely with Jewish girls in my parents' social
                    circle, which was boring as hell. But when I was still in high school, I met a
                    Catholic girl. I guess I shouldn't say her name. She was terrific, and I went
                    with her for awhile; then we broke off. In college, I dated, if not exclusively,
                    mostly Jewish girls. After college and graduate school, I had a very good lady
                    friend who later married a professor at Yale. She was Catholic, but my wife, who
                    died last year, was Jewish. The woman I am presently seeing is Jewish. My social
                    circle, certainly in Washington, was probably 70% non-Jewish.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOSES: These days, it is hard to remember who is Jewish and who is not
                    Jewish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I grew up in a Protestant family, and my family was a
                        little uncomfortable because I was dating some Catholic girls from
                        Baltimore.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Well, I dated Christian girls at Goucher. Being exclusively Jewish was
                    never a major part of my life, although I am a very serious Jew.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go to high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: A school called Baltimore City College. It was founded in 1839 when the
                    word college could also mean high school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From there where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: To Dartmouth College.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why Dartmouth?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Because my mother liked it. I couldn't have cared less.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the thought of being stuck in the middle of the
                        wilderness bother you at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: I knew nothing. My mother and father traveled to Maine in the summer. One
                    year they motored through New Hampshire with friends. They said to each other,
                    “This is where we would like our sons to go.” I got in but the other son did
                    not. Later he became president of a fairly large oil company that was the family
                    business. The fact is my mother and father, particularly my mother, liked what
                    she saw at Dartmouth, probably the bucolic setting and general ambiance and
                    reputation. She was always attracted to the non-Jewish world. She wanted me and
                    my sisters to make it big by her lights.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOSES: I forgot. I read it 40 years ago. Budd Schulberg went to Dartmouth.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>MOSES: I was sure a city boy and I went to Dartmouth. I ended up liking Dartmouth

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this in a way a natural progression from your interest

                <p>MOSES: Absolutely.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOSES: I knew Europe well. I became fascinated with China. I later studied
                    Chinese in Graduate school. I would say primarily European history. It came to
                    me like a duck to water. I say immodestly I was more aware of what was going on
                    than anybody I knew at college. When I took courses in history, government,
                    economics, related to international relations, I just breezed through.</p>

                        then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: It was for me a bit austere, a bit isolated. At least for the first two
                    years not particularly enjoyable. I struggled my first year just to do fairly
                    well. My sophomore year I did quite well, and my junior and senior years I did
                    even better.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you, I always think of that song, “Dartmouth is in
                        town Again, Run girls Run.” Did you...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: No, the girls all ran when I came to town.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get around to the other colleges?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: All the time. It would be nothing to drive down to Vassar and have a date,
                    leave Vassar at midnight, get back to Dartmouth at five in the morning and go to
                    class. We were crazy. It is a miracle any of us is alive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I didn't have a car, so I hitch hiked.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: I used to get rides with my friends. In my senior year I had a car.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did any professors there particularly grab you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>MOSES: Yes they did. I had a Chinese professor, Wing-Tsit Chan, who was actually
                    a Chinese culturist, but he taught Chinese history and that fascinated me. Then
                    Professor John Adams who wrote his doctoral dissertation at Princeton on the
                    Serbian army's withdrawal to the Adriatic after its defeat by the Austrians in
                    1915.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Over Montenegro and all that. That was very nasty.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Very nasty. Yes, that was his doctoral dissertation. He was a marvelous
                    lecturer, quite theatrical. I spoke this year at our 50th reunion at Dartmouth
                    and recalled things he said. It drew a laugh as it had 50 years ago. I took four
                    or five courses from him and a professor named John Gazley, a good European
                    historian. Those were the three that I was closest to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get much of Balkan History considering...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: A lot from Adams. I knew Balkan history very well. We had a course in
                    Balkan history. Not the Byzantine era, modern Balkan history. It wasn't until I
                    read Norwich's history of Byzantium that was three or four volumes — it goes up
                    to the fall of Constantinople — that I got into the earlier history of the
                    Balkans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you were going through college, were you, in the first

                </p>
                <p>MOSES: No, I didn't go into the military until 1952.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We both missed no more wars you know. I got out in June of
                        1950.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: That is just the right time. The invasion was in June of 1950.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: June 25. We are talking about North Korea going into South

                <p>MOSES: Exactly.</p>

                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>MOSES: I really didn't have a clear idea. I took examinations for graduate school
                    and was accepted. I applied to Princeton's Woodrow Wilson, Fletcher School, and
                    SAIS. I was accepted at all three and went to Woodrow Wilson. I thought I would
                    have a career in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were at the Woodrow Wilson school of Princeton. You
                        were there from what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: I was there one year. It is a two year program. It is the only thing I
                    failed to complete in my life. I still toy with the idea of going back and
                    getting my masters. I have gone back to lecture. I was bored out of my mind. I
                    felt that the students were bright and conscientious, but dull as can be. They
                    were being trained to join the Bureau of the Budget and, unfortunately, that was
                    of no interest to me, rather than broader international relations. I decided to
                    go to law school. I took the examination and was accepted at Harvard. Then I
                    decided I had been in school long enough, so I joined the Navy and asked Harvard
                    if it would defer me, and it did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were in the navy from '52 to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: '56.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '56. What were you doing in the navy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: I was a naval intelligence officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go to naval OCS?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: At Newport, Rhode Island.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And did they then identify you as somebody who could be an
                        intelligence officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: No, not at all. I couldn't pass the eye exam to be a non-restricted line
                    officer, so the only thing I could qualify for was Naval intelligence. The
                    training at Newport was the same for everybody, the same for all seamen
                    recruits. We were the lowest of the low. It was 16 weeks learning how to be an
                    officer aboard ship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then can we talk a bit about what you were doing in
                        naval intelligence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: I was assigned to NSA on the staff of the Chief of Naval Operations.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOSES: The National Security Agency, the same as it is today.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you were part of which essentially in those days was

                </p>
                <p>MOSES: I was monitoring Chinese naval river traffic.</p>

                        well not officer, I was an enlisted man to Monterrey. I monitored Soviet
                        airport things. Great training ground for an awful lot of people I met later
                        on who got involved in the foreign service. Where were you stationed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: In Washington.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOSES: I loved it because I went to law school at night.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go to law school?</hi>

                <p>MOSES: Georgetown.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Georgetown. So this meant you were pretty busy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Yes, and if I was on night duty, which I was part of the time, I went to
                    day school. If I was on duty during the day, I went to night school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you monitoring or were you reading the transcripts of
                        things that were monitored?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: I was reading transcripts.</p>

                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>MOSES: It hardly existed. They had one cruiser, the Chunking, that had been a
                    British cruiser called the Aurora. The Brits gave it to the Kuomintang in '46 or
                    '47. They had some river craft and that was about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there really wasn't much to, but how did you like the
                        navy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: I loved the Navy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At Georgetown Law at a certain point did you sort of
                        branch off to specialize in any particular type of law?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: I don't think there was any specialization then. There were many required
                    courses, some electives. But I had no specialty. Ironically, when I came to
                    Covington, the first thing they had me do which I did for the next 20 years, was
                    tax work. I had never taken a course in taxation in law school. I just learned
                    it on the job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well it is probably the best way to learn it anyway.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: There were others in my age group who were doing tax work. One had been
                    editor-in-chief of the Harvard Law Review. He knew a lot of tax law when he
                    arrived. They all did. I knew nothing. I had never taken a course in tax or
                    accounting. For some reason I was able to adapt. I read at night. So after two
                    or three years, I knew a hell of a lot of tax law.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you got out of the Navy in...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: February 1956.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOSES: No, I graduated from law school the following October, but I took the bar
                    exam in June, '56 before I graduated. I passed the bar and came to work at
                    Covington &amp; Burling in September of 1956 as an associate. I still had not
                    graduated from law school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you gotten married in this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Yes, I was married in November, '55.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the background of your wife?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: She was a graduate of Vassar College with training in education, nursery
                    school, post-nursery school. She taught for a year at the Bank School in New
                    York. Then we got married and she came here. She taught at National Cathedral
                    and at Holton Arms. She set up the program at Holton Junior College to train
                    teachers.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you became a real Washingtonian then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you talk about the law firm when you came in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Yes there were about...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came in about '56?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: I arrived September 19, 1956. There were about 90 lawyers. It was thought
                    to be, and probably was, the best law firm in Washington. The most famous
                    partner was Dean Acheson who had been Secretary of State. He was here. There
                    were two partners more senior than Acheson. One was John Lord O'Brian who was an
                    enormous name at the bar and had been assistant attorney general in WWI. He
                    claimed, with some pride, that he hired J. Edgar Hoover, and I think he did. The
                    head of the firm was Edward Burling, who was a giant of a man both physically
                    and intellectually. He was then in his 80's.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well when you came in, what was sort of the focus of the
                        firm?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>MOSES: In those days it was a Washington practice. A lot of antitrust, a lot of
                    regulatory work. We had a partner named Tommy Austern, who had clerked for
                    Justice Brandeis. He had an enormous regulatory practice before the FTC and the
                    Food and Drug Administration. If he didn't have the biggest law practice in the
                    country, it must have been close to it. We had Hugh Cox who was a superb
                    appellate advocate. Justice Harlan called him the “perfect advocate.” I think my
                    first or second year here, he argued the Dupont, General Motors case. He was a
                    brilliant lawyer, extraordinarily cultured, well read, refined. Gerry Gesell,
                    later a federal district court judge, was a marvelous trial lawyer. Howard
                    Westwood and others represented the transportation industry, American Airlines,
                    the American Transportation Association, major railroads, the Pennsylvania
                    Railroad, and other major U.S. corporations such as Dupont. I remember doing
                    work for the biggest companies in the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did lawyers work in this environment? I mean your law
                        firm doing, what would you do as a lawyer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: When I came in, I was assigned to work for a tax partner. I did tax work
                    for two or three years. I also was sent to Legal Aid. So for six months I spent
                    my time with Legal Aid trying cases, which was my m�tier. I loved that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What does that mean trying cases?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: I was representing indigents in the District on whatever problems they
                    had. The most personal problems, family relations, government benefit claims,
                    various kinds of harassment suits. I was also for the next ten years or so
                    assigned by the district court to represent defendants in criminal cases. I was
                    in the courts a good deal. I did both tax work and litigation. Starting in '62 I
                    was doing more litigation, less tax work. From that my practice evolved into
                    doing representational work for clients around the country, around the world on
                    whatever their problems were. A lot of litigation, but an enormous amount of
                    negotiation, business agreements, whatever.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am looking at the time now, and I will put at the end
                        here, so we will know where to pick this up. We are talking about the mid
                        '50's. You talked about your work in the law firm. I would like to ask about
                        sort of the legal atmosphere in Washington, DC in the late '50's, still the
                        Eisenhower period. Also, since you did legal aid, the justice system and the
                        government system in Washington, DC and then we will talk about any interest
                        you have in the politics, because that is Washington. And we will talk about
                        some of the clients you had and what you were doing and all that.</hi>

                        a bit about the 1950's and all. What was, you know things change a lot. In
                        the 1950's what would you say the legal climate was? I mean was there sort
                        of the K Street corridor of lobbyists or was it a different feeling?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>MOSES: That is a fair question. I wasn't aware of lobbying. My law firm,
                    Covington &amp; Burling, didn't lobby. I think in those days we weren't
                    registered under the Lobbying Act. But we worked on matters that had high public
                    identification and interest. We worked on the deportation of the former dictator
                    of Venezuela. Hugh Cox argued the Dupont, General Motors case which may have
                    been the most celebrated antitrust case since the breakup of Standard Oil under
                    Theodore Roosevelt. We represented American Airlines, which was very high
                    profile, on route applications. We represented the Pennsylvania Railroad that
                    was the dominant railroad in the East. We represented major corporations.
                    Dupont. I remember Gillette came and asked me to work on their foreign tax
                    issues. I did the reorganization of Interpublic, an advertising agency, a very
                    complex matter. But lobbying wasn't part of what Covington &amp; Burling did,
                    and it is something I never did as such other than on a pro bono basis for
                    public interest groups. The major law firms at that time were Covington, which
                    was the largest law firm, Hogan &amp; Hartson, which was more of a local firm,
                    in the Colorado Building in downtown Washington. Arnold &amp; Porter, and, of
                    course, then Abe Fortas' name was in the firm. It was Arnold, Fortas &amp;
                    Porter. It was a prominent firm. And about that time I think Lloyd Cutler and
                    John Pickering along with Mr. Wilmer set up Wilmer, Cutler, and Pickering. That
                    was certainly a superb law firm. The out of town law firms weren't here. I think
                    in the '50's there was no New York firm, other than Cleary Gottlieb, that had
                    both a Washington office and a New York office. It was quite fraternal. You had
                    the uptown bar which we were part of, and then you had the so-called 5th Street
                    lawyers who did the criminal work, the street crime work, and tort work. There
                    were some very good plaintiff's lawyers, David Bress, later a United States
                    attorney, and Joe Bowman who was a good plaintiff's lawyer, and others. And
                    there were a few well known criminal lawyers. Edward Bennett Williams, of
                    course, but in the mid '50's Ed Williams hadn't come into the prominence he did
                    in succeeding decades, nor had Paul Connolly. Paul was still at Hogan &amp;
                    Hartson. Ed I think, was on his own by then. But it was a much smaller bar, and
                    it was much more local. The divisions were between those who were born in
                    Washington or went to law schools in this area, GW and Georgetown, and the
                    uptown bar which was populated by lawyers such as myself who were not born in
                    Washington and went to Ivy League schools. I had gone to Dartmouth and
                    Princeton, but I came here and went to Georgetown Law School, so I had my feet
                    on both sides of the line, which was a great advantage. I knew local people,
                    particularly those who graduated around my time. Having gone to Georgetown, I
                    felt some affinity to the District Court here which was then populated by judges
                    who had graduated from Georgetown. Bo Laws was the chief judge. He had gone to
                    Georgetown. On the Court of Appeals were Barrett Prettyman and others who had
                    gone to Georgetown. I think Judge Fahey had gone to Georgetown as well. Many of
                    the judges before whom I tried cases were Georgetown graduates. I don't know
                    whether that helped or hurt, but I had some pride in being able to say to
                    myself, I had gone to the same law school as the judge. We had, I think, more of
                    a sense of fraternity and collegiality than exists today.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have the feeling that today you know there is such a
                        sense of partisanship. I mean you fall in one place or another. Is that a

                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Well, I have never seen it as acute as it is today. I think this crowd is
                    almost Stalinist. I signed an ad for John Kerry along with a hundred or so other
                    former ambassadors. John Eisenhower signed as well. I have been taken to task by
                    people in the Administration for having signed that ad. I just came back from
                    Geneva where our Ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, Kevin Moley, barely
                    talks to me today. Rudy Boschwitz, a former senator who is chairing the U.S.
                    delegation, is very critical of my having signed the ad. I said to Rudy, “Look,
                    this is a democracy.” He took great exception to that, too. I have never seen a
                    crowd that is as partisan, hard nosed and takes no prisoners. You are either
                    with 'em or against 'em.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much did you get involved in international things. You
                        talk about American airlines. At that time were they looking for
                        international routes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: No, at that time there were no overseas routes. The only American flag
                    carriers that flew overseas in the '50's were Pan Am and TWA. American, United,
                    Delta, all flew in the United States. Some had routes to South America. Eastern
                    had some South American routes. Others may have as well. But the answer is, no,
                    they were not international. My interest was international because of my
                    background; I was from birth interested in international relations. In the
                    '50's, it was the Eisenhower era. I didn't start practice until September of
                    '56. Stevenson was running for the second time against Eisenhower and got
                    clobbered. I think most of the partners in our firm were Democrats. Some very
                    important partners were Republicans. I think the majority of the partners were
                    Democrats, and a vast majority of the associates were Democrats. By the '60
                    election, I was involved in a minor way with the Kennedy election. But up to
                    that point I wasn't doing anything internationally at all, at least that I can
                    recall. It wasn't until after that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much of sort of an international representation
                        in the law firms.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Yes, Covington had an international law practice. Dean Acheson was the
                    senior partner. A man named John Laylin was a senior partner, not as senior as
                    Mr. Acheson. He was representing Pakistan in the Kashmir dispute. Howard
                    Westwood represented Venezuela in the deportation of Jim�nez. We were
                    representing some mining companies in South America. But other law firms also
                    had well developed international practices. At that time the Washington law
                    practice, the uptown practice, was largely antitrust and dealing with the
                    federal government on behalf of clients outside Washington. More of the
                    international work was done in New York, not Washington.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned the Jim�nez case. You were involved in

                <p>MOSES: I was not. Howard Westwood did that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: The issue was whether he would be deported. He was the former dictator of
                    Venezuela. I don't know what the issues were, whether it was the legality of his
                    entry into the United States or the crimes he was charged with in Venezuela that
                    made him subject to deportation, but a lot of bodies at Covington were devoted
                    to the case. Howard brought in Sid Sachs, a friend of mine, from the DC Bar
                    Association, now dead for 15 years, to help in the trial. Sid was a former
                    assistant U.S. attorney and knew the local bar very well. I was not involved in
                    the Jim�nez deportation case. I didn't handle international matters until much
                    later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he deported?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Yes.</p>

                <p>MOSES: At that time Covington assigned associates to spend half time at Legal
                    Aid. Early on in my tenure at Covington, I was spending time at Legal Aid
                    handling whatever matters came over the transom. A lot of it was litigation. I
                    remember trying one interesting matter for a woman named Helen Stevenson. She
                    had been married to a Naval Academy graduate named Stevenson. He died, and she
                    remarried. Her second marriage was annulled, but the second husband died before
                    the statutory appeal period had expired. Her second husband had 30 days to
                    appeal and died on the 29th day. She then applied to receive a pension as the
                    unremarried widow of Stevenson. The Veterans Administration turned her down on
                    grounds that she remarried. The case was before Judge McGuire in the United
                    States District Court. I filed a long brief, something we don't do anymore. The
                    judge decided that she was the unremarried widow of her first husband. One
                    interesting fact I left out: She didn't get the annulment. It was more
                    complicated. The Veterans Administration said she was the widow of her second
                    husband, because the annulment did not become final until the time for taking an
                    appeal had expired or, if an appeal was taken and perfected, until it was
                    decided. I came up with the argument, sort of a nunc pro tunc argument, “now for
                    then.” That he didn't file the appeal, and having not filed an appeal, there was
                    no intervening event, and once he died, the 30-day period expired and the
                    annulment became final. Judge McGuire agreed with me, but it was a lesson in
                    humility. He didn't pay any attention to my legal arguments. He said, “This
                    isn't fair.” That was the end of it. The assistant U.S. Attorney said, “I agree
                    with you, Judge.” So I won that one, not on the merits, but on the sympathy of
                    the judge.</p>
                <p>Then I had another case in juvenile court for a poor fellow that was divorced. He
                    wasn't making any money. I loved the little guy. His wife was running around.
                    She found another guy which was the cause of the divorce. She hauled my guy into
                    Juvenile Court for failure to make support payments. The guy didn't have any
                    money. He was hustling as best he could. He actually put aside a couple of
                    dollars on a sled for his children. In those days you put money down at the
                    store and you paid it off the best you could. I felt so sorry for the fellow.
                    His wife was a no-gooder and he was trying as best he could and working as hard
                    as he could. I argued that case before Marjorie Lawson who was the Juvenile
                    Court judge. Marjorie liked my argument and later got me to work for Kennedy in
                    the 1960 presidential race. She was co-chair of the Minority Rights Committee
                    for Kennedy. She was Afro-American. She and Belford, her husband, were very
                    prominent in the local bar. He was a good trial lawyer. Marjorie was a good
                    political operator and a smart lady. She also persuaded me to represent Bethune
                    College in Florida. Mary Bethune was head of the National Association of Negro
                    Women. This is all from the late 50's or early '60's.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah, during the 50's at this time, how would you describe
                        from sort of the law perspective and the law firm and all, the status of
                        African Americans?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>MOSES: As best as I can recall, none of the white firms had Afro-American
                    lawyers. Covington hired its first Afro-American lawyer in the 60's, a man named
                    Tyrone Brown who had gone to Cornell Law School and clerked for Chief Justice
                    Warren. Ty was assigned to work for me. Long before I had asked one of the
                    partners why Covington didn't hire Afro-American lawyers. His response was, “We
                    can't find any qualified Afro-Americans.” The one who would have been qualified,
                    Bill Coleman, who later became Secretary of Transportation, had been a Supreme
                    Court clerk for Justice Frankfurter. He went to the Gibson Dunn firm after he
                    was Secretary of Transportation. I believe he was later its managing partner.
                    Bill now is in his 80's. But I am not sure Covington went after Bill Coleman. It
                    is a little bit like the George Marshall story. He was asked in the 1960s why
                    the Redskins didn't have any Afro-American football players. He said, “I tried
                    to hire Bobby Mitchell, but the Cleveland Browns wouldn't sell him.” What he did
                    was call the owner of the Browns, Paul Brown, and ask, “Would you sell or trade
                    Bobby Mitchell?” Paul said, “Nothing doing.” That was the extent of his trying.
                    This is when Mitchell was a standout running back for the Cleveland Browns.
                    Bobby later played here. He is a friend of mine, he and his wife Gwen. Then
                    Marshall was gone and the new ownership brought in tons of African American ball
                    players. I guess the great majority of players in the NFL today are African
                    American. But there weren't African American lawyers in white firms in the 50's.
                    There were African American lawyers trying cases, some very good ones. Turkey
                    Thompson who later set up an insurance company here became a Superior Court
                    judge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that the law system as you saw it was fair
                        toward the African Americans or was there a bias? How would you describe
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: It is hard to say. I am sure there was bias. The first African American
                    judge in D.C. may have been Marjorie, and she was on the Juvenile Court. There
                    were no African American judges on the federal District Court, the Court of
                    Appeals, or the Supreme Court. In the Municipal Court I don't think there were
                    any African American judges except in the Juvenile Court section. That all
                    changed. Aubrey Robinson was one of the early African American judges. He was on
                    the Municipal Court and later became chief judge of the U.S. District Court.
                    There were two or three others. Aubrey, and Bill Bryant. They didn't come to the
                    Municipal Court until the late 50's or early 60's. Later they were both chief
                    judges of the U.S. District Court.</p>

                        were you doing and what was your feeling about this, because this was sort

                <p>MOSES: I don't have a clear recollection. First, let me state I traveled with the
                    entourage from Saturday night before the election through the election and on to
                    Hyannisport. The morning after the election I talked with Bobby Kennedy. It was
                    very exciting. I didn't have a real role. The fact is that Marjorie, as a payoff
                    for legal work I had done for her various causes, just put me on the campaign
                    plane. I wasn't assigned to do a thing and I didn't do anything. I had no real
                    involvement in anything other than being an up-close spectator. It was strange.
                    I would have liked to have done things, but didn't sign on early enough to be
                    given responsibility, and in the end it was simply a payoff for things I had
                    done for Marjorie. It was an interesting time. John Kennedy was not the hero he
                    later became. Among the people I knew, he was probably the third choice to be
                    the Democratic candidate, after Chester Bowles and Hubert Humphrey.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was sort of a lightweight senator wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: He was considered a medium-weight senator, largely a creature of his
                    father's political payoffs and maneuvering. He was known to be ambitious. In the
                    Democratic primaries Kennedy knocked off Humphrey in West Virginia and elsewhere
                    with a lot of brass knuckles and money spreading. The Kennedy's were a tough
                    crowd, a lot tougher than the Ivy League boys that I ran with. A hell of a lot
                    less naive. But I saw all those fellows up close. I saw Kennedy in Watertown,
                    Connecticut at 1:00 in the morning the Sunday before the election. He started
                    giving his talk about Stanley Baldwin, Why England Slept, which was the name of
                    his book. Thousands of people were in the street; it was terrible weather, cold
                    and raining — women with hair curlers. He looked out at the crowd and started
                    laughing at the irony of it all. He was talking about Baldwin in Watertown,
                    Connecticut, an industrial city. People didn't know whom he was talking about.
                    It got to him. Earlier in the day the motorcade headed in the wrong direction on
                    the Long Island Expressway. Kennedy had his driver stop; he jumped out and went
                    into a gas station to ask for directions to wherever we were going. It was Great
                    Neck or some other place. This was the human part. There were enormous crowds.
                    In Burlington, Vermont, he spoke in a hangar. I was standing next to Arthur
                    Schlesinger, Jr. I asked him whether he had foreseen the enthusiastic support.
                    As you know, Arthur Schlesinger is terribly pompous. He said, “Oh yes, blah,
                    blah.” I said to myself, bullshit. But he was a great wordsmith and a preeminent
                    historian. Kennedy wanted his help on speeches.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He seemed to collect an aura of people who were
                        intellectuals, but they seemed to be used as tools.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Kennedy? Oh he kept them around as adornments, absolutely. I got to know
                    quite a few of his people. I used to play tennis regularly with Stewart Udall.
                    Stewart stayed on for eight years. Stayed on with Johnson. I got to know Stewart
                    very well.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Yes. He was from Arizona, and a good Secretary of the Interior. I worked
                    with him on saving Merrywood, Jackie Kennedy's ancestral home, when the
                    Auchincloss family sold it to a developer for a high-rise apartment. I came up
                    with the notion of placing a scenic easement on the property; Stewart Udall
                    agreed. The scenic easement blocked high-rises. Then I got the Internal Revenue
                    Service to rule that persons who donated scenic easements could take a tax
                    deduction for the value of the easement. The neighbors around Merrywood did
                    this. The story was on the front page of The Wall Street Journal — not my name
                    but the ruling I had obtained for my client, one of the neighbors. I went to the
                    Hill to testify on scenic easements. Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Jr. was on the
                    committee. So I was playing at a low level with some interesting issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your feeling about Robert Kennedy and his
                        operation at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Fact be known, most of the people I knew had a low opinion of Bobby. We
                    remembered him from his McCarthy days. He was on McCarthy's staff headed by Roy
                    Cohn. We thought Cohn was lower than a snake.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Robert Kennedy, they were nasty.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: They were very nasty. And they were chewing up people who couldn't defend
                    themselves given the setting, many of whom had flirted with or had indeed been
                    involved with the Communist Party 10, 15, 20 years before. They were pretty much
                    hopeless, helpless knaves. Bobby was very acerbic, very tough, as was Cohn who
                    turned out to be a dastardly figure, a smart guy, but a real bastard. He sent
                    shock waves through this town and through the country. So the opinion of Bobby
                    was lower than the opinion of his brother which was not very high either. That
                    all changed. Bobby became Attorney General which shocked everybody. The
                    consensus was it was a bad appointment. He wasn't qualified and being the
                    President's brother raised all kinds of issues, but he turned out to be a
                    stellar Attorney General. He brought in a first class team of assistant
                    attorneys general, and switched from being a very tough prosecutor to being a
                    person committed to the underclass in America. Was it genuine or was it
                    political convenience? Who's to say?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I always had a hard time reconciling this. I never warmed
                        up to the warm lovable Bobby Kennedy.</hi>

                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>MOSES: I don't think he was ever warm and lovable. He was always a tough guy, but
                    he inspired great loyalty. He and Ethel. Ethel was tougher than he. She is still
                    alive and living not far from us. She was as tough as could be. But their public
                    persona was rather magical, as was John Kennedy's.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Well, John Kennedy wasn't as good a president as his image. We now know
                    that he was very much handicapped by Addison's Disease, a lot of pain. He spent
                    gobs of time chasing women. Robert Kennedy called one woman secretary in our
                    firm asking if she would go out with his brother, Jack, who had seen her on
                    television. She said she turned it down. Whether the story was true or not true
                    I don't know. She was a beautiful woman. She was a niece of Tris Speaker who had
                    been an outfielder for the Cleveland Indians and who gave us the memorable
                    phrase about Walter Johnson, the “Big Train,” who pitched for the Washington
                    Senators in the 1920's. His line was, “You can't hit 'em if you can't see
                    'em.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Yes, race was the big issue in the 60's. It was the major domestic issue.
                    I went to the first swearing in of the second chairman of the EEOC, a friend,
                    Stephen Shulman. Johnson spoke. He wasn't impressive, but there it was in the
                    Roosevelt Room in the White House. I was very much involved in what we thought
                    was important work in the Afro-American community, the black community. I was
                    president of Hospitality House which was almost entirely Afro-American. We were
                    pushing very hard.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOSES: First of all, I was at Covington &amp; Burling, probably the most
                    prestigious law firm in Washington. So I was starting out at a great advantage.
                    Whatever I did in terms of civil rights was done at little cost to me. I don't
                    deserve much credit. It wasn't a sacrifice of income or anything else. I enjoyed
                    doing it; I believed in it, but it wasn't at my personal sacrifice. The local
                    schools were desegregated right after Brown vs. Board of Education in 1954.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was around '54.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>MOSES: '54. The restaurants I think, were desegregated at the same time, but
                    there certainly was no equality. I don't believe there were any Afro-American
                    families living in white neighborhoods other than Georgetown which had a lot of
                    Afro-Americans living there 80 to 100 years before. But the only Afro-American
                    families that remained when I lived there were remnants of emancipated slaves.
                    They had extremely modest homes. A lot of churches were Afro-American, still
                    are, but the congregations had moved across town. We moved to Virginia in 1960;
                    it was the same thing. The persons who had come to Virginia in the preceding 20
                    or 30 years and lived in more affluent sections of McLean were all white. There
                    were black families, but they lived in areas that were exclusively black; they
                    had been there for 100 years or more. I tried to register them to vote which was
                    thought to be a big thing. I would go house-to-house and ask them if they had
                    registered. Many of them hadn't. They were very proud people. I think some of
                    them were educated; certainly their children were educated. They lived in their
                    communities far longer than we had.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Never did in law. I haven't until this day other than to represent
                    businesses abroad, and a few individuals. I represented lots of businesses that
                    were multinational or located abroad. That just evolved over time. However, I
                    did become increasingly involved in Middle East issues in the 70's.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Well, the springboard for everything I have done in the international
                    field was my organizational affiliation in the Jewish community. I was chair of
                    the Washington chapter of the American Jewish Committee in the late 60's. I was
                    in my 30's. The national president was Arthur Goldberg. I used that as a
                    springboard to become increasingly involved in Middle East affairs,
                    Israel-related issues, and refugee issues. That is what got me to Romania. That
                    is how I became ambassador to Romania two decades later. I also chaired the
                    committee on behalf of the organized Jewish community that negotiated with the
                    Business Roundtable on the law passed by the Congress making it illegal for
                    Americans to participate in the boycott of Israel. I testified in the House and
                    Senate. As I said, I chaired the negotiating committee on behalf of the
                    organized Jewish community. There were three of us: Max Kampelman who later was
                    Counselor at the Department of State, and Paul Berger, a Washington lawyer. Max
                    was our leader.</p>

                <p>MOSES: Max's book mentions that this was probably the springboard for his later
                    being named chair of the U.S. Delegation to the Helsinki Talks. He wasn't the
                    original chair; he was co-chair, but he ended up being chair when Griffin Bell,
                    former Attorney General under Carter, resigned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A prominent figure during the Watergate hearings wasn't
                        he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: No, I don't think so. He was a judge on the Fifth Circuit and then
                    Attorney General. He had resigned for personal reasons and gone back to Atlanta.
                    Carter appointed him chair of the Helsinki Delegation; Max was number two. Max
                    really went to work, was effective, and I think Judge Bell acquiesced to Max's
                    de facto leadership, and after a time resigned. I am quite sure there was no
                    friction. Our effort in opposing the Arab Boycott is how I first met Paul
                    Sarbanes and started working with him. I met with a lot of the key figures in
                    the Senate and the House and the White House. I started before Carter was
                    elected. I originally was involved in '75 when Elliot Richardson was Secretary
                    of Commerce, Bill Simon was at Treasury and Kissinger at State.</p>

                <p>MOSES: I loathed Nixon. I thought he was an absolute scoundrel, unbalanced, a
                    mean-spirited scoundrel that was Machiavellian, mentally unsteady. He was a very

                    believed in it or whether he thought it was politically expedient. His main
                    interest was foreign policy. He had Pat Moynihan for a time as his domestic
                    policy advisor. Moynihan was a carryover from Rockefeller days. Both Kissinger
                    and Moynihan started with Rockefeller. Kissinger became a complete chameleon. I
                    don't know whom I trusted less, Nixon or Kissinger. Kissinger may have been the

                    let anyone else share the glory. He wanted to get involved in anything that had
                    any profile, but he screwed it up starting with SALT I. What else? The
                    negotiations with the Viet Cong could have ended the war in '68, but it was he
                    or Anna Chennault (Mrs. Claire Chennault) who told Viet Nam President Nguyen Van
                    Thieu he would get a better deal from the Republicans than President Johnson was
                    offering. Thieu pulled out of the negotiations. It took five years to negotiate
                    the deal with the Viet Cong. Tens of thousands of American boys were killed. We
                    ended up with a national disaster. D�tente was a mistake. Kissinger never
                    understood the moral superiority of the West and the fragility of the communist
                    world. He wanted to create a Metternichian balance of power in Europe. He failed
                    to see (or at least acknowledge) the atrophy that had occurred in the Soviet
                    Union. Stalin had killed many would-have-been future leaders, repressed dissent,
                    devastated agriculture and set the Soviet empire on a course that could only
                    lead to economic and political stagnation. Even in Kissinger's day, the
                    handwriting was on the wall. Brezhnev was desperately trying to hold the pieces
                    together. Communist theology had become empty slogans, a mantra chanted, but not
                    believed. Uprisings in East Germany in 1953, Budapest in 1956, and Prague in
                    1969 made it clear that, given the chance, countries under Soviet occupation
                    would bolt. Kissinger wanted to keep the lid on, not risk confrontation with the
                    Soviet Union. He came up with the wonderful phrase “organic links” between the
                    Soviet Union and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe as a way to
                    stabilize the region. He was simply dreadful.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well during this time as you were involved with Jewish
                        organizations, did you see a change or a split or something between, you
                        know at one point I think almost everybody in the United States thought
                        Israel was great and all this, and the Palestinians were sort of a
                        peripheral group and all. It took quite awhile before all of a sudden the
                        realization came that there was something else. They were also people with
                        aspirations.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>MOSES: It is more complicated than that if you will permit me. Early on, Israel
                    was not held in high regard in this country. The government was thought to be
                    socialist, and it was. The country was thought to be largely non-religious, and
                    it was, and its mere existence was considered by the foreign policy
                    establishment to be contrary to our interests. Truman's decision to recognize
                    Israel, which historians can argue about, I would like to think was taken for
                    humanitarian reasons, not political reasons. Goodness knows, at one time or
                    another he stuck his thumb in the eyes of everybody in this country including
                    organized labor. He went to the Hill to draft the railroad workers into the
                    army. He took on John L. Lewis; he took on virtually everyone. He was a feisty
                    guy. He made the decision largely because six million Jews had been killed in
                    the Holocaust, and he believed Jews deserved a country of their own. As you
                    know, once he made a decision there was no looking back. The relationship
                    between Israel and the Truman Administration in the ensuing four years was not
                    close. Truman recognized Israel's independence, de facto in '48; he was in
                    office until January of '53. During that period the prime minister of Israel
                    never visited the White House. This coolness continued under Eisenhower,
                    particularly with the Suez War. The British and French, together with Israel,
                    clobbered Egypt. Eisenhower ordered the Israelis to pull out of the Sinai in
                    February of '56. The issue in those days was not the Palestinians; it was more
                    the Arab world, our friendship with the Saudis and others. People in Washington
                    had a real chip on their shoulder regarding Israel. The State Department crowd
                    was very frosty towards Israel. I remember former Assistant Secretary of State
                    Lucius Battle telling me in '82 when Israel invaded Lebanon, “Tell your soldiers
                    to get out of there.” “OK, Luke, what do I tell, the Marines, the U.S. Army, the
                    U.S. Navy?” He said, “No, you tell your Israeli soldiers.” I said, “Luke, you
                    are confused. I am American.” I think he was anti-Semitic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well I think it was more than that. I mean there were
                        other things because you know I think it has often been put that the people
                        who are involved in middle eastern affairs went there for love of Arab. It
                        was maybe a career thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Sure it was career driven, but there was also resentment. State always
                    felt that Truman recognized Israel for political purposes over the objection of
                    General Marshall who was Secretary of State at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think he was Secretary of State at the time. If I recall
                        it was that, and Marshall said you shouldn't do it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>MOSES: Marshall said, “I am not sure I can support you in the '48 election if you
                    recognize Israel.” That was really something, but the President, being the guy
                    he was, called it the way he saw it. But there was resentment. By the 60's when
                    AIPAC was operating effectively on the Hill, there was the sense that
                    Congressional interference negatively impacted U.S. foreign policy. The attitude
                    at State was, “We decide what U.S. foreign policy should be.” A decade later,
                    Zbigniew Brzezinski, then National Security Advisor, was interviewed by the
                    Kuwaiti press. He was asked, in effect, would American foreign policy be
                    different if it weren't for the influence of the Jewish community in the
                    Congress. Zbig answered, “I can't answer that question. What you are really
                    asking me is would American foreign policy be different if we were not a
                    democracy. The answer is yes, it would be different if we weren't a democracy,
                    but we are a democracy.” That was a great answer. But I heard all during this
                    period that Jews were using their political influence to twist and bend American
                    foreign policy in favor of Israel.</p>

                <p>MOSES: Oh, no question. When we get there, I will tell you about it. Sure. But I
                    think your question is when did the country come to realize that the crux of the
                    issue was the Palestinians and their aspirations. That was clearly recognized by
                    1976 with the Brookings Report that Bill Quandt wrote. Carter took that as his
                    bible. That is the policy he followed until Sadat went to Jerusalem in November,
                    1977. So the recognition that the issue was Palestinian-Israeli was clearly
                    postulated in '76 with the Brookings Report.</p>

                <p>MOSES: It made sense up to a point. It was written by Bill and others, but
                    primarily Bill. His wife is Palestinian. The issue was Palestinian-Israeli. But
                    the Palestinian leader was Arafat, and he turned out to be an unreliable
                    interlocutor and negotiator. I was on the White House lawn in August '93 when
                    Arafat signed the Oslo Accords with Rabin and Peres. I would not shake Arafat's
                    hand. He had ordered the murder of the American ambassador in Khartoum and the
                    Station Chief. A dastardly person. But Clinton was always forgiving. Being a
                    great politician, he realized you had to deal with Arafat or no one.</p>

                        you find it because it had changed quite a bit. APAC, the American...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: AIPAC, the American-Israeli Public Affairs Committee, was started in the
                    50's by Si Kenen, who was effective on the Hill, a good lobbyist. Initially,
                    AIPAC had some non-Jewish board members. Over time it has made an enormous
                    difference. The first visit by a prime minister to the White House was by Eschol
                    in 1964 when Johnson was President. The first American military planes sold to
                    Israel were under Kennedy. A far bigger sale took place under Johnson after the
                    Six Day War when we sold Phantoms to Israel. Rabin was here then as ambassador.
                    He had a great deal of influence, particularly with the U.S. military which
                    traditionally had been anti-Israel. It is entirely different today. There were
                    no Jews of influence in the upper echelons of State or DOD. Ironically both
                    Nixon's Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State were Jewish by birth.
                    Kissinger was almost a Jewish apologist. He certainly made it difficult for
                    Israel. Indeed, during the Yom Kippur War, until the President intervened,
                    Kissinger's policy was to let Israel bleed. Then it would have to come to him
                    and he would be able to control the situation. Very Machiavellian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is tape 2 side 1 with Alfred Moses.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: He had no affinity with the Jewish community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Schlesinger.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: He was Secretary of Defense. He had no affinity with the Jewish community.
                    He had converted to the Lutheran faith while at Harvard. Nor did Kissinger
                    despite the fact that his father was Orthodox and he grew up in an Orthodox
                    home. He divorced his first wife who was Jewish. His second wife, Nancy, is not
                    Jewish. Most of the people of influence in the DOD, both in uniform and
                    non-uniform, were at best frosty towards Israel. AIPAC changed this through its
                    ability to rally support on the Hill, particularly in the Senate. When Kissinger
                    went to Israel in September 1975 and talked about a “reassessment,” there was a
                    letter from 96 senators saying, “No, Mr. Secretary.” So the political hammer was
                    quite influential with the Ford Administration and with succeeding
                    administrations. Every president knows there are limits as to how far he can go
                    without running into a major fight on the Hill.</p>

                    Johnson and Ford. I was close to Phil Buchen, Ford's counsel. The Ford
                    Administration was wonderful to work with. I met with President Ford on several
                    occasions. But Nixon, no.</p>

                    representing the Kennedy Center. Leonard Garment in the Nixon White House was
                    enormously helpful to me on Kennedy Center matters. I had no dealings with the
                    Nixon Administration on behalf of the Jewish community. I didn't become active
                    until the Ford years in terms of speaking to the White House, going up on the
                    Hill, for Jewish causes.</p>

                <p>MOSES: Yes. I chaired the negotiations with the Business Roundtable on the
                    anti-Arab Boycott legislation on behalf of a broad coalition of Jewish
                    organizations and was at the White House frequently garnering support for the
                    agreement we struck with the Business Roundtable. Commerce and State were
                    opposed; they were still operating under the Ford Administration's script.</p>

                    that did business with a company that did business with Israel. An office of the
                    Arab League sent questionnaires to companies doing business primarily in Saudi
                    Arabia. The legislation made it illegal for an American company to respond to
                    that questionnaire.</p>

                        one in Israel. So they were going to boycott IBM. The Egyptians said, “Wait
                        a minute. Our entire military mobilization scheme is based on the IBM cards.
                        We can't do this.” Did it seem to be an effective boycott or not?</hi>

                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>MOSES: It is hard to say. It certainly discouraged doing business with Israel and
                    investing in Israel, even doing business with companies that did business in
                    Israel, depending on the company's clout. They didn't want to take on an IBM,
                    but smaller businesses, sure. I testified at the Congressional hearings in the
                    House and Senate. So did a spokesman for Dresser Industries who said, “ We don't
                    comply with the boycott, but we think it is bad legislation because the Saudis
                    will react negatively, and hurt U.S. businesses.” “All business-related
                    legislation,” Senator Sarbanes replied, “has some impact on business, starting
                    with the Social Security Act. Moreover, if you are not complying with the
                    boycott, what difference does it make to Dresser?” Dresser's spokesman did not
                    answer. Not all businesses were opposed. General Mills supported the legislation
                    solely as a matter of principle; they thought the boycott was wrong. I
                    immediately went out and bought General Mills stock.</p>

                    was controversial, but the Reagan Administration was on my side. We used the
                    legislation to get Jews out of Romania. Its status was up for renewal every
                    year, and if the Jewish community had opposed it, it wouldn't have passed. We
                    fought very hard. I had a two-day meeting in Washington over a July 4 weekend in
                    1979 when that was the issue. Romania sent a special emissary, its former
                    ambassador to the United States, Cornelia Bogdan. We pushed him very hard. We
                    ended up with an agreement so that any Jew who wanted to leave Romania could
                    leave. A list of Jews applying would be given to the Chief Rabbi and he, in
                    turn, gave it to me. We were equally effective on boycott matters. But Jewish
                    emigration from Romania did not touch at all on what I was doing on the Arab
                    Boycott.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well this is your first real contact on the Romanian
                        issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: I went to Romania in '76 on my way back from Israel. Young people came up
                    to me on the street asking me to help get them out. I did that until Ceausescu
                    fell in '89, 13 years later. That brought me in contact with a lot of people
                    such as Zbig Brzezinski who was then in the White House; he was very helpful. I
                    met with Carter's counsel, Bob Lipshutz, who was also helpful. In the 80's I
                    worked closely with Roz Ridgeway, Assistant Secretary of State for European
                    affairs. Mark Palmer was then the regional director at State and later
                    ambassador to Hungary. Tom Simons, a few years later our ambassador to Poland,
                    also pitched in, as did Martin Wenick. Whenever I asked to come over, State was
                    receptive. It was the same earlier at the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs (NEA)
                    when Hal Saunders was Assistant Secretary. I met with him regularly. Also his
                    predecessor, Roy Atherton. Hal asked me to write the first draft of what became
                    the Camp David Accords. It was an amazing time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the whole Camp David
                        negotiations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: It was a bit surreal. For 13 days Sadat and Begin did not talk to each
                    other except the first day and the last. Carter did the shuttling. Saunders did
                    most of the drafting. He came out with a marvelous document. I later met with
                    Sadat in 1980 in his home in Mit Abul Kom in the Nile delta. His only regret was
                    that, in his words, Begin did not have the courage to go on with the Palestinian
                    part of the Accords. The Camp David Accords had two parts. One,
                    Egyptian-Israeli, the other Palestinian-Israeli, that called for Palestinian
                    autonomy. Begin signed the document that recognized “the legitimate rights of
                    the Palestinian people.” He went quite far. It did not call for an independent
                    Palestinian state as our policy is today, but it was the first recognition by
                    Israel of the political right of the Palestinians to govern themselves. Sadat
                    was the most impressive public figure I ever met. He was a true visionary and a
                    strategic thinker. It was he, not Kissinger, who orchestrated the disengagement
                    agreements in the Sinai preceding his visit to Jerusalem in November 1977. Two
                    weeks after Sadat was assassinated, I visited Cairo to meet with Hosni Mubarak,
                    Sadat's successor. Mubarak reaffirmed Egypt's commitment to carry out the terms
                    of the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty, which was important in itself, but in
                    other respects he seemed wooden, lacking Sadat's forcefulness and charisma. From
                    Cairo I went to Jerusalem to meet with Prime Minister Begin who talked at length
                    about Sadat's funeral. The funeral was on a Saturday and, in order to observe
                    the Sabbath, Begin arrived Friday afternoon. He stayed in what he termed
                    “Egyptian army barracks.” Lowering his eyes and wrinkling his nose, he said they
                    were “filthy.” He then proceeded to recount his walking in the funeral
                    procession and having Sadat's son came up, kiss him on both cheeks and tell him,
                    “I consider you my father.” A week or two later I was talking with President
                    Carter who also attended the funeral. He told me what moved him most was when
                    Sadat's son came up to him, kissed him on both cheeks and told him, “I consider
                    you my father.” How many fathers can one person have?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course at that time we still had sort of the
                        Palestinians with Arafat. They were very difficult.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Indeed they were. Arafat had been kicked out of Jordan. He went to Lebanon
                    where he remained until '82, when the U.S. took him by ship to Tunisia. The
                    issue then as now is whether the Israelis should have stayed in the territories
                    occupied in the Six Day War. Following the war, there was a major debate within
                    the Israeli government. Some wanted to withdraw immediately in return for an end
                    to the conflict. But Arafat and the Arab World could not accept the humiliating
                    defeat of the '67 War. A few months later, in Khartoum, they came up with the
                    three “No's” — No negotiation, No peace, No recognition. That killed it until
                    today. Had the Arabs been willing to negotiate and recognize Israel, the
                    Israelis would have withdrawn in '67.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Lost opportunities, but the Israelis were responsible too, including
                    Sharon. He pushed the settlements. He was the major architect of the settlement
                    policy. The Labor government was much more circumspect. Initially, Labor called
                    for settlements along the Jordan River and in the Jordan Valley, but not
                    elsewhere. Sharon supported the illegal settlements that in time became legal. I
                    think his disengagement plan today for Gaza is the wrong approach. What he
                    should do is dismantle the illegal settlements on the West Bank. Forget about
                    Gaza until there is formal agreement. Israel needs to be a country of law and
                    order. The settlers in Gaza are there legally. The government put them
                    there.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Romanian connection, how did this, I mean were you
                        acting sort of on your own or was there...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: On my own. I first went to Romania as a vice president of the American
                    Jewish Committee, but later I was on my own. I was in Washington; I was an
                    activist, and I started pushing to get Jews out of Romania, individual cases got
                    solved. In this I enlisted the support of the administration. Brzezinski agreed
                    to put Jewish emigration in Carter's talking points for his meeting with
                    Ceausescu in '78. Ceausescu said it was a domestic issue, but Carter wisely
                    replied, “No it isn't; it affects the relationship between our two countries.”
                    Ceausescu was not one to negotiate. He was very difficult.</p>

                <p>MOSES: I met with him three times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: I thought he was vastly overrated. I couldn't understand how he wielded
                    the power he did. He was physically unimpressive, flabby and short. He didn't
                    exert any sense of power or stature. The first time I met him was at the Waldorf
                    Towers. He was wearing a blue serge suit. I guess all communists wore blue serge
                    suits in those days. I met him again in Predeal, Romania in January 1980, a
                    two-hour meeting. I still have my notes of the meeting. He just harangued; he
                    was incapable of saying anything profound. He thought he was far more important
                    than he was. He took credit for the Sadat/Begin meeting which neither Begin nor
                    Sadat thought he deserved. Sadat did ask Ceausescu if Begin was reliable and did
                    he have the strength to be effective. Ceausescu answered affirmatively. Whether
                    that influenced his later decision to go to Jerusalem, I doubt. Sadat indicated
                    to me it did not. I think Ceausescu's intervention was of no real
                    importance.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the 70's when you got involved, what was as you saw it
                        the plight of the Romanian Jews?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Jews in Romania had been tossed out of everything. Originally there was
                    some Jewish, very prominent Jewish involvement in the communist movement in
                    Central and Eastern Europe. But after the Slansky trial, in '52 in Prague, Jews
                    were systematically thrown out of governments in Central and Eastern Europe.
                    Stalin was an anti-Semite. He had liquidated the Jewish leaders Trotsky,
                    Zinoviev and others. Molotov was married to a Jewish woman. Stalin used to
                    needle Molotov about his Jewish wife. Kaganovich survived, I don't know how.
                    After the “doctor's trial” in '49 in Leningrad, Stalin turned on the Jews. What
                    happened was that “national communism” took over and nationalists in the region
                    were historically anti-Semitic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this reflect directly on Romania? I mean was the
                        communist movement, the Romanians had a reputation as being anti Semitic
                        stemming from WWII.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: The Iron Guard was virulently anti-Semitic. Later 150,000 Romanian Jews in
                    Transnistra were murdered in '41 and '42 under Antonescu. We can go into that if
                    you wish. But later these communist despots, once ideology went by the wayside,
                    fell back on nativism to buttress their regimes. Ceausescu was typical. In ways
                    obvious and not so obvious, he encouraged anti-Semitism or certainly let loose
                    forces of anti-Semitism. Jews who had had prominent government positions were
                    thrown out, starting with Ana Pauker. This was before Ceausescu was in power. So
                    by the time I got there in '76, Jews who had been in government were unemployed.
                    Some had been falsely charged with crimes. One man I met, who had been in the
                    foreign service, was accused of padding his expense account, and he probably
                    did. Everybody did because the official allowance was not sufficient to eat or
                    get a hotel room. This was well known. But this man went to prison. I later
                    helped get him out of the country. Conditions were very difficult.</p>

                <p>MOSES: The original MFN legislation was in '75 before I became active. I didn't
                    pick up on it until '76-'77. I had nothing to do with the original MFN
                    legislation granting Romania most favored nation treaty status on a year-to-year

                <p>MOSES: Romania did not get MFN until '75 or '76. This was during the Ford

                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Romania sold its Jews to Israel for $2,000 a head, but I did not know this
                    until after Ceausescu fell. They were selling their Germans for $2,000 or $2,500
                    a head. Chancellor Kohl greatly resented the Romanian hold-up. Even after
                    Ceausescu was gone, he strongly distrusted Romania.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>MOSES: I never defended the Ceausescu regime. The one time I testified on the
                    Hill I said that the situation in Romania was “horrible,” my exact words. Unlike
                    others, I never said anything positive about Ceausescu. What I said was that
                    under the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, which was the legislation in issue, Romania's
                    Jews had the right to emigrate, and therefore, however deplorable the situation
                    in Romania, MFN was the one lever we had to get Jews, and others, out. We were
                    able to do precisely this. I helped a Christian minister get out of Romania. He
                    now has a church in Northern Virginia. I helped another minister who had been
                    put in jail for distributing Bibles. I was also able to get the official Baptist
                    translation of the Bible printed in Romania. I could not have done this without
                    MFN. In retrospect, was it the right policy? I don't know. Successive
                    administrations, including the Reagan Administration, supported what I was doing
                    largely because they saw Ceausescu as someone independent from the Soviet Union.
                    Romania was not a member of the Warsaw Military Pact. The United States may also
                    have been getting some intelligence from the Romanians, but if we did, it was
                    probably not worth a damn.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the issue about Romanian Jews going to Israel because

                </p>
                <p>MOSES: That wasn't true of Romania's Jews. They chiefly headed for Israel. From
                    the Soviet Union they went to Austria, and then to Italy, where about half went
                    to the United States and half to Israel. That was not true of Romanian Jewry.

                <p>MOSES: In Israel? Romanian Jews are very prominent in Israel. At one point it was
                    probably the second largest ethnic community. About 400,000 Romanian Jews ended
                    up in Israel. There was a larger emigration from Morocco in the 50's. Later
                    Russian Jews came in even larger numbers. Many people in prominent positions in
                    Israel were born in Romania. Two former ambassadors here, Meir Rosenne and Moshe
                    Arad, were born in Romania. Mendy Meron, a former Israeli military attach� here,
                    was born in Romania. There are scores of Israelis of prominence born in Romania.
                    Romanian Jews have not been disadvantaged. They have been quite successful.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOSES: About half the Jews lived in Bucharest, the other half outside the
                    capital. The numbers going to Israel were proportionate to where the Jews
                    lived.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOSES: That's harder to say. Most Romanian Jews by the mid 70's were well
                    educated, because the Romanian populace as a whole was well educated.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>MOSES: No, to the contrary. We are talking about people who were either
                    tradesmen, business people or professional people. A lot of engineers, some
                    lawyers, some doctors. Romanians under the communists were well educated, less
                    so before the communists took over. Jews traditionally were much better educated
                    than the general public.</p>

                <p>MOSES: No, but there were Jewish neighborhoods in Bucharest, and Jews were overly
                    represented in proportion to their numbers in the professions, medicine,
                    law.</p>

                <p>MOSES: Well the worst ones were shtetls. I visited some of them. But by the mid
                    70's they were pretty well gone. The Jews had been urbanized. That wasn't true
                    in the years before. It was true by the time I got there. The Jewish shtetls
                    that I visited were Dorohoi and a few others. It was just a remnant of the
                    Jewish community of yesteryear.</p>

                        You mentioned the Germans and Kohl. What about the Hungarians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Not before I was ambassador. When I was ambassador I did a lot with the
                    Hungarian community. Before that, I didn't even know the Hungarian community
                    except for a few members of the Congress such as Congressman Schultz from
                    Pennsylvania who was quite active on behalf of ethnic Hungarians in Romania.
                    Schultz was a member of a CODEL to Romania in 1980. I was there. The CODEL went
                    right from the plane to the chief rabbi's office. First they asked the rabbi
                    about discrimination against Hungarians. The rabbi said, “I am only a rabbi.
                    That is not something I can respond to, but if you asked me personally, I don't
                    think there is discrimination.” He was Romanian; he had come from Moldavia and
                    probably shared the general Romanian feeling about ethnic Hungarians.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOSES: This is Moldavia which is one of the original two Romanian principalities,
                    Wallachia and Moldavia. Many Jews lived in Moldavia. Former Chief Rabbi Moses
                    Rosen was from Moldavia. But this is not to be confused with Moldova, the
                    present Republic of Moldova. Its capital is Chisinau.</p>

                    and left the White House on Inauguration Day, January 20, 1981.</p>
                <p>

                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>MOSES: I succeeded my friend Ed Sanders. He had the title of Senior Advisor to
                    the President with an office in the State Department on the seventh floor, and
                    originally in the East Wing of the White House. He had come a year or two before
                    but then returned to California because of his wife's health. He originally
                    proposed to remain, working part time, but Hamilton Jordan, Carter's Chief of
                    Staff, nixed this. Sol Linowitz, Carter's special emissary for the Panama Canal
                    Treaty, along with Stu Eizenstat and Lloyd Cutler, White House Counsel, met to
                    decide on Ed's successor. I was told one of them said they needed someone like
                    Al Moses whereupon someone else said, “Why don't we call Al.” Ed did call me. I
                    went over, was interviewed, and got the job. Once on the job, I quickly
                    discovered the office was a mess. Ed left no records to speak of, and his staff
                    was a hodgepodge of cast-offs from other White House offices with no particular
                    knowledge or experience in Jewish affairs, including Israel. The one exception
                    was Marvin Feuerwerger, who had been Ed's principal assistant and who today
                    holds a high position in AIPAC. A short time after I arrived at the White House,
                    Ham Jordan called me to his office. Ham was usually light and breezy, but not
                    this time. He had a deep scowl on his face and, after seating me in a chair
                    opposite his desk, proceeded to tell me in solemn tones that, as I undoubtedly
                    knew, Marvin was the subject of a security investigation. This came as a bolt
                    out of the blue. (Ed Sanders knew about this before he left the White House but
                    did not tell me. This was consistent with his not telling me generally about his
                    staff or work. He consistently brushed off my questions, saying I knew all I
                    needed to know, a vast overstatement.) Returning to Marvin, Jordan recounted a
                    bizarre tale involving Hal Saunders, the Assistant Secretary of State for Near
                    Eastern Affairs, and a friend of mine. The supposed security breach involved
                    talking points for Bob Strauss, the President's Special Envoy to the Middle
                    East, on a visit to Israel some months previously. The talking points had been
                    leaked in advance to Wolf Blitzer, later CNN's Chief Diplomatic Correspondent.
                    Marvin and Wolf were long-time friends and, according to Ham, on this basis Hal
                    fingered Marvin as the probable source of the leak. When I met with Marvin, he
                    denied this, but it was too late. Marvin was gone from the White House, landing
                    a job at the Pentagon with his security clearance fully intact, as it should
                    have been. Many months later Wolf Blitzer told me that the source of the leak
                    was none other than Hal Saunders. This was my first, but not last, exposure to
                    hardball Washington-style. Hal had apparently fingered Marvin to save himself.
                    In other respects Hal was helpful to me. He went out of his way to include me in
                    high-level discussions on Middle East issues including visits to Washington by
                    Israeli and Arab leaders. By way of contrast, Sol Linowitz, who had persuaded
                    President Carter and others to bring me to the White House, was anything but
                    friendly. I never figured out whether it was territorial on Sol's part in not
                    wanting another Jew involved in the Peace Process or whether it was just the way
                    he went about his business. The greatest favor Hal Saunders did for me was to
                    send Marc Grossman from State to be my assistant at the White House. Marc was
                    then a junior foreign service officer but was already stamped by Hal and others
                    at State for success. He lived up to his billings. He went on to become
                    Executive Secretary at State, U.S. ambassador to Turkey, Assistant Secretary of
                    State for European Affairs, Director General of the Foreign Service and Under
                    Secretary of State for Political Affairs, the highest career position in the
                    department. Marc and I quickly became close personal friends and have remained
                    so. He educated me on the ways of the State Department that would stand me in
                    good stead when I became ambassador to Romania. He became ambassador to Turkey
                    at the same time. We were classmates in the State Department's three-week course
                    for new ambassadors. I needed the education much more than Marc. Two other
                    assistants eventually joined Marc and me. One was Mark Ginsberg who in the 1990s
                    was the U.S. ambassador to Morocco; the other was Ralph Grunewald who is now
                    serving as the Executive Vice President of Hillel. They both brought to the
                    White House genuine enthusiasm and deep knowledge of the Jewish community. Over
                    the ensuing months we also attracted a number of young volunteers, one of whom
                    was Debbie White who was just starting college. She later earned a Ph.D. from
                    Columbia University and is now teaching. Another intern, Evan Bloom, was
                    acknowledged by all to be brilliant. He became a lawyer, joined the
                    distinguished Washington law firm of Arnold &amp; Porter and is now at State.
                    Later when I became Special Counsel to the President in the Billygate Hearings,
                    Zo� Baird came to the counsel's office from Justice. Twelve years later, Zo� was
                    President Clinton's first choice to be Attorney General, but when her
                    confirmation ran into a buzz saw in the Senate over the nanny issue, she
                    withdrew her name.</p>

                    He had been working with his father all those years when Jimmy was in the Navy.
                    When Jimmy returned, Billy stormed out of the office and drove a front-end
                    loader with a full load of peanuts right into a tree. He was so mad that his
                    brother was taking over the family business. This was what Jimmy told me.</p>

                <p>MOSES: Jimmy is a tough fellow. He is bright but also demanding with a very high
                    performance standard and a moral sense of rectitude. None of this went down well
                    with Billy.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOSES: This was after Jimmy became President. Billy capitalized on his newfound
                    fame as the beer-drinking brother of the President. It was a bust.</p>

                <p>MOSES: All those things.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Not helping my client, the President. It certainly didn't help with the
                    Jewish community, and it didn't help with the country at large. Jimmy didn't
                    rein him in. Jimmy would say, “I can't rein the guy in. He won't listen to me. I
                    would say go right; Billy would go left.” It was a mistake for the President to
                    give his brother access to government officials in Washington. He could have
                    said, “Look, Billy, Washington is off limits.” But he loved Billy and wanted to
                    help him. If fact be known, he didn't see anything wrong with Billy's helping
                    Qadhafi. He told me, “Billy earned it. He is good at PR.” He didn't see the red
                    line and didn't see the political damage this would cause.</p>

                <p>MOSES: No, again it was much more complex.</p>
                <p>MOSES: The Israeli ambassador to the United States was Ephraim Evron. He was very
                    clever. He had established a good relationship with Lyndon Johnson years before
                    when he was serving in the Israeli embassy. Eppie worked well with the Carter
                    administration, particularly with Vice President Mondale and Bob Strauss. Truth
                    be known, he brought Shimon Peres, then leader of the opposition, to the White
                    House to meet with Carter. Begin was upset. Eppie was close to the Labor Party,
                    not officially, but in terms of his private preference. A few weeks later I flew
                    with Begin and Eppie to New York. I understand Hebrew. Begin accused Eppie of
                    bringing Peres to meet Carter. Eppie denied it, claiming he had nothing to do
                    with the visit It was all done on the initiative of the White House, he said. I
                    got a lesson on how people deal with heads of government. He was very nimble
                    politically. In the last two days of the campaign, Ezer Weisman who had been
                    Minister of Defense in the first Begin Government and a hero of the Six Days War
                    came to the United States and campaigned for Carter. It didn't do Carter any
                    good. The political right in Israel was strongly pro-Reagan. So, too, were some
                    Jewish intellectuals in this country such as Norman Podhoretz, editor of
                    Commentary, who had previously been a staunch Democrat. Others, Jewish and
                    non-Jewish Commentary contributors, included Jeane Kirkpatrick, Richard Perle,
                    Paul Wolfowitz, Irving Kristol and lots more. The Democrats in Congress were not
                    very enthusiastic about Carter. They saw him as a political liability, not an
                    asset. They were proven right.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know looking back on it, the real problem was Carter,
                        not the other thing. He did not present a strong government. He was in the

                </p>
                <p>MOSES: As President, he was not as effective as he should have been. I tried to
                    change things, to give him a sense of how to project himself politically,
                    exuding confidence and power. He lost this after our embassy staff in Teheran
                    was seized. I spoke with him about core Democratic Party issues, but at heart he
                    was a populist. He attacked lawyers, accountants, professional people generally,
                    exalting the mythical, primordial man, right out of Rousseau. The American
                    public did not want to listen; he was too preachy, too glum. In fact, he was a
                    much better president than George W. Bush, but Bush went around the country in
                    2004 walking and talking as though he were running the world and on top of
                    everything. The American public re-elected him, even though he doesn't have half
                    the candle power that Carter had. Jimmy Carter went around in a mental slouch.
                    He had given his malaise speech in July of '79.</p>

                <p>MOSES: The malaise speech.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The malaise speech which really turned me off.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: It turned everybody off. It was a ridiculous speech. Jody Powell put him
                    up to it. Fritz (Mondale) was incensed by the predictable political suicide. The
                    speech was just dreadful. He wanted to re-energize the country; he thought the
                    country was drifting. This and the hostage-taking killed his presidency. He
                    became the hostage in Teheran but not George W. Bush in Iraq. “No stepping back
                    from terrorists; hit them every chance you can,” is his theme song, and he sold
                    it even though the supposed imminent domestic terrorist attacks were outright
                    lies intended for political purposes to scare the American public and make
                    people believe Bush was protecting American families. Carter had no sense how to
                    portray strength and confidence. If he didn't believe it, he couldn't say it. It
                    just wasn't his style; it wasn't his mindset. Right after Carter was elected in
                    '76, I flew to New York with Ben Rosenthal, a long-time, highly astute
                    congressman from New York. A few days before he had had a long talk with “Little
                    Gene” Talmadge, the senior senator from Georgia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah, Talmadge.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Talmadge told Ben that, as Governor, Carter had ruined Georgia, ruined the
                    Democratic Party in Georgia and, as President, would ruin the Democratic Party
                    nationally. “You will regret the day Jimmy Carter comes to Washington. He is not
                    an effective leader. He didn't accomplish much in Georgia, and he is not going
                    to accomplish much in Washington,” Ben told me. Ben died a few years later.
                    Talmadge's words turned out to be true. Carter also brought his campaign staff
                    to the White House. They were inexperienced in the ways of Washington and, after
                    the first two to three years, were seen for what they were, largely
                    second-rate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find working in that White House, you mentioned
                        Jody Powell who was his chief of staff.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: No, Jody was press secretary. Ham Jordan was chief of staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Press secretary and Ham Jordan, but those two seemed to
                        have rather both fixed ideas. They were renowned for not making the proper

                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>MOSES: That was Jordan. He was arrogant; he was young. He was smart, a good
                    strategist, but basically not up to the task. In 1980, he left to work on the
                    campaign. Bob Strauss needed an assistant and Carter sent Ham. Jack Watson then
                    became chief of staff. Jack was a nice guy but not up to being the President's
                    Chief of Staff. These are all Georgia boys with no prior Washington experience —
                    Jody, Jack and the rest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you have trouble working in the White House, I
                        mean...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: With them?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In other words did you feel like this is an isolated White
                        House?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: I thought it was an isolated White House. I also thought it was a little
                    bit like playing with model airplanes. There was some competence, and certainly
                    toughness. Carter had done some very good things, but I was not impressed with
                    his senior staff. The only two people I thought were in the same league with
                    (pardon my parochialism) Covington partners were Lloyd Cutler, who was certainly
                    preeminent. Speaking frankly, Lloyd had problems as well; he was an
                    extraordinarily able and sophisticated lawyer, but he thought he was
                    commander-in-chief, basically, and could run anything. Regrettably, his
                    competence was not that broad or deep. But he was enormously able. Stu Eizenstat
                    was also highly competent. He had an excellent staff of younger people, and ran
                    a very good operation with sound analyses, well ordered and reliable. Stu's
                    problem was he did not recognize the shift that had taken place in the country.
                    He was still way over on the liberal side. He was way off base when Ham Jordan
                    at a senior staff meeting asked for advice before the aborted Teheran rescue
                    mission. I and only one other staff person spoke up for taking decisive military
                    action. Stu counseled against it on the grounds it would hurt with the liberal
                    wing of the Democratic Party. The liberal wing of the Democratic Party was not
                    what was up for grabs in the election. Stu did not understand this. I and
                    Hendrick Hertzberg, who is now an editor at The New Yorker, spoke otherwise.
                    Rick was Carter's speechwriter. He is a superb writer and, for a few years, was
                    quite prominent in the Clinton Administration. But certainly Stu was competent,
                    more than competent, excellent, and Lloyd was stellar; but the rest of them in
                    my view were not impressive. Jody in his own way was solid and the press liked
                    him. The president had confidence in him, but he, too, could not see over the
                    horizon very well. He is the one who came up with the idea for the malaise
                    speech.</p>

                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>MOSES: Day by day, every day. We were trying to salvage the ship, and the
                    President wanted us to succeed. He understood the importance of the Jewish vote.
                    We did what we could. I brought everyone under the sun to the White House
                    looking for fresh ideas and advice. One such person was Alfred Gottschalk,
                    president of Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati. Fred was by no means a fan of
                    Carter, but he was willing to talk and advise. After an hour or so, he said
                    admiringly, “You are doing all this with smoke and mirrors.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...how this works between, you know lawyers seem to be
                        able to take off and go off and do these things. I mean it has been a
                        practice that has gone on since the republic was founded. But I would think
                        it would cause difficulty.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Well, other people covered for me in my practice. And I was never far
                    away. The day after the November presidential election I argued a case in the
                    Court of Appeals. I even went to South Carolina one day when I was working in
                    the White House to buy a steel business for a client. So long as I did not deal
                    with the Federal Government, there was no conflict. I took a 180-day non-paid
                    position and was not expected to spend more than 80 percent of my time at the
                    White House. The rest of my time I could do what I wanted so long as there was
                    no conflict.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to say you had to be careful not to use the

                <p>MOSES: I never used the White House.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOSES: I never got close to anything like that. If I had anything to do
                    pertaining to my law practice, I would walk across the street to Covington's
                    offices. While serving in the White House, I never interceded on behalf of my
                    clients with anybody in government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well while you were doing this, how did you sense where
                        the State Department was going. I mean you mentioned Pat Derian.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>MOSES: Patricia Derian was Assistant Secretary for Human Rights. I worked
                    primarily with Harold Saunders, the Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern
                    Affairs. Hal cleared a Presidential statement that I drafted that was
                    significant. At the time all of Jerusalem was under Israeli control, as it is
                    today. Under the 1948 Partition Plan, West Jerusalem was to be Israeli; East
                    Jerusalem Palestinian. But in the Six Day War Israeli forces occupied all of
                    Jerusalem. Later Israel annexed all of Jerusalem. I wrote the President's
                    statement, with Hal's blessing, that, “The political status of Jerusalem will
                    not change without the consent of the parties, and that includes Israel.” It
                    meant that basically Israel's annexation can never change without Israel's
                    consent. In other words, the President's statement should have given
                    considerable assurance to the Jewish community. Jerusalem will remain Israeli
                    unless the government of Israel decides otherwise. This was a major statement 27
                    years ago. Today people take it for granted. Sam Lewis, our ambassador, had the
                    confidence of the President. Sam was one of the few people at State who realized
                    in 1977 that Begin was not going to be a short-term prime minister. Others
                    viewed his election as an aberration and thought the Labor Party would be back
                    in power in a year or two. Sam knew otherwise. And he was right. Both Begin and
                    Carter trusted Sam. He was quite effective. It was a tumultuous period. Our own
                    policies were difficult to implement. For example, a U.S. official could not go
                    to East Jerusalem. In '77, Vice President Mondale wanted to visit the Western
                    Wall which under the Partition Plan is officially in East Jerusalem. Max
                    Kampelman who accompanied Mondale on the trip worked it out so that the Vice
                    President entered through the Dung Gate, making it an unofficial visit. So there
                    were all these prohibitions and inconsistencies, most of which were blown away
                    during the Reagan Administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about where stood while you were doing this, the
                        settlement policy or problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Well, it was clear that President Carter thought the settlements were an
                    obstacle to peace. I don't know if State ever said they were illegal, but if it
                    didn't use that exact word, it said something close to it. Before I took the job
                    at the White House, probably a year or two earlier, I gave a speech to the
                    American Jewish Committee's Board of Governors in which I said that the
                    settlement policy, as it was then being implemented, would make the settlements
                    hostage to reaching an accommodation with the Palestinians. I made specific
                    reference to the proposed settlement in Alon Moreh that had Biblical importance
                    but not otherwise. My warning turned out to be correct. The dividing line for me
                    was settlements that had made sense militarily and would enhance Israel's
                    security, not just accommodate settler ambitions.</p>

                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>MOSES: I was opposed to settlements that were authorized in order to change
                    “conditions on the ground.” In other words, put a finger in the Palestinians'
                    eye. Why occupy land that had importance Biblically but had no military
                    importance. If there ever is a peace agreement, these settlements will be on the
                    wrong side of the line. I thought I spoke with vigor and was persuasive. I ended
                    up getting about eight votes out of 100 or so. I remember the one person who
                    spoke out most adamantly opposing me was Rita Hauser, who later became a dove.
                    At the time she was running for lieutenant governor of New York and was trolling
                    for Jewish votes. Apparently, she thought she had to be to the right of Menachem
                    Begin to win. Not having much support, she later withdrew from the race. She
                    then did a 180-degree turn. So much for politics.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about did you get involved in this thing for, God it

                </p>
                <p>MOSES: That's right. Carter did not call for moving the embassy to Jerusalem. I
                    think Reagan was the first President who did. I don't know what George H.W. Bush
                    said in '88. My guess is Dukakis was in favor of moving it. Clinton, I think,
                    also spoke in favor. George W. Bush certainly did in 2000. It has never
                    happened. I consider it irresponsible on their part, just vote-chasing. That
                    said, if I were President, I would move the embassy to Jerusalem. There is no
                    reason in the world why it should not be there. The Government of Israel is
                    there. Of course, the Arabs won't like it, but so be it. I would move the
                    embassy and put it in West Jerusalem. It is the capital of Israel. No one knows
                    what the boundaries of Jerusalem will end up being. If we ever have a final
                    settlement, there will be some official Palestinian presence in Jerusalem. But
                    it may be that Ramallah will become part of Jerusalem. Under the Taba Proposal
                    in late 2000, there would have been an official Palestinian presence in East
                    Jerusalem. There would have been a flag and political presence. This may still
                    be what turns out. But I think for us to keep our embassy in Tel Aviv is a
                    denial of reality. If we were to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, would there
                    be anti-American demonstrations in the Middle East? For sure. But we have had
                    those before. Every presidential candidate says he is going to do it and then
                    doesn't. We are doing business and dealing with the Government of Israel in
                    Jerusalem every day.</p>

                <p>MOSES: It is. The whole business makes no sense. At this point I think we ought

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is 20 June 2005. Mr. Ambassador I think we had
                        skipped some things during the Carter administration that we might go back
                        to. This may be a duplication. So let's talk about some of the things that
                        you got involved in. You mentioned for example, the Andy Young business at
                        the United Nations. Do you want to talk about it from your perspective.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>MOSES: Sure. Andy Young was our Permanent Representative (ambassador) to the
                    United Nations. As such, he was a member of the President's cabinet. He was also
                    a friend of Jimmy's. He was from Georgia and had been a very prominent
                    congressman. He was photogenic and a compelling speaker, but a bit of a rebel.
                    He liked to shock, but he also could fit in as a member of the establishment. He
                    was a major name in the United States at the time. His nomination to the United
                    Nations position was a popular appointment by Carter, although, as it turned
                    out, it ended Young's political career. What happened is that he met with Yasser
                    Arafat in the UN, and that was contrary to official U.S. policy. He did this on
                    his own. I think he had the sense that he was above it all, and that he could
                    charm anyone, including Yasser Arafat. He is not the only public official who
                    thought that Arafat could be tamed or changed, neither of which ever occurred.
                    When the word about Andy's meeting with Arafat leaked out, Andy had to resign.
                    No doubt there was pressure from the White House. I do not know if Carter,
                    himself, insisted on Andy's resignation. That was not Carter's way. In fact,
                    Carter had a lot of the same sympathies Andy Young had for the Palestinian
                    cause. When Young left, Don McHenry, who I believe had been his deputy, took
                    over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes he was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Don was also African American. He had the same views as Andy. He was not
                    colorful or charismatic nor as eloquent a speaker, but he was quite determined.
                    He voted on a Security Council resolution pertaining to the status of Jerusalem
                    that Cy Vance had shown in advance to the President who approved the language
                    without focusing on it. All hell broke loose the day after the vote. Mondale in
                    particular was upset. The President issued an official “mea culpa,” in effect
                    reversing the U.S. vote, but the damage was done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was Walter Mondale.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Yes. I was not yet in the White House. The vote preceded my going to the
                    White House. Walter Mondale saw the Jewish community as a political ally. The
                    Jews, Afro-Americans, labor, minorities generally, were the backbone of the
                    Democratic Party's support in this country. Fritz was particularly upset with
                    what he considered to have been bungling on the part of the Administration, and
                    the President's failure to be sensitive to trigger issues. Carter himself was
                    quite conflicted. When he ran for President in '76, he was careful to limit his
                    support for Israel to protecting its security. He had also endorsed the
                    Brookings Report that was published a few months before the election.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well we can add this.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>MOSES: Bill was later the President's Special Advisor and Senior Director for
                    Middle East issues on the National Security staff. By the time I got to the
                    White House, Bill was gone. He was replaced by Bob Hunter, who, under President
                    Clinton, was our ambassador to NATO. Carter, himself, no doubt shared the views
                    of Don McHenry and Andy Young. For political reasons and because this was
                    post-Camp David, indeed, post-signing of the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty, he
                    had made commitments that did not allow him the latitude that Young exercised
                    and McHenry certainly thought. This may have contributed to Carter's blindness
                    when he approved the text Vance showed him. It caused political turmoil and
                    probably was a major factor in Carter's getting such a low percentage of the
                    Jewish vote. He got 46%, which, had that been the plurality in the election,
                    Carter would have won the election. John Anderson got 14% of the Jewish vote,
                    Reagan 38%, which was high for a Republican candidate. Carter was seriously
                    damaged by what had happened at the United Nations. He seemed incapable of
                    extricating himself from a whole series of anti-Israel resolutions in the
                    Security Council. We later managed to do this for him. Bob Hunter and I worked
                    with Max Kampelman who, at my invitation, came to the White House to confer with
                    Bob and me. Fritz Mondale, too, was very supportive. In fact, it was he who
                    suggested we involve Max. This was after a series of U.S. abstentions on
                    anti-Israel Security Council resolutions introduced monthly by Arab countries.
                    We managed to get Secretary of State Ed Muskie to take a day off from his summer
                    vacation in Maine to give a speech at the UN putting an end to the monthly
                    Arab-sponsored anti-Israel resolutions. The President was not directly involved
                    in our plotting. Don McHenry was furious. He came to the White House to complain
                    about the “Jewish cabal.” Of course, I was the only Jew. The other persons in
                    the room were Bob Hunter, David Aaron, who was maybe half Jewish, and one or two
                    others. I seem to recall that Dick Holbrooke showed up for some reason. He was
                    Assistant Secretary for Asian Affairs. Dick's parents were Jewish, but he had no
                    Jewish religious education and no real Jewish feelings. His parents were
                    intellectuals. I think his father was a physician, his mother an artist. They
                    rejected the whole notion of Jewish separateness. Dick was brought up without
                    Jewish consciousness. But he was present at the meeting which was in the
                    Situation Room at the White House. Somehow we got through this difficult period.
                    I wrote a briefing book for the President to use in the campaign. It was long,
                    detailed, and, I think, essentially right. I worked very closely with the
                    President bringing Jewish influentials to the White House. We had three sessions
                    in the Roosevelt Room on each occasion with 20 or so Jewish leaders. The
                    President seemed to enjoy the meetings and thought they were worthwhile. But he
                    never caught fire in the Jewish community. Too many negatives had occurred. His
                    off-the-cuff remarks, one at a press conference in Kansas where he talked about
                    the need to deal directly with the PLO, maybe he said the Palestinians, hurt
                    him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anybody looking at this thing and saying OK,
                        politically this is dynamite, but if you are going to get anywhere, if you
                        don't deal with somebody you are closing a significant door toward bringing
                        peace, or was this an issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>MOSES: It may have been an issue. If it was, it was not discussed with me. I did
                    not sit in NSC meetings. I was not a confidante of the President in the April,
                    May, June time period. I became close to President Carter once Billygate erupted
                    in late July. From then on I worked very closely with him right through the
                    election. A day after the election we had a senior staff meeting that he chaired
                    in the Cabinet Room. He went out of his way to say nice things about me. We had
                    our picture taken together under the portrait of George Washington. He then
                    inscribed it to me. I remember him saying, “You have done a fine job. Jimmy.”
                    That was because of Billygate and my efforts during the campaign. Rosalynn was
                    equally appreciative. She was there with him every step of the way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now we did talk about Billygate but we haven't...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: This was a tense period. I believe I mentioned previously I tried to give
                    him a different direction in the campaign, which he didn't pursue. He gave one
                    speech using these themes. It was a talk at B'nai B'rith where he used the
                    refrain line, “We are on the right road to the right future and we will stay the
                    course.” Rich Hendrickson and I wrote the speech. The quotes were my lines. It
                    went over very well, but he did not pick up on it. He remained wedded to his
                    populist, anti-establishment, trust-me rhetoric.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that Ronald Reagan with his Hollywood
                        background having dealt very closely as an actor and as Screen Actor's Guild
                        with the Jewish community which has always been very strong. Ronald Reagan
                        had close ties to this organization. Was that playing much of a role?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>MOSES: I don't think so. I truly don't. Reagan was seen as a right wing
                    Republican which is not where the Jewish heart and soul is. That is why 14% of
                    the Jewish vote went to Anderson. It was just a negative feeling about Carter.
                    His body language was wrong. Billy Carter was seen as a “redneck,' probably an
                    anti-Semite, whether he was or not. (Jimmy always said he wasn't.) Carter's own
                    south Georgia provincialism just didn't travel well in the Jewish community. I
                    was alone with Carter in the Oval Office for a goodly amount of time two
                    Saturdays after the election. He said to me, “Oh sure we got 46% of the Jewish
                    vote, but we expected to do much better, wanted to do much better.” He believed
                    he deserved to do much better. I remember his saying that after the
                    Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty he didn't expect to lose Jewish support. He was
                    down in spirit. It was no fun to lose the election. And he lost it. I don't
                    think Reagan won it. People now refer to the debate in Cleveland before the
                    election. Carter's popularity went down a few points after the debate, but it
                    came back a week later when the polls showed he was a point or so ahead. What
                    did him in was his inability to resolve the hostage crisis. He made an enormous
                    mistake returning to the White House, in effect canceling the campaign, the
                    Sunday before the election. He had hoped to announce the hostages' release that
                    Sunday. When nothing happened, it was seen as further ineptness on his part. The
                    Iranian Government was toying with Carter — raising his hopes and then dashing
                    them. He became, in effect, the real hostage. Indeed, I was with him at the
                    White House the night before the Reagan inauguration. Carter, Warren
                    Christopher, Deputy Secretary of State, and Lloyd Cutler, Counsel to the
                    President, left the party around eight to work on the hostage crisis. The next
                    day the hostages were released because they were no longer of use to the
                    Iranians. They had already served Iran's purpose.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you picking up any emanations that Casey or somebody
                        was making deals with the Iranians?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>MOSES: I don't think so. Anything is possible, but I had no knowledge of it. I
                    did think that Carter had, inadvertently, made himself a hostage. I tried to
                    tell him that by going for the bait (the Iranians' dangling the prospect of
                    release of the hostages), he had put himself under arrest in the U.S. embassy.
                    He did not understand the political damage to him. He didn't start to campaign
                    until April. That was five months after the take-over of the American Embassy in
                    Tehran. Instead of thumbing his nose at the Iranians, he appeared as a beggar or
                    supplicant. He should have tightened the screws on the Iranians as he did on the
                    Soviet Union when it invaded Afghanistan (for which he didn't get sufficient
                    credit). He should have said to the Iranians, “Don't call until you release the
                    hostages.” The political impressions were that he was ineffective, weak,
                    vacillating — in a word, didn't know how to play it. Reagan was very good at
                    “playing it” and deserves credit for bringing a sense of leadership to the
                    country. In my view, on substance he was dreadful. On substance Carter was
                    better. He did good things once he got to the White House, but he had no sales
                    skills. It was all right when he was running for office, talking about reducing
                    government, bringing people into the White House, a new message, a rejection of
                    Watergate, the whole Nixon legacy, but once he got to Washington, his policies
                    appeared thin and after two years or so, he ran out of juice.</p>

                <p>MOSES: They were tone deaf. You had Jody Powell who was press secretary. Jody was
                    good, a smart guy, probably the best of the group. You had Hamilton Jordan who I
                    found to be arrogant, sometimes belligerent, and didn't really know much about
                    building support for the Administration. The Carter team thought he was a
                    political genius, because he had done a good concept paper that helped in the
                    1976 election. But once he came to Washington, he did not make the transition.
                    He came as a rebel, thumbing his nose at Washington, looking sophomoric.</p>

                <p>MOSES: There was also Jack Watkins, mediocre in talent and ability, but a decent
                    guy. The best of the group from Georgia was Stu Eizenstat who ran domestic
                    policy. Stu was extremely methodical and had a superb staff but sometimes went
                    the wrong way on issues. He was opposed to using military force of any kind in
                    Iran. He was afraid Carter would lose the liberal wing of the Democratic party
                    and Teddy Kennedy would get the nomination. He didn't, in my view, understand
                    that the American people wanted a leader as President. Stu was a superb
                    processor and had a good head for issues. He understood and appreciated the
                    importance of getting along with the Congress, something Carter never adequately
                    faced up to. His congressional relations people were a weak link in the White
                    House. The President and the Congress were at dagger points by the end of
                    Carter's presidency. Carter thought that he could reach out directly to the
                    American people, could go beyond the institutions of government, go beyond
                    structures in the private sector as well, and appeal to the public on the basis
                    of populism. Once he became president, that was no longer an effective way of
                    communicating. There were a lot of Georgia boys in less important positions in
                    the White House. They were generally hostile and not helpful on issues. They
                    were loyal to Jimmy and he probably was loyal to them, but they didn't bring
                    much. They had no world vision. They didn't know how to get things done.
                    Carter's staff, on a one to ten, was somewhere around a three to a four in terms
                    of effectiveness and ability. Except for Eizenstat and, later, Lloyd Cutler, the
                    staff was not up to the job. But Lloyd had his own baggage. He thought he knew
                    more than anybody else. He probably did, but he didn't work cooperatively. He
                    got a lot of face time with the President. In actuality, the President resented
                    Lloyd's pushing all the time, getting into areas that were beyond his competence
                    and his job. He was a wonderful lawyer but made occasional mistakes. On the
                    Billygate matter he had met with Billy. He responded to overtures from Carter to
                    get the Billy issues resolved and didn't see the train wreck down the track. He
                    was more a rain-maker, pontificator, smart but in the end did not serve the
                    President particularly well. Also, the President had problems at State. Cy Vance
                    and the President didn't see things the same. In the end Vance got chewed up by
                    Brzezinski. At Defense he had Harold Brown and Bill Perry, both of whom were
                    outstanding.</p>

                <p>MOSES: Well, Zbig is a friend of mine. He and I became good friends after we left
                    the White House. Zbig is one of a kind. I thought his policy positions were half
                    baked, too quickly formulated. He is a terrific wordsmith. He can put words on
                    paper faster than anyone I have ever known. In those days, the public perception
                    of Brzezinski was almost totally negative. In the White House there were two
                    factions: Zbig who was the hard-liner. Then you had Cy Vance who was more of an
                    accommodationist, much more willing to search for areas of agreement than Zbig.
                    You had David Aaron who had previously been on Mondale's staff in the Senate who
                    was not a Zbig hawk. Unfortunately, Zbig got his picture taken pointing a rifle
                    in the Khyber Pass at an imagined enemy (i.e., Soviet troops). Played up in the
                    press, this looked dreadful. When crises occurred, I don't think Zbig was the
                    right go-to person. When the hostages were taken by the Iranian “students,” Zbig
                    jumped at Rosalynn Carter's idea to use Billy Carter as the go-between with the
                    Libyans. The Sunday after the hostages were taken, Rosalynn was coming down the
                    stairs from the private quarters in the White House, saw Zbig and suggested,
                    “Maybe Billy's Libyan friends can help.” Instead of saying, “Hey, that's a great
                    idea,” and then conveniently forgetting about it, Zbig immediately got hold of
                    Billy. Zbig just responded to what the President wanted. This started the crazy
                    notion of using Billy Carter as an intermediary with the Libyans that later
                    boomeranged and came close to destroying the President.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a period where Carter and everybody else was
                        pushing every button they could to figure out how to get...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Absolutely. Without thinking, they just went in every direction at once.
                    But it was Rosalynn who thought about using Billy and his contacts with the
                    Libyans, even though the Libyans had proven to be totally irresponsible. Qadhafi
                    was so nuts we pulled our ambassador out of Tripoli. There were these half baked
                    ideas, and no one in the White House to say, “Hey, wait a minute, this doesn't
                    make sense.” You need people like that. There were no senior advisors with real
                    experience that were willing to speak up. I had no hesitation speaking up,
                    writing things that were different from what the President had been saying,
                    taking ideas to the President that others were afraid to raise, but I was at a
                    lower level and didn't arrive on the job until it was too late. Most of the
                    staff did not challenge the President. Occasionally, Jody would raise a general
                    staff view with the President, but the others were afraid. As I mentioned
                    earlier, the staff at the White House was weak. The great accomplishment at Camp
                    David came about because of the President's perseverance and tenacity, and the
                    very good staff work of Hal Saunders and others at State. Saunders was the
                    principal drafter of the Camp David Accords. Carter deserves a great deal of
                    credit. He could well have gotten the Nobel Peace Prize in addition to Sadat and
                    Begin; he was the person who made it happen. In a larger sense the genius was
                    Anwar Sadat in terms of bringing it about, but he did not work on the details.
                    That was Saunders, but the parameters were set by Sadat.</p>

                <p>MOSES: When the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty was signed, at first the Jewish
                    community was ecstatic, but then the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty did not help
                    with the Palestinian issue. The Camp David Accords called on Israel to recognize
                    “the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people,” one of those purposely vague
                    diplomatic phrases that meant one thing to Begin, another to Sadat and a third
                    thing to the Palestinians. Talks between Israel and the Palestinians moved at a
                    snail's pace. First Bob Strauss, then Sol Linowitz conducted the talks as the
                    President's representative. There were thirty-some issues on the table. Things
                    just didn't move. Strauss at the direction of the State Department convinced the
                    two sides (plus Egypt) to break into working groups. They then began to tackle
                    the issues more specifically. Sol took over from Strauss when the President
                    brought Bob back to Washington to head the campaign. Sol was much more
                    systematic. He could look at the details, think things through and work toward a
                    solution. Bob Strauss was a big issue guy. He wasn't one to read briefs or write
                    reports. He was more of what you would call a talking head, not without a streak
                    of genius, but relying more on instinct and hoping for the best. He had good
                    political insights, was a great fund-raiser, a good people person, and a lovely
                    guy, a really genuine person. Sol was much more calculating, he played his cards
                    much closer to his chest. He had two able assistants: Andy Marks who practices
                    law in Washington, and Ned Walker, now an ambassador. Sol proceeded in a very
                    professional way and made some progress. But then Carter lost the elections so
                    the process came to a halt. In a word, shortly after the Egyptian-Israeli Peace
                    Treaty was signed, the Jewish community began to lose confidence in Carter.
                    Carter in his heart-of-hearts was closer to the Palestinian perspective than the
                    Israeli. At the same time, on domestic issues he seemed to be waffling on
                    matters that were important to the Jewish community. He wasn't seen as a strong
                    leader who understood, or could empathize with, Jewish concerns. He was seen as
                    a President who said the right things, almost against his will because he had to
                    politically, but his heart wasn't in it.</p>

                <p>MOSES: Not much. Carter threw in the towel on election day. Late in the afternoon
                    the entire senior staff was called to the White House for an announcement that
                    meant he was conceding the election to Governor Reagan although the polls had
                    not yet closed in California. Jesse Jackson was with him which again gave the
                    wrong message. Jesse was perceived to be anti-Israel and anti-Semitic. He had
                    earlier referred to New York as Hymie Town. A day or two after the election
                    Carter met with his senior staff in the Cabinet Room. Brzezinski gave a very
                    sycophantic talk, claiming that the Administration had been consistently right
                    on the issues, and that history would confirm this. I did not believe it. After
                    that it was largely the doldrums; not much happened. Lloyd Cutler went back to
                    his law firm, and other Carter people started looking around for jobs. I think I
                    talked earlier about going to see Carter in the Oval Office on a Saturday
                    afternoon ten days after the election. I was concerned that Carter would sell
                    AWACs to the Saudis. I was trying to protect Mondale. Carter received me warmly.
                    There were just the two of us in the Oval Office. He was tie-less, sitting at
                    his desk wearing a sweater. I sat across from him. We talked about the election,
                    his disappointment at the results. He asked what went wrong with the Jewish
                    vote. I did not hold back. I told him Billy had hurt, as did the vote in the UN
                    Security Council on Jerusalem, broader doubts in the Jewish community about
                    where he stood. We then turned to the AWAC sale. He brushed off my comment about
                    Mondale in 1984 saying he was going to do what was right to protect Saudi
                    Arabia. There was no doubt in my mind that he intended to authorize the AWAC
                    sale. I explained to him that his approving the sale after the election would be
                    seen as gratuitous on his part. Why not kick it over to the Reagan
                    Administration? Further, if he approved the sale now, it would look as though he
                    had intended to do it all along but waited until after the election in order not
                    to lose the Jewish vote. As it turned out, the Reagan Administration asked him
                    to hold off the sale, which he did. Then the Reagan Administration supported it.
                    The Saudis got the AWACs. Four years later, Fritz got about 70% of the Jewish
                    vote, which was much better than Carter had done in '76 or '80, but there was no
                    third party candidate as there had been in 1980. The Jewish vote for Reagan went
                    down from 38% to 30%. In the waning days of the Carter Administration, I was
                    winding up the Billygate hearings with the Justice Department. I also
                    represented members of the White House staff in various investigations. I was
                    the only trial lawyer on staff. I also did what I could to help people on my
                    staff get jobs. Two of them became ambassadors: Marc Grossman and Mark Ginsburg.
                    In the end, I had very good people working with me. Zo� Baird helped with the
                    Billygate hearings. It was wind-down time and a rather sad time. Carter remained
                    aloof. He did everything correctly in terms of sending notes to his staff and
                    pictures. We had dinner in the East Wing of the White House before Christmas
                    which I found sad, but Carter performed well, reading from Dickens. He was very
                    clever in his presentation. He was a man of enormous ability, intelligence and
                    dedication. But like the rest of us he had his idiosyncrasies, most of which
                    were known to the public and are now largely forgotten. He was a good public
                    servant. Certainly, his heart was in the right place and he tried to carry out
                    the job honestly. He had a distaste for politics per se. And as President you
                    have to be not only a good leader, dedicated to the best interests of the
                    country, but also a good politician. His failure was his inability to work with
                    the other institutions of government, primarily Congress, and to understand that
                    once he got to the White House, the public wanted a leader, not a preacher.</p>

                <p>MOSES: I went back to Covington &amp; Burling. In a sense, I had never left. I
                    had been a Special Government Employee. My Covington pay was reduced and I spent
                    90% of my time at the White House, but I was still a Covington partner. And I
                    confess I felt a bit at a loss being back in private practice after the
                    intensity of the White House. Fortunately, my clients had not left, so I picked
                    up where I had left off. I remained fairly close to the President. I would call
                    him occasionally. If he was not there to take the call, he would promptly call
                    back. I remember on one occasion he said, “How are you doing?” I said, “Fine,
                    Mr. President, but to tell the truth, I would rather be in the White House.” He
                    said, “I would too.” That was pretty good. He asked me if I had Lloyd under
                    control. I think he always thought Lloyd and I were in the same law firm or all
                    lawyers in Washington were in one law firm.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Oh, exactly. I continued to try to get Jews out of Romania. I went to
                    Romania many times after 1980.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what were you finding in Romania? Was there a change
                        in attitude or how well Ceausescu...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Ceausescu went from bad to worse.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you seeing this go down, down, down?</hi>

                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>MOSES: I suppose so but, again, I wasn't living in Romania as a Romanian, so I
                    wasn't personally suffering. I think the economic situation in the early 1980s
                    was more or less constant. It wasn't as desperate as it became in the last years
                    of the Ceausescu regime. Also, the oppression became ever greater as the years
                    went by. Ceausescu became more megalomaniac. I was in Romania in December 1984
                    and again the following year for the Chief Rabbi's Hanukkah tours. I took two of
                    my daughters with me, one of whom, Amalie, stayed for three or four weeks after
                    I left to take pictures of the Jewish community in Romania. I went several times
                    for a client to buy steel. On each occasion I would visit with the U.S.
                    ambassador. In 1981 it was Dave Funderburk. I may have mentioned Dave was
                    proposed by Senator Jesse Helms. He was a Helms prot�g�e from North
                    Carolina.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was Funderburk?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>MOSES: Funderburk. He had a rocky career. He later wrote a book entitled Pinks
                    and Pinstripes, or something like that. It was a nutty book. There was one
                    critical sentence about me, but he didn't explain why he was critical. He was
                    truly a loony guy. He did all kinds of things that put him in bad odor. One
                    example: Vice President and Mrs. Bush visited for a day while Dave was
                    ambassador. Ceausescu didn't see them for dinner until 10:00 or so. While
                    waiting for Ceausescu, Funderburk fell asleep and didn't show up for dinner.
                    President Bush later told me Funderburk was about as bad an ambassador as he
                    could imagine. He gambled with Marines, drank a lot, and used to show
                    pornographic movies at the residence. He was a disgrace. Even though he
                    supported annual renewals of MFN (most favored nation tariff status) for
                    Romania, when he was no longer ambassador, he testified in Congress against MFN
                    for Romania. He was a chameleon, no principles, not a very bright guy and way
                    over his head. He had certain basic prejudices. He was also reported to be
                    anti-Semitic, or so I was told by the Israeli ambassador to Romania. No doubt
                    that was true. A pathetic fellow. I think Helms later got a job for him working
                    for the tobacco lobby. He was involved in a traffic accident “driving under the
                    influence.” He left the scene, and came back with his wife behind the wheel. She
                    was a pathetic, much abused lady. She herself had gotten into trouble in Romania
                    according to Reuters. That was a sad period, but I did use Dave, without his
                    knowledge or even awareness, to help Cornelia Bogdan, a former Romanian
                    ambassador to the United States who was back in Romania and had fallen out of
                    grace with Ceausescu. I invited him to lunch with me in Bucharest in the
                    Presidential Suite on the top floor of the Intercontinental Hotel which my
                    client had reserved. I remember we had a sumptuous steak lunch, something out of
                    the ordinary during Ceausescu's rule. I invited Funderburk to give Bogdan cover
                    so that the Securitate (Romanian secret police) would know that Funderburk had
                    met Bogdan. This gave Bogdan some protection. I don't think Funderburk knew what
                    it was all about. It was all just a mystery to him. He probably saw Bogdan as
                    just another Romanian communist, which he had been and still was, but had fallen
                    out with Ceausescu, and at that point was in jeopardy of going to jail. During
                    this period, I also traveled to Egypt. I met with President Mubarak two weeks
                    after Anwar Sadat was assassinated. A few days later I met with Begin in
                    Jerusalem. I also spent time in Germany where I became particularly close to
                    Klaus Kinkel, the German Foreign Minister. I continued to be active on the
                    foreign policy scene. I worked very closely with Roz Ridgeway who was our
                    Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs. Roz was marvelous, as was
                    George Schultz. At my urging the two of them saved the Great Synagogue in
                    Bucharest. I received a telephone call from Ely Rubinstein, now a Justice on the
                    Israeli Supreme Court, but then the Charg� in the Israeli Embassy in Washington.
                    (Meir Rosenne, the ambassador, was in the hospital recovering from a heart
                    attack. Meir used to quip, “I always told people I had a big heart.”) Ely's call
                    was to tell me, “I have a message for you from my government. [pause] We know
                    that you have been active in Romanian affairs and my government wants you to
                    know that we have special relations with the Government of Romania, and some of
                    the things you are doing are interfering with that relationship. In particular,
                    your intervention to save the Great Synagogue in Romania . . ..” I replied,
                    “Ely, is that the message?” He said, “Yes.” I then said, “Ely, please tell your
                    government that I am going to do whatever I can to save the Great Synagogue, and
                    I don't care what your government thinks.” Ely shot back, “I read the message
                    from my government. On a personal note, I agree with you,” and hung up.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what was going on over there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Ceausescu was building the Avenue for the Victory of Socialism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yeah, this horrible...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: He tore down two square miles in the center of Bucharest. The Great
                    Synagogue was in the way. The small Jewish community that remained felt an
                    attachment to the Great Synagogue. Certainly the Chief Rabbi did and asked me to
                    do what I could to save the Great Synagogue. Which I did. I was at State a great
                    deal in the '80s. Roz Ridgeway always met with me. It was easier for me to see
                    assistant secretaries then than today. I always saw Hal Saunders, Roz, Ed
                    Djerejian, Nick Veliotes. They were very open, very welcoming. Secretary Schultz
                    on the margins of the UN General Assembly meeting in 1988 buttonholed Foreign
                    Minister Tutu and told him that if the Great Synagogue was destroyed, it would
                    irreparably harm the relationship between our two countries. That is what saved
                    the Great Synagogue. It was Roz and George Schultz. I was the instigator. I had
                    no official position that merited attention. But I came away from my White House
                    service, and I say this with total immodesty, with a good reputation in
                    Washington. People paid attention to what I had to say. I had an op-ed piece in
                    The New York Times, a couple of op-ed pieces in The Washington Post. I had
                    friends at State who looked out for me. Although a Democrat, I was regularly
                    invited to the Secretary's or the Vice President's dinners for Israeli prime
                    ministers' visits. This continued through the Bush years. These were people I
                    had worked with and who were thoughtful and considerate in including me. During
                    this period, I was also close to successive Israeli ambassadors. I would go to
                    official dinners the U.S. government gave as well as the dinners the Israeli
                    government gave.</p>

                        the role of George Bush but also those around Reagan. Reagan as with most
                        administrations, the foreign policy evolved. Mainly it was a learning curve
                        than anything else. If you could talk a bit about that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Great.OK, today is 20 July 2005. Well let's start, you
                        were working with the Reagan Administration. Again what were you doing with
                        them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: I didn't work for the Reagan Administration, again I was active and
                    involved on Jewish issues, Israel and the fate of the Jewish community in
                    Romania. It was on these two prongs that I had dealings with the Reagan
                    Administration, primarily the Department of State. Coming into office, Reagan
                    was an unknown quantity on Middle East issues. He had some limited dealings with
                    people in the entertainment community in Hollywood who were Jewish, most
                    specifically Lew Wasserman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was an agent...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: No, Wasserman was a major figure in the motion picture industry. He owned
                    Universal Studios, and had employed Reagan. He always referred to him as Ronnie.
                    He was then, I suppose, in his 80's, some ten years or so older than Reagan.
                    There was a mutual fondness and respect between the two. Reagan had this
                    exposure to the Jewish world through Hollywood. He came here, if I read him
                    correctly, with a sympathy for Israel which wasn't shared by everyone in his
                    entourage either in the White House or in the State Department, certainly not by
                    Casper Weinberger, Secretary of Defense. Two things happened. You had the
                    Israeli invasion of Lebanon which produced enormous tension when Israeli troops
                    surrounded Beirut. The United States negotiated Yasser Arafat's departure from
                    Beirut to Tunis with a goodly number of PLO forces. That averted an Israeli
                    occupation of Beirut. But along the way Israeli forces and U.S. forces looked
                    each other in the eye, and at one point it got ugly. Weinberger said some
                    negative things about Israel, and Israeli forces. Phil Habib, who was President
                    Reagan's special envoy at that point was able to defuse the situation, but it
                    was a bit ugly. Alexander Haig was Secretary of State. He was straight up
                    ex-military, who when he was no longer Secretary of State, was very sympathetic
                    to Israel. But, as Secretary, he didn't show that same understanding of Israel's
                    isolation and security concerns. He was succeeded by George Schultz, who, coming
                    from Bechtel Corporation with extensive business dealings in Saudi Arabia and
                    elsewhere in the Middle East, was thought to be anti-Israel. That later changed
                    dramatically.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well part of the thing was that Bechtel had done a hell of
                        a lot of building in the middle east.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: That is absolutely true, but Schultz himself when he originally came in
                    made a statement (I can't recall the exact date, but I think it was in August of
                    '82), which was very confrontational vis-a-vis Israel. It was clearly
                    unfriendly. But that changed, and it changed within a year or so when he
                    concluded that the Syrians were lying to him, that Assad was lying to him. After
                    that, he became much more sympathetic to Israel's concerns. He had very close
                    contacts in the Jewish community including a prot�g� at the University of
                    Chicago, a young economist who was Jewish. He was killed or died, I am not sure
                    which, some 20+ years before. Schultz ended up being enormously supportive and
                    understanding of Israel. At the same time it was he who reached out in '88 to
                    Yasser Arafat at Stockholm to end the no-talk policy with the PLO. It was
                    aborted a year or two later when Leon Klinghoffer was killed by a Palestinian
                    terrorist and thrown off a ship in the Mediterranean.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Abu Nidal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Abu Nidal, exactly. The United States again broke off relations with the
                    PLO. That was under Jim Baker. We didn't talk to the PLO officially again until
                    after the Oslo Accords in 1993. That was under Bill Clinton. Schultz started out
                    being seen as hostile to Israel, then swung the other way. He was also very
                    supportive of Jewish interests world wide. He attended a Seder in Moscow in 1986
                    or 1987 arranged by our embassy. The embassy person who arranged that Seder was
                    Mike Einik, later my DCM in Bucharest. He was then a political or economic
                    officer in the U.S. mission in Moscow. Dick Schifter, our Assistant Secretary of
                    State for Human Rights, was with Schultz in Moscow. It was he who asked the
                    Secretary to attend the Seder. Schultz told the Soviet Foreign Ministry he had
                    to leave a meeting to attend a Seder at the American Embassy, a clear message at
                    a time when the exodus of Jews from the Soviet Union was a big issue. The
                    “Seder” commemorates the exodus of Jews from Egypt over 3000 years before. As I
                    said earlier, it was Schultz who was instrumental in saving the Great Synagogue
                    in Bucharest when he told the Foreign Minister of Romania on the margins of the
                    General Assembly in New York that if the Great Synagogue was destroyed, it would
                    have serious repercussions for our bilateral relationships. He was very
                    understanding. He met regularly with Jewish leadership. I attended those
                    meetings. He would spend an hour or two just going over the issues. He was
                    accessible and very effective talking with Jewish leadership. It would usually
                    be a group of eight or ten. I don't recall White House meetings. Most of my
                    dealings in the Reagan years were with the State Department.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was the 16 I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: The F-15 was produced by McDonnell-Douglas. Yet, Senator Jack Danforth
                    from Missouri opposed the sale. That was very courageous on his part. He voted
                    for the AWACs sale, but later told me the Administration had lied to him. Jack
                    was, and is, a Republican. When the F-15 issue came up, even though that sale
                    was important to his state because there were McDonnell-Douglas assembly plants
                    in Missouri, he voted against it. I don't believe I was involved in Israeli arms
                    sales issues. I was of two minds on that. I understood Israel's belief that it
                    needed a robust arms industry to supply the IDF, and that unless it sold arms
                    overseas, it couldn't support the industry. In other words, the requirements of
                    the IDF were not sufficient, in and of themselves, to support a broad-based arms
                    industry. That may be true, but I never felt that I, as an American Jew, should
                    be taking a position on those issues, and to the extent that Israel was selling
                    arms that had an American component and those sales were prohibited under
                    agreements between our country and Israel, I supported the position of the
                    United States Government. My loyalties are to the United States, and if there is
                    a bilateral agreement, the Israelis should live up to it. That is my view, but I
                    have never been involved where I had to make the choice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have talked to some people who have been involved at the
                        State Department on the economic control side and found this to be a very
                        difficult issue.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: It is a troublesome issue, and I am sympathetic to Israel, but, if you
                    make a deal, you should stick to it. It was foolish on the part of Israel
                    because in the final analysis the security of the State of Israel depends on the
                    United States, and it should do nothing to weaken or jeopardize the
                    relationship.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the Bush I administration, this is '89 to '93, were
                        you involved in that?</hi>

                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>MOSES: I was at the White House frequently. I met with Brent Scowcroft several
                    times. I met with President Bush in New York at the Waldorf Astoria, a meeting
                    that lasted several hours. I was at the White House from time to time for
                    meetings on Jewish issues. I was at State regularly, and met two or three times
                    with Secretary Baker. We developed a friendship in the last year or so of the
                    Bush administration. He had softened a bit at the edges and was reaching out to
                    the Jewish community. But these were also times of great tension, particularly
                    when several thousand American Jews came to Washington to lobby for credits for
                    the Government of Israel to build housing for Soviet Jews flowing into
                    Israel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That had to do with settlements on the West Bank didn't
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: No, it wasn't the settlements issue. I have never supported the
                    settlements. I did support the credits. The construction was to be within the
                    Green Line; much of it was in the Negev around Beersheba and other areas to the
                    south. Bush made a statement from the White House which talked about “those
                    people,” and that he was the one lone guy up here protecting our government. He
                    did not say these Jews are here trying to wheedle money out of the Congress, but
                    it was pretty ugly. That is the reason a few weeks later he met with us in New
                    York. There were other tense moments. Jim Baker could be acerbic. In answer to a
                    question in testimony before the House International Relations Committee, he
                    said in effect that if the Israelis wanted to talk to him, they knew his
                    telephone number, the telephone number of the State Department or the White
                    House, whatever it was, and they should call. He was fed up with then Prime
                    Minister Yitzhak Shamir. But in late 1991 there was also the Madrid Conference.
                    The Palestinian delegation was present, the Syrian delegation was present, the
                    Israel delegation. So that was a time of hope. I met with Shamir frequently,
                    offered advice, sometimes to the Israeli ambassador in Washington. I met from
                    time to time in Israel with Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, leaders of the Labor
                    Party, both ex-prime ministers. So it was an exciting time, a time of movement
                    and hope, particularly after the first Gulf War. I went to Israel on the second
                    day of the Gulf War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you get involved with essentially keeping Israel,
                        our concern that Israel might enter the Gulf War and screw things up?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>MOSES: I went to Israel, I think, on the 19th of January, maybe the first day of
                    the war, certainly immediately after the first SCUD landed in Israel. I stayed a
                    few days. Deputy Secretary of State Larry Eagleburger came to calm the Israelis
                    who were threatening to attack Iraq in retaliation for the SCUD attacks. He
                    promised the Israelis that the United States would supply Israel with Patriot
                    missiles. In return, Shamir made the decision not to intervene, which is what
                    the United States wanted. This was over the objection of Moshe Arens who was
                    then Defense Minister. Moshe is a good friend. We were together for dinner the
                    last time I was in Israel. Moshe's view was that Israel should take whatever
                    military action it deemed appropriate, in its own interest, regardless of what
                    the United States wanted. But that view did not prevail. I am glad it didn't.
                    There was tension over this issue. That was an Israeli decision. If I gave
                    counsel, and I don't remember whether I did, my advice would have been not to
                    intervene. In my view, as long as the United States was extending military cover
                    for Israel, it should remain on the sidelines. As it turned out, the Patriots
                    were useless, but none of us knew that. Psychologically, they were important. I
                    did work very closely with the Israelis on the post-war aid package. The
                    Israelis received about $600 million as compensation. Baker had told the
                    Israelis to wait, not seek aid immediately after the war. He promised to look
                    out for Israeli interests in a supplemental appropriation later. Here I think I
                    did make a difference. I strongly urged Zalman Shoval, the Israeli ambassador,
                    not to wait. He asked for my counsel on whether Israel should press ahead for
                    the $600 million or wait. The problem with Baker's promise was that in the
                    interim Israel would be hostage to the State Department. If Israel incurred the
                    displeasure of Baker, there went the promise. I told Shoval that Baker is above
                    all a realist. He respects power and resolve. Israel suffered real economic loss
                    as a result of the war. A promise of future aid might not result in anything
                    material. Shoval voiced concerns about the exercise of power and how this would
                    be perceived. I replied that, “You don't have power unless you are prepared to
                    exercise it, and this is the time. Otherwise, you are going to be seen as the
                    mouse that roared.” He brought in two other advisors. I persuaded them as well,
                    although they were not entirely convinced it was the right decision. Then, in my
                    presence, Shoval called AIPAC to tell it Israel was going ahead with the aid
                    package. So there, I think, I was instrumental in getting the Israelis to do
                    what I thought was right. It was not what Jim Baker thought, or wanted the
                    Israelis to do. But I frankly thought Baker was putting them off. I think I was
                    right.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then when the Clinton administration came in, in '93,
                        in the first place did you play any role during the election campaign?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>MOSES: The only role that I recall is that I got a call from the Clinton campaign
                    in Little Rock telling me that Governor Clinton was going to meet with Yitzhak
                    Rabin and would I write a paper for Clinton to use as talking points. It was a
                    hell of a good paper. But unbeknownst to me Martin Indyk was also asked to write
                    a paper. I don't know who asked Martin; I know who asked me. My guess is Sandy
                    Berger or Tony Lake, someone higher up in the campaign, made the request. Martin
                    may have actually been in Little Rock. He wrote the paper that Clinton actually
                    used, and then became Clinton's principal advisor for Middle East issues, then
                    Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, and still later our
                    ambassador to Israel. I don't think Clinton ever saw my paper. I didn't see
                    Martin's but I am sure it was excellent. That was the only thing that I recall
                    doing in the campaign. I met Clinton a couple of times, but I was not involved
                    in the campaign. I was not a financial contributor to Clinton. His financial
                    head, Mickey Kantor, called me, but I was out of town. It was in the summer, and
                    I was in Maine. I am sure he was calling to ask for money. That was his job. I
                    missed his call, so that when I became ambassador a year and a half later, I was
                    probably the only political appointee who had never given a nickel to
                    Clinton.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well come to the point, how did you become Ambassador to
                        Romania?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>MOSES: That is very straightforward. I had been active for some 15 years getting
                    Jews out of Romania. This began in February '76 and continued until Ceausescu
                    was overthrown in 1989. Thereafter I continued to go to Romania once or twice a
                    year to meet with the Jewish community and in particular with then Chief Rabbi
                    Moses Rosen. In the fall of 1993 I had lunch with my friend and deputy when I
                    was in the White House, Marc Grossman, who was Executive Secretary in the State
                    Department. Marc reminded me that I had once thought about being ambassador to
                    Romania. He said now was the time. Our then ambassador, John Davis, planned to
                    retire and there would be an opening. If I was still interested, I should get
                    moving. The opportunity as well as the challenge grabbed me. Then the reality
                    sank in. I knew neither President Clinton nor Vice President Gore; they owed me
                    nothing. How was I going to become ambassador? It would probably go to a foreign
                    service officer or someone close to the Clinton Administration, and I was
                    neither. Marc was not unmoved by my reality check — “At least make the effort,”
                    he said with a big smile. I thought he was telling me that if my candidacy
                    gained traction, State would not push for its career person. At least that is
                    what I inferred from the conversation. I was hooked. That night I mentioned it
                    casually to Carol, my wife, who thought it was a nutty idea, that it wouldn't
                    happen so why not go ahead and try. Next was Barbara, our oldest daughter, who,
                    not knowing the odds, thought it was a great idea. So I started thinking about
                    people who might help. President Carter was first. I called Jimmy. He
                    immediately said, “Sure, send me a letter so that I know what you have done that
                    is relevant.” He promised to call President Clinton. And he did. My friend Lane
                    Kirkland was head of the AFL. Lane was supportive. At the time the Clinton
                    Administration was reaching out to Lane. The AFL opposed NAFTA. The
                    Administration had already won that fight and was looking for ways to
                    re-establish its important relationship with organized labor. I had a friend and
                    client, a lawyer in Arkansas, Lou Ramsey, who had been chairman of the Board of
                    Trustees of the University of Arkansas when Bill Clinton went from Yale to
                    Arkansas to teach law. Lou made a strong pitch for me. Through my position as
                    President of the American Jewish Committee, I also knew people at the White
                    House. Rahm Emanuel was very helpful. I also got a big boost from another
                    friend, Dick Schifter, a Senior Director on the National Security staff at the
                    White House. Unknown to me at the time, Dick sent a strong note to Sandy Berger
                    and Tony Lake. So they endorsed me. I didn't know either Sandy or Tony, but
                    Sandy in particular went out of his way to tell me later that he thought I was
                    “a natural,” knowing Romania as I did. At the time, I did not know this had come
                    from Dick. I had also been reasonably prominent as Carter's special counsel,
                    President of the American Jewish Committee, and a partner in Covington &amp;
                    Burling. This background was also a fit for Sandy and Tony. They both became
                    friends, wonderful people. I called a few senators I knew, Joe Lieberman and
                    Paul Simon, whose staff aide had been at State and worked with me on Romanian
                    issues, and one or two other Hill people. It all came together. By early January
                    '94 I was able to tell Chief Rabbi Rosen, when I saw him briefly in Washington,
                    that I would probably be the next American ambassador to Romania. He was
                    delighted. Unfortunately, he died two months later. The President approved my
                    nomination in July, my name went to the Senate a few days later, and I was
                    confirmed in September. It all started in 1976 when I got the first Jews out of
                    Romania. The fact that I knew something about the country certainly helped. I
                    knew Ion Iliescu, Romania's president. I hosted a breakfast for him when he was
                    in Washington for the opening of the Holocaust Memorial Museum in 1993. I knew
                    Romania's Foreign Minister, Adrian N?stase. I hosted a lunch for him in
                    Washington when he visited in 1991. In return he hosted a dinner for me in
                    Bucharest two years later. So I knew my way around. I knew the country,
                    something about its emerging leadership. I looked forward to the chance to be
                    operational on foreign policy issues, always a great love and interest of
                    mine.</p>

                <p>MOSES: From December '94 (I delayed because my wife was operated on for ovarian
                    cancer in November). I didn't go out until the 9th of December. My oldest
                    daughter, Barbara, and I arrived in Bucharest on a snowy Sunday morning in
                    December. My ambassadorship ended September 1, 1997.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well when you went out there, late '94, what was the state
                        of relations between the United States and Romania?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>MOSES: There was a lot of suspicion on the Hill and in parts of the
                    administration concerning Romania's political legitimacy, whether its leaders
                    were truly reformed former communists or persons whose world views still
                    reflected pre-1989 communist doctrines. In other words, had Iliescu, et al. just
                    changed labels. Official Washington had not embraced Romania as it had Hungary,
                    Czechoslovakia and Poland. Romania was still viewed with a great deal of
                    suspicion. The official relationship was correct, but not warm. The
                    ever-sensitive Romanians felt unloved, a little like an unwanted child
                    acknowledged to exist but not loved. Washington thought of Romania as an
                    out-of-the-way destination of no real importance. True or not, it did not deter
                    official visitors — the high and mighty and lots of other folk. Dick Holbrooke
                    and his now wife were the first to arrive, giving a big boost to me personally,
                    but also our entire embassy staff. The irrepressible Dick was at his best, a tad
                    less on subsequent visits. President George H.W. Bush and Mrs. Bush were next,
                    spending two days in Romania. They, like the Holbrooke's, stayed with me at the
                    residence. Both were delightful — President Bush and I swapping stories in the
                    sauna at the end of a busy day and then up the next morning for tennis; he
                    meeting and greeting the embassy staff and others. Having them was truly a
                    treasure. But there were lots of others. Over the next three years we hosted
                    numerous CODELs from both the Senate and the House, CEOs such as Procter &amp;
                    Gamble's John Pepper and Lockheed's Norm Augustine, both of whom were
                    roll-up-the-sleeves guys. Senator Robert Dole spent two days with me in
                    Bucharest, as did Senator Charles Robb, along with numerous other government
                    officials and Hill staffers. There were no major gaffes but lots of uneasy
                    moments. To name only a few, I persuaded the Romanian Government to give Dick
                    Holbrooke a gift after his success at Dayton. This was the post-communist era
                    when medals and the like were verboten. Not to be outdone, President Iliescu's
                    staff at the last minute came up with a gift that most closely resembled the
                    Biblical golden calf. When Dick reached out to touch it, I hurriedly whispered
                    in his ear, “Watch out, the gold paint is still wet.” So, too, with some of the
                    CODELs. Long-time Congressman Floyd Spence of South Carolina who had had several
                    heart attacks, traveled with his nurse who had by then also become his wife. He
                    hopped from country to country at a whirlwind pace and was never quite sure
                    where he was. To avoid embarrassment, he always said, “I am delighted to be in
                    your country,” whatever its name might be. Not so for Senator Robb. During his
                    visit he was preoccupied with the situation in Bosnia, asking everyone from
                    President Constantinescu on down what the United States should do in Bosnia,
                    never bothering to ask about Romania. The high point for us in the embassy were
                    the visits of First Lady Hillary Clinton and then President William J. Clinton.
                    The visits were a year apart. Hillary came first, arriving in Bucharest on a hot
                    July day, the first stop on a multi-country tour of Central Europe, we thought
                    with an eye toward the ethnic vote in the upcoming November presidential
                    elections. When I went on board the plane to greet her, she was frosty. I was
                    later told that she was upset by a news report that Barbara Streisand had spent
                    the previous night at the White House. We got off to a slow start but as the day
                    progressed, she became more and more open and friendly to the point where, at
                    the end of the day, returning to her hotel, she said, “O.k., Al, let's go
                    schmooze the press.” When we approached the gaggle of press people, she opened
                    by saying to them, “You know Ambassador Moses, don't you?” With no prompting
                    from me, the Reuters correspondent replied, “We sure do; he is the best American
                    ambassador anywhere.” True or not, Hillary had heard enough. She turned to me
                    and said goodnight.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>The real spectacular was the visit of President Clinton. This was a real coup for
                    Romania. No American president had visited since Gerald Ford, more than 20 years
                    before. Romania is pro-American like no other country in Central Europe. Five
                    hundred thousand people turned out to hear the President, up until then the
                    largest crowd he had ever addressed. His speech was masterful, written by his
                    speechwriters with a few strokes from Sandy Berger and me. The crowd loved it
                    and so did Clinton. Afterward the two of us motored around Bucharest, stopping
                    first at a peasant museum where he bought armfuls of Romanian products, charming
                    people every step of the way. Later he addressed the embassy staff, Peace Corps
                    and other Americans in Bucharest. They loved it, as did I. On the trip together
                    to the airport we talked about personal things. My mother had died two days
                    before, and he was very supportive. We also talked about Chelsea's career path,
                    NATO expansion, Washington politics and you-name-it. I then flew with him in Air
                    Force One back to Washington.</p>
                <p>When the President visits a foreign country (officially coded POTUS), it is a
                    drop-in with two 747s loaded with White House staff, cabinet members, press and
                    various others. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Deputy Secretary of
                    State Strobe Talbott along with National Security Advisor Sandy Berger were in
                    the Presidential entourage. Later when we met with President Constantinescu, I
                    was seated next to the President after which came Albright, Berger and Talbott.
                    In a failed effort at humor, I turned to Madeleine, and said, “We must be seated
                    chronologically.” (I was by far the oldest.) Madeline ignored my attempt to
                    lighten up, replying in a straightforward manner, “Oh, no, Alfred, you as the
                    U.S. ambassador in Romania are the President's personal representative in
                    country,” something I hardly needed to be told.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is tape 4 side 1 with Ambassador Moses.Well with this
                        feeling, what was your impression of the government of Romania? Do you feel
                        that this is in our eyes a legitimate government that was really grabbing
                        control or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>MOSES: It was already in control. I also concluded it was legitimate. The '92
                    elections were determined by international election observers to be fair.
                    Certainly, the outcome was not subject to challenge. Iliescu had been elected
                    president, but his party (PDSR) did not have a majority in the parliament. PDSR
                    had a working relationship with PRM, the far right cripto-Fascist Greater
                    Romanian Party, and with PUNR, a Romanian nationalist party based in
                    Transylvania. There was also a former Communist Party, now socialist party
                    (PSM), in the parliament, headed by Adrian Paunescu who had various official
                    positions in the Ceausescu days. He supported the government. The opposition was
                    composed of the Peasant Party (Christian Democrats) and the PD, a left-of-center
                    party, headed by Petre Roman who had been Prime Minister under Iliescu in
                    1990-91. But Iliescu was clearly the key figure. His prime minister, Nikolae
                    Vacariou, an economist of no great renown, did not speak English and was not a
                    major player. He was something of a hot house plant serving Iliescu. Foreign
                    Minister Teodor Mele?canu was very suave, sophisticated, spoke multiple
                    languages, and was effective. The Minister of Defense, Gheorghe Tinca, had spent
                    his entire career in the Foreign Ministry, but the governing party, PDSR, was
                    short of competent English speakers to head ministries. Our Secretary of
                    Defense, Bill Perry, liked Tinca. I liked him, too, but he was nothing
                    exceptional. All in all, it was a legitimate government. It made mistakes,
                    especially on economic policy, but by and large was moving in the right
                    direction and desperately wanted a closer relationship with the United States.
                    It was suspicious of most European countries, particularly Germany, that it
                    feared, and France, that it mistrusted. I moved on the bilateral front with
                    considerable success. The Romanian Government did most of the things I
                    suggested. This was without instructions from my government. After I had been
                    ambassador two months or so, I laid down a six-point demarche in a meeting with
                    Iliescu. Iliescu took great umbrage, exclaiming that not even Brezhnev had
                    spoken to the Romanian Government the way I did. To which I responded, “That may
                    be, but I am a better friend of Romania than Brezhnev.” Iliescu was silent. It
                    was a pretty tense session. There were only four of us in the room: Iliescu,
                    Mele?canu, my DCM Jonathan Rickert and I. Jonathan gulped hard and all but fell
                    off his chair.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Jonathan Rickert. He was not used to a free-wheeling Washington lawyer
                    playing diplomat. But it brought results, and, deservedly or not, the first year
                    I was in Romania, I was seen as an enormous hero. I was continuously on radio
                    and television. The Romanians were lapping it up, because I was a real
                    personality. I was out there on the street; I was going to public events
                    throughout the country. I was pushing hard on the issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were they, there were six points you said.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>MOSES: The first thing I took up was the role of the extremist parties — PUNR,
                    PRM and PSM — that had formed a working coalition in the parliament with
                    Iliescu's party, PDSR. I called for an end to the working arrangement. This was
                    done in the fall of 1996. My remarks were repeated publicly and I was attacked
                    in the press and on television by the extremist parties, one on the right (PRM),
                    one on the left (PSM) and one nationalist, anti-Hungarian (PUNR). I next took up
                    the government's dealing with ethnic minorities, primarily Hungarians and Roma
                    (Gypsies). This, too, improved over time. The government entered into a basic
                    treaty with Hungary as a stepping stone for Romania's entry into Euro/Atlantic
                    structures. The treaty was signed the following year. Efforts underway in
                    Romania to rehabilitate Marshall Ion Antonescu, Romania's wartime Fascist
                    president/dictator, were also on the list. I urged Iliescu to take the steps
                    necessary to disassociate himself and his government in words and deeds from all
                    such efforts by the pro-Antonescu cult. This, too, happened. At the time of my
                    meeting with Iliescu the Romanian Government was “purging” elected opposition
                    officials at the prefect (county) and mayor level. I told him this had to stop
                    and it did. Lastly, I pushed for an improved supply of news print and at better
                    prices for Romanian newspapers. The opposition press was screaming that the
                    pro-government press was being favored. This was resolved and at my urging the
                    government approved the license of a privately owned national TV channel. Where
                    I failed was in not persuading Iliescu to speed up genuine privatization and to
                    take concrete steps to facilitate direct foreign investment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They all would be nationalities there then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Yes, exactly. We had a treaty between Romania and Hungary, a treaty
                    between the Ukraine and Romania. That came after Iliescu's term of office. It
                    was done under Emil Constantinescu in '97, but I was instrumental in getting
                    both treaties signed, actually talking to the Hungarians and Ukrainians, going
                    to Kiev to negotiate the Ukrainian-Romanian treaty and working with the
                    Hungarian Government and our government as well as with the Romanians to
                    finalize the Hungarian treaty. I was the chief negotiator in concluding both
                    treaties, something no normal ambassador would do if he was in his right mind. I
                    did it and it worked out, so no one fired me once I succeeded. I remember
                    telling Strobe Talbott about the Ukraine Treaty, then being negotiated. He gave
                    his approval reluctantly but was obviously concerned that the Russians would see
                    it as anti-Russian which it wasn't. But at least he didn't stop me, though I
                    think, if he had his druthers, he would have. As I said, by the fall of '96,
                    PDSR which was Iliescu's party had broken its working relationships with what I
                    called the extremist parties. The firing of mayors stopped. After the
                    Hungarian-Romanian treaty was signed, Hungarian-Romanian relations improved. So
                    we were able to change things in a rather dramatic fashion. In return, I was
                    able to arrange for Iliescu to meet with President Clinton in the Oval Office in
                    September 1995 which was enormously important for Iliescu. Sandy Berger arranged
                    the meeting at my behest. I stayed at Iliescu's side the entire four or five
                    days he was in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had he been here before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: He had never been in the Oval Office. He was here for the opening of the
                    Holocaust Memorial Museum in April '93, but that was it. A month after the Oval
                    Office visit, he went to Houston at the invitation of former President Bush that
                    I had arranged after President and Mrs. Bush visited Romania in April '95. They
                    stayed at the residence. They both liked Iliescu. Later I called and asked
                    President Bush if he would meet with Iliescu who was planning to attend an
                    energy conference in Houston organized by Joe Grandmaison, the director of the
                    U.S. Trade and Development Agency. President Bush said yes. He very graciously
                    hosted a cocktail reception for Iliescu at his home and then a dinner at his
                    country club. It was a lovely thing for him to do, just spectacular. A year
                    later, Romania obtained permanent MFN status, i.e., most favored nation tariff
                    status. Deserved or not, Iliescu credited me with this. To an extent he was
                    right. There had been a policy debate in the Administration on this issue. Five
                    or six of us were involved. I was able to persuade all but one that the
                    Administration should support permanent MFN status for Romania. The lone
                    dissenter, Dan Fried, is now our Assistant Secretary of State for European
                    Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ??? a lovely guy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Dan didn't see it the same way. He later became a strong supporter of
                    Romania and Iliescu, but at that time he was not convinced that Romania had
                    progressed far enough. Nevertheless, he went along with the majority and we got
                    it done. I was also able to bring the Romanians on board to sign the
                    anti-chemical warfare treaty. In doing so, I insisted that the Minister of
                    Defense, Gheorghe Tinca, sign it himself. I did this because I had doubts about
                    the bona fides of the Romanian Government's commitment. I thought they were
                    cheating on weapons issues with reported sales to Iran and Iraq. I wanted
                    Tinca's signature so I could stick it to him if I later found that they were
                    violating the Treaty.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had they had a substantial chemical warfare?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>MOSES: There were rumors, and there were also intelligence reports that Romania
                    had sold some arms, or other embargoed materials, to Iraq and Iran. I watched
                    this very closely. I had also intervened and then directed the action whereby
                    the Romanian Internal Security Service had apprehended and deported a member of
                    the Japanese Red Army, a notorious terrorist organization. Generally, the
                    relationship between our two countries was moving in the right direction. It
                    improved dramatically when Constantinescu won the election in November, 1996,
                    and became president. Romania then had a Christian Democratic coalition
                    government headed by a Christian Democratic Prime Minister, Victor Ciorbea.
                    Romania was seen much more positively in official Washington. Neither the
                    Administration nor the Hill, particularly the Republican right, had ever fully
                    accepted Iliescu. As a result of the '96 Romanian election, the relationship
                    between Romania and the United States vastly improved, but during the entire
                    three years I was there it was on an upward trajectory. We were able to make
                    considerable progress across the board. We opened the doors for U.S. businesses
                    interested in making direct investments in Romania. Procter &amp; Gamble was a
                    good example. Tenneco came to Romania but later withdrew. Bell Helicopter was
                    there. Chase Bank and Citicorp had operations in Romania as did Xerox and IBM.
                    General Motors and General Electric were both in the wings with small
                    investments. I called Gary Wendt, the president of General Electric Capital, to
                    interest him in possibly acquiring a bank in Romania. He sent a couple of people
                    to Romania from Budapest and later made an investment in a Romanian bank. Top
                    people from Boeing and Lockheed visited, as did McDonnell-Douglas's COO. They
                    wanted to sell aircraft. I pushed Romania to buy U.S. aircraft for TAROM, its
                    civilian airline that had four Airbuses. We developed traction and did fairly
                    well. Also in agriculture. It was an active time and the United States was top
                    dog in Bucharest. This meant that I as the American ambassador was top dog. I
                    saw Iliescu with great frequency. This was also true of his successor, Emil
                    Constantinescu, who was equally open, accessible, warm and friendly. I have
                    tried to maintain those relationships. When I was in Bucharest in May of this
                    year with President Clinton, I saw Emil. We had a wonderful talk. The next day I
                    went to see Iliescu who was in hospital. I gave him an autographed copy of
                    President Clinton's book that he inscribed with a personal message to Iliescu.
                    True to form, Iliescu gave me a copy of his book similarly inscribed to
                    Clinton.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you, was the issue of joining NATO and the European
                        Union a major issue while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>MOSES: For Iliescu and Constantinescu, joining NATO was the preoccupation. A
                    preliminary decision had been taken at a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in
                    Sintra, Portugal, in May '97, confirmed at the NATO Summit Meeting in Madrid the
                    second week of July, that Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland would be
                    invited to join NATO, not Romania or Slovenia, the other serious contenders.
                    There was considerable disappointment in Romania. Constantinescu agreed to live
                    with the decision, as did Romania's foreign minister, Adrian Severin, who had
                    gotten into a row with Madeleine Albright at Sintra. At one point Madeleine had
                    said the decision would be made on the merits, whereupon Severin spoke up,
                    saying, “That means Romania will get in.” Madeleine was visibly shaken. She felt
                    she had been outfoxed and embarrassed by a “nobody” foreign minister from an
                    unimportant country. But the fact is the United States did not handle the
                    situation as well as we should have. We should have let the Romanians know much
                    earlier that we were not going to support their candidacy. Other governments, at
                    least nominally, did support Romania's NATO bid. Rather than have it sprawl over
                    to Sintra, we should have stated our position before the foreign ministers'
                    meeting. There were nine countries supporting Romania, two opposed; the other
                    five did not declare one way or the other. The two opposed were the United
                    States and Iceland. Constantinescu immediately called me to ask, “Mr.
                    Ambassador, what did Romania ever do to Iceland?” I thought that was a pretty
                    good line. The obvious answer was “nothing.” The French, for their part, gave
                    the appearance of supporting Romania's bid. Germany's chancellor, Helmut Kohl,
                    told the Romanian ambassador in Bonn that Germany would not stand in the way of
                    Romania's joining NATO. He could say this because he knew the United States had
                    already made its decision. It was a free vote for him. Chirac also knew that in
                    the end Romania was not going to get in. He was able to declare support because
                    he knew it was not going to happen. His principal interest was Poland. The same
                    for Kohl. But Chirac wanted to keep faith with a Francophone country, i.e.,
                    Romania, so he gave lip service to support; the Romanians understood this. They
                    knew the game even but didn't acknowledge it. Nevertheless, the Romanians pushed
                    very hard. In June '97 Victor Ciorbea, the prime minister, was in Washington. He
                    came back a second time to see Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott. He had
                    seen Madeleine on the first visit and asked to come back a few days later to
                    push again for Romania's NATO bid. It was a mistake on Ciorbea's part. I
                    counseled him against doing this before he left Bucharest for Washington. I met
                    him at the airport and made it clear that whatever the U.S. decision turned out
                    to be, he had to accept it. He could not appeal to the Congress over the head of
                    the Administration. First of all, it wouldn't work, and, second, it would be
                    seen by the Administration for what it was. The decision had already been taken.
                    Basically, he was in over his head. He had no foreign policy experience and
                    behaved in an immature and inexperienced way. He had done nothing in public life
                    before becoming prime minister other than serving a few months as mayor of
                    Bucharest. The fact is that the entire political opposition in Romania pre-1996
                    had no government experience. Under the Communists there was no opposition. From
                    December '89 to December '96 it was Iliescu all the way. Constantinescu was a
                    professor, Ciorbea a lawyer. They knew little about government. Both proved
                    inept in office. So there were these problems I had to deal with as well.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Jewish question in Romania or was there
                        one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: There is always a Jewish question. Even where there are no Jews, there is
                    a Jewish question. It just seems to be part of human existence. When I arrived
                    in Romania, there were 12,000-15,000 Jews left, mainly elderly. There were
                    outbreaks of anti-Semitism from time to time, regularly in the press on the part
                    of the PRM, the Greater Romanian Party and its leader Vadim Tudor. There was a
                    lot of vitriolic anti-Semitism in Romania Mare, the PRM newspaper. I was the
                    object of a good deal of that. There were issues regarding restoration of
                    property (community and individual) that had been taken by the Fascists and
                    later by the Communists. We resolved those issues in theory, but nothing
                    actually happened. Mele?canu and later Severin, successive Romanian foreign
                    ministers, said the right things, as did the respective Romanian presidents, but
                    there was little to show in the way of deliverables. This is still true. There
                    was also the issue of the state archives. The United States Holocaust Museum
                    wanted to look at materials dating from the period leading up to WWII, the war
                    years and beyond. That was very difficult. The Romanian archivists weren't
                    cooperative. I had spoken to Iliescu as had the Holocaust Museum's
                    representative. Iliescu visited the Holocaust Museum in '95 when he came for the
                    Oval Office visit. He promised cooperation, and I think he tried. His Chief de
                    Cabinet, Traian Chebeleu, and I met with officials at the National Archives.
                    There were promises, but it was always difficult and the results minimal. It was
                    never as full and open as it should have been. There were always reasons, but I
                    think they were excuses, not reasons. So that was a point of concern. The
                    relations between Israel and Romania were generally good. I was not involved in
                    the bilateral discussions. However, I accompanied Iliescu when he flew to
                    Jerusalem for Yitzhak Rabin's funeral in November '95. I do not recall that the
                    Israeli Foreign Minister visited Romania when I was ambassador, and I am quite
                    sure neither the Israeli Prime Minister nor the President did. But there were
                    delegations from Israel's parliament (the Knesset), and I would meet with them
                    at the invitation of the Israeli ambassador. There was no Romanian/Jewish crisis
                    per se during the time I was there. But there were always issues of one sort or
                    another relating to the fate, destiny and well-being of Romanian Jewry. I was
                    sympathetic, and our government was sympathetic. I wasn't introducing something
                    different from what had been U.S. policy during my predecessors' service. It was
                    a continuation of the policy of the U.S. Government to show concern for
                    ill-treated minorities. We had demonstrated the same interest and support for
                    the Roma community (the gypsy community), and there again I was active in trying
                    to improve the lot of the Roma in Romania.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well is there anything else we should discuss about your
                        time in Romania.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>MOSES: It was an exciting time. I firmly believe we accomplished a good deal. I
                    am told even today that I am looked upon as an historic ambassador who brought
                    about a change for the better in the bilateral relationship. It was so perceived
                    in official Washington, and in Bucharest as well. I was extremely active on all
                    fronts, whether it was meeting with the press, the Romanian Government or
                    Americans of all stripes. I was trying to push Romania in the right direction so
                    that it would become a more credible contender to be a NATO member (which it now
                    is), and eventually an EU member. In order for this to happen, Romania had to do
                    certain things. I stated this publicly and in many meetings with Romanian
                    government officials. I met frequently with the Romanian President. The meetings
                    dealt with matters of substance. I met almost daily with Prime Minister Ciorbea,
                    who spoke and understood English. His predecessor, Vacariou, always needed an
                    interpreter. My meetings with foreign ministers were no less frequent. The same
                    for ministers of defense — Gheorghe Tinca and his successor Victor Babiuc. Much
                    of the credit for whatever success I had in Romania goes to my staff. They were,
                    to a person, magnificent. Usually ambassadors end up canning one or two staff
                    members (my successor fired three secretaries in a row), or reprimanding people.
                    I never did either. I had no reason. The staff supported me and I supported
                    them. My two DCMs, Jonathan Rickert and Michael Einik, were highly experienced
                    in the region and knew Romania. Jonathan spoke Romanian, Mike's wife was born in
                    Romania; her family emigrated to Israel when she was still a girl. Our Public
                    Affairs Officer, Chris Filostrat, was gifted. He was later promoted to career
                    minister, the second highest rank in the foreign service. He steered me through
                    press conferences, advised me on speeches (which, not wisely, I wrote myself)
                    and was our face to the Romanian media. Our two consul generals, Nancy
                    Pelletreau and Susan Jacobs, were both tops. Nancy, who joined the foreign
                    service 40 years before as a secretary, managed to pull herself up by her
                    bootstraps, ending her career as U.S. Consul General in Romania. Susan upheld
                    the standard, later becoming U.S. ambassador to Papua New Guinea. My political
                    counselor, Robert Whitehead, was a true wordsmith. He was and is one of the
                    Department's most knowledgeable African experts, serving most recently as our
                    charg� in Khartoum. His wife, Agathe, a Rwandan who lost most of her family in
                    the 1994 massacre, was our CLO (Community Liaison Officer), coordinating
                    staff/family activities for the embassy. I was particularly close to Debra
                    Towry, Sarah Solberg and Mihai Carp, all of whom remain close personal friends
                    and have gone on to distinguished careers. There are lots of others I could and
                    should name, including our station chiefs, but the law does not permit it. The
                    embassy staff is always key to an ambassador's success but never more than in my
                    case. My wife, Carol, had intended to accompany me to Bucharest, but a month
                    before I was scheduled to go, she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. I initially
                    tendered my resignation, but Holbrooke and others at State insisted I go with
                    the understanding that I would return as often as needed to be with Carol. This
                    began a monthly ritual of trips back to Washington for up to ten days, or
                    longer. I tried to make up for my absence by working 14-16 hour days in Romania.
                    By and large, it worked. Carol came to Romania three times in three years, but
                    never felt well enough to stay long.</p>

                        Cyprus. How did you get involved in Cyprus?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: I was serving as American ambassador to Romania when my name was proposed
                    to be Special Presidential Envoy for the Cyprus Conflict. This was in '97. I
                    believe my name was proposed by Marc Grossman who was then the incoming
                    Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs. It moved right along. I met
                    with Madeleine Albright, and she in effect told me that I would be the Special
                    Envoy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: This was in '97. It didn't happen. Dick Holbrook swooped in. He had been
                    offered the job, or certainly was the leading candidate, but said he could not
                    do it because he was writing his book on Dayton. He visited with me in Bucharest
                    and told me the same thing. In fact, he said that I would be the Special Envoy.
                    What he didn't tell me was he had already changed his mind, and wanted the
                    job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: He became Special Envoy and I returned to my law practice. Two years later
                    Dick was nominated to be the U.S. Permanent Representative to the UN. So the
                    position was open again. For the second time, Marc Grossman put my name forward.
                    Thought was given to others such as Lee Hamilton. I understand that Madeleine
                    decided that Lee wasn't forceful enough. There was also talk of George Mitchell.
                    I think he turned it down. Tom Miller, who was serving as Cyprus Coordinator and
                    later became U.S. ambassador to Bosnia and then to Greece supported me and
                    persuaded Dick to support me. With Dick's support, and Marc's support, Madeleine
                    eventually agreed. I think she had been looking for a bigger name.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well let me say I am familiar. I never served in Cyprus,
                        but I was consul general in Greece for four years. I left Greece just before
                        the whole mess started where they put Samson in and the Turks came in and
                        all. But why would you as a successful lawyer here in Washington, want to
                        get into that can of worms?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: That is a good question. You could ask the same question about why did I
                    want to be ambassador to Romania.</p>
                <p>

                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>MOSES: If Romania is fun, Cyprus was a challenge. I like challenges, public
                    service and being involved. It was a perfect fit for me. I did not have to give
                    up my law practice. I served without compensation. The Government paid my
                    expenses but I was not otherwise compensated. I thought the issues were ripe for
                    resolution. I had no hesitation taking the job or any doubt that I was qualified
                    to do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what dealings had you had with Cyprus, the American
                        Greek community, the Greek Community and the Turkish?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Zero.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Zero. Probably just as well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: It didn't take very long to get on top of it. The Cyprus problem has a
                    complicated history. But it you get mired in the history, you never come up with
                    a solution. I didn't sense I was at a disadvantage because of my lack of
                    familiarity with the issues on the ground or not having had relationships with
                    either the Turkish-American community or the American Greek community. In a
                    relatively short time I was able to develop good relations with both of them,
                    very good with the Greek Foreign Minister, George Papandreou. We remain good
                    friends. I think my dealings in Ankara, with the Government of Turkey, were
                    equally good. I pushed very hard. Everything I said was not well received, but
                    the personal relationships were not affected. I was not exactly wheeling-dealing
                    on my own. I conferred with just about everyone in town, seeking advice on
                    Cyprus. I met with Dennis Ross, the U.S. Middle East negotiator, to learn from
                    his experiences. Tom Pickering, then Under Secretary of State for Political
                    Affairs, was a constant font of ideas, as was my friend, Marc Grossman,
                    Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs. Marc knew an enormous amount
                    about the region, particularly Turkey where he had served as DCM and then
                    ambassador. Sandy Berger, the President's National Security Advisor, was
                    particularly helpful and generous with his time. He was probably the most
                    creative in coming up with fresh ideas. I also met with the Washington
                    think-tank people and from time to time brought together previous ambassadors
                    and others having special expertise in the region such as Mort Abramowitz,
                    former ambassador to Turkey, and Nelson Ledsky who had represented the United
                    States in the negotiations on the 1992 Set of Ideas. I also met regularly on the
                    Hill with Senator Paul Sarbanes and Congressman Ben Gilman, Chairman of the
                    House International Relations Committee, both of whom had a strong interest in
                    Cyprus, mainly from the Greek perspective. Paul, whom I had worked with on other
                    issues, was the most forceful and respected voice on the Hill on Cyprus issues.
                    But there were others as well. Mike Dukakis called me from time to time, as did
                    John Brademas, the former president of NYU and longtime congressman from
                    Indiana, who also had strong ties to the American Greek community. In a word,
                    just about everybody who cared about Cyprus was on my call list.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOSES: Farouk Logoglu was Turkey's principal representative. Farouk and I
                    remained friends later during his four years as Turkey's ambassador to the
                    United States. Even though I didn't do what they wanted on all the issues, I
                    also got along well with the Greek American community — certainly with their
                    leadership, two individuals, Andy Athens whom I have known for years, and Andy
                    Manatos. I met regularly with Andy Manatos, less frequently with Andy Athens
                    because he was in Chicago. I met occasionally with representatives for the Greek
                    American community, as many as 30 to 100 at a time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you sort of compare your feeling about, I mean the
                        two major political, you might say ethnic groups in the United States are
                        the Greek American group and the Jewish American group. How did you feel,
                        you know having dealt with the Greek-Americans, they have some real blind
                        spots in my mind.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: They do. I dealt extensively with the Jewish American community when I was
                    in the White House. The American Greek community is a cake-walk compared with
                    the American Jewish community which had a far more activist, energetic and
                    stronger leadership. By comparison, the American Greek community seemed almost
                    languid, repeating the same mantra year after year. The issue was not life or
                    death, survival or extinction in Greek eyes, but correcting an historic wrong
                    for which the Greek Cypriots were not wholly blameless.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well I suppose the Greek-American community only had one
                        real issue.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: That was Cyprus. But one or two organizations. The Jewish community in the
                    United States has Israel and a lot of other issues as well. As the saying goes,
                    there are more Jewish organizations than American Jews, and their views are all
                    over the lot, from hard-liners to peaceniks. Much more difficult. And it was
                    harder still because I was Jewish. Those that didn't agree with me saw me as a
                    traitor, a turncoat or whatever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course you were in a way, I am not sure how things
                        stood at the time you took over, but you know the separate issue seemed to
                        revolve around two men who I think went to school together, Clerides and
                        Denktash.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>MOSES: No, they didn't go to school together. Clerides is older than Denktash,
                    but, under the British, they had both practiced law on Cyprus. Clerides was a
                    defense counsel; Denktash represented the Queen. He was a prosecutor. Clerides
                    had studied law at the Inns of Court in London. Denktash's legal education was
                    on Cyprus, not London. He was less of a Britishphile than Clerides. Clerides
                    served in the British Army in the Second World War. So there were differences,
                    but they had known each other a long time. They would refer to each other as “my
                    friend Rauf” or “my friend Glafkos.” But they weren't really friends. They had
                    very different views. Later, President Clinton told President Sezer of Turkey
                    that the Cyprus problem was a problem between Clerides and Denktash. He said,
                    “If those people disappeared, the problem would go away.” There was some truth
                    to it. Denktash was more than just suspicious. He was opposed to a resolution
                    other than on his own terms, and they changed constantly. His goal was a
                    separate Turkish Cypriot state. Clerides was much more flexible, more
                    forthcoming, easier to deal with — not entirely reliable, in the sense that he
                    was not able to deliver without first having to test the political waters, even
                    among his own political leadership, whom he brought to the negotiations from
                    time to time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what were the issues as you saw them? Why were we in
                        it, and what were we trying to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: The division on Cyprus had the potential to spill into warfare. Turkey and
                    Greece were both members of NATO, and the Cyprus Conflict could have
                    destabilized the Eastern Mediterranean. Our interest was to prevent this from
                    happening. There was also a political imperative, or near imperative. The
                    Greek-American community was pushing very hard in the Congress and with the
                    Administration to resolve the issue. They saw the Turkish intervention in '74 as
                    an invasion of Cyprus, and saw Turkey as the party at fault, rarely
                    acknowledging that it came about in reaction to a Greek Cypriot movement to
                    unify Cyprus with Greece. The government in Athens was a right wing junta.
                    George Grivas and other Greek Cypriots were chomping for unification. Bishop
                    Makarios had been deposed as Cyprus's president. There was chaos and the Turkish
                    Cypriots feared, I think wrongly, but there was real fear, that they would be
                    annihilated by the Greek Cypriots. People like Rauf Denktash saw it as the
                    opportunity for Turkish forces to intervene, divide the island and set up a
                    separate Turkish state, which is what he had wanted all along. So that was the
                    situation. There had been talks at various times since '74, in Switzerland and
                    elsewhere, largely UN supported, that didn't result in movement. Denktash kept
                    raising the stakes. Initially, the talks were about reunification without
                    conditions. Later Denktash insisted that reunification be based on a bi-zonal,
                    bi-communal federation. Then Denktash moved from “federation” to “federated”
                    with two autonomous member states, a Greek Cypriot member state and a Turkish
                    Cypriot member state, which meant to him that before negotiating an agreement on
                    reunification, there had to be recognition of the legitimacy and sovereignty of
                    the Turkish Republic of North Cyprus, that had been declared in '83 and
                    recognized only by Turkey.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>The issues were territory, property, security and governmental structures. Over
                    the years, various ideas had been floated. The last meaningful negotiations had
                    taken place in '92, when the parties came close to agreement on a “Set of
                    Ideas.” But the momentum created ended when Clerides became president of Cyprus.
                    During the election campaign, he had opposed the Set of Ideas. I think he later
                    regretted this, and his regret was an impelling force in his resolve to settle
                    the matter while he was still in office. I served from September '99 to January
                    2001, some 17 months. During this period, we made considerable progress. We
                    persuaded Denktash and Clerides to come to New York to begin the negotiations.
                    This was a major breakthrough. These were proximity talks. The two didn't
                    negotiate directly but through the UN negotiator, Alvaro de Soto, who in turn
                    met daily with me, my British counterpart and our respective teams. This process
                    finally evolved in the spring of 2004 as the Annan Plan submitted for
                    referendum, approved by the Turkish Cypriots and turned down by the Greek
                    Cypriots, a turnabout from what had been expected a year, or even six months,
                    before. Turkey supported the Annan Plan, as did the government in Athens. But
                    the Cypriot government on the island which was then headed by President
                    Papandreou opposed it. The vote was 70 percent opposed on the Greek side, 65
                    percent in favor on the Turkish side.</p>
                <p>I had a central role in getting the talks started in '99. I spent an entire night
                    on the telephone urging Clerides, who was in Durban at a Commonwealth
                    Conference, to agree to a statement that had been negotiated a couple of months
                    before with the Turkish Government as the basis for convening the talks. After I
                    read to him a statement I wrote on the spot whereby President Clinton assured
                    him that the talks would be conducted on a basis consistent with previous UN
                    resolutions, he finally agreed. The day before on a telephone call with
                    Secretary Albright and me, he had agreed to come to New York for the talks, but
                    then changed his mind. So I had to start over again on a Saturday night. I was
                    able to persuade Clerides in the end. It was important that the two sides be
                    seen as engaging in at least proximity talks so that the Cyprus Conflict would
                    not be an excuse for the EU to delay further the beginning of accession talks
                    with Turkey. The EU breakthrough occurred in December 1999 at the Helsinki EU
                    Summit Communiqu�. The official communiqu� called for the resolution of the
                    Cypriot issue, but it did not make it a condition precedent to Turkey's
                    beginning accession talks.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>I met with Denktash and Clerides for ten days in December in New York leading up
                    to the EU Summit in Helsinki and again in February in Geneva. We were scheduled
                    to meet again that spring in Geneva, but Clerides had an operation for colon
                    cancer. This delayed the talks until September in New York. We later had another
                    long session in Geneva in November 2000, my last. We had come up with two
                    initiatives, both of which I authored and promoted. One was intended to deal
                    with Denktash's insistence that there be prior recognition of the sovereignty of
                    the TRNC as a condition to moving to meaningful negotiations on a final
                    agreement. I came up with language for Secretary General Annan to use which was
                    to the effect that the parties would be equal in the negotiations, and that any
                    final resolution would take into account the equal status of the parties.
                    Denktash saw that as an enormous victory. It was really intended to move
                    Denktash off his position on recognition of TRNC's sovereignty. He played it as
                    a big win, whereupon Clerides played it as a big loss, and withdrew from the
                    talks. I had to hold his hand, literally, in his suite in the Waldorf Towers,
                    before he announced he would continue the proximity talks.</p>
                <p>After the round in New York, we concluded that the talks were going nowhere. As a
                    result, I initiated the proposal that the Secretary General set forth his ideas
                    of what a final settlement might look like. We dubbed this the “Clinton
                    Proposal.” The senior Director for European Affairs in the National Security
                    Council, Tony Blinken, and I wrote the briefing paper for Clinton. He was
                    supposed to deliver it to Kofi Annan at a dinner in New York where they would be
                    sitting next to each other. The President said he had delivered it to Annan who
                    had indicated it was acceptable and he would proceed. However, Annan told me
                    when we met in Geneva in November that the President never raised the issue with
                    him. So who knows? We nevertheless decided to treat it as the “Clinton
                    Proposal.” It was fleshed out by De Soto and his team, then presented by Annan
                    to the parties the third week in November in Geneva. A few days later the
                    Turkish Cypriot side withdrew from the talks with the blessing of the Turkish
                    National Security Council. The Clinton Proposal was the excuse Denktash had been
                    looking for to withdraw from talks that were putting unwanted pressure on him.
                    Denktash went to Ankara to make his case. Both Prime Minister Ecevit and Foreign
                    Minister Cem supported him, so the talks ended. We certainly knew a Turkish
                    walk-out was a possibility but were willing to take the risk. If the Turkish
                    Cypriots were going to walk out in response to the Secretary General's 20 or
                    25-point paper setting forth what a final agreement might look like, we were not
                    going to make progress in the talks anyway. So we bearded the lion in his den.
                    The Turkish side came back later, but that was after I was no longer the
                    presidential envoy. There was no successor, which I believe was a mistake, but
                    the incoming Bush Administration downgraded the talks.</p>

                <p>MOSES: No, never. If I had thought that, I would not have taken the job. I was
                    always hopeful, not optimistic, but hopeful. There was passion on both sides. It
                    was necessary for the parties to get beyond passion. They still haven't and that
                    remains the problem. There are ways of dealing with the emotional aspects. I so
                    recommended to the State Department this week.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MOSES: No, it is not resolved. And what is important in my view and should be
                    important in our government's view is that the Cyprus Conflict may block
                    Turkey's EU accession. As I see it, there is no point in going back to the Annan
                    Plan which, as it finally evolved, was enormously complicated. I think the Annan
                    Plan should be put aside to give the parties time for their relations to evolve
                    on the ground through the movement of people and goods. We will not defuse the
                    problem by going back to the Annan Plan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What role did the Greek government play in all this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: No direct role. Foreign Minister Papandreou was supportive of what I was
                    trying to do. Athens was not nearly as hard-line as the Greek Cypriots. George's
                    larger strategy called for a rapprochement with Turkey generally. Cyprus was an
                    important part of this as were certain Aegean islands Turkey occupied and air
                    and ship traffic in the Aegean. In Papandreou's view, a stable, democratic
                    Turkey fully at peace with Greece, a member not just of NATO but also of the EU,
                    was first and foremost in Greece's interest. We were trying to do that. This
                    would protect Greece's eastern flank. It would benefit both countries if their
                    relations were fully normalized economically and politically. Turkey is an
                    enormous market. Greeks are good business people. There is a lot of business to
                    be done in Turkey and beyond. A stable pro-Western Turkey would be an important
                    link to influence Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and beyond.</p>

                        and the Bush II administration came in. What have you been doing since? I
                        mean has it been basically back to law?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: The law for sure. About the time I started working on Cyprus I joined my
                    former law partner, Gene Ludwig, the founder of Promontory Financial Group
                    (PFG), a fast-growing financial services company. I am vice chairman and chief
                    operating officer. This takes most of my time. PFG provides consulting services
                    worldwide and is also involved in developing proprietary products. It has two
                    funds, one a hedge fund, the other a conduit for financing receivables. It is a
                    challenging business, and I am very much involved. I also chair UN Watch in
                    Geneva and a college board in Newton, Massachusetts, and I write and
                    publish.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What college board?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MOSES: I chair the National Board at Hebrew College, Newton, Massachusetts. Its
                    students range from high school age through rabbinical training. I give some
                    time to that. I have remained active, certainly in the private sector. I would
                    like to be more active in the public sector, but I am not a fan of the Bush
                    Administration. I think Bush's foreign policy is a disaster. I don't know how we
                    can extricate ourselves from Iraq; it will not be pretty. Whatever evolves will
                    not be a functioning democracy, with three ethnic groups participating as
                    equals. We did not know what we were getting into and we certainly don't know
                    now how to get out. Iraq is one of the enormous mistakes of U.S. foreign policy,
                    driven largely by the president's fixation on Saddam Hussein without a real
                    sense of what Islam extremism is about, and how to defeat it. So I am not going
                    to be part of this administration, certainly by its choice. Meanwhile, I do
                    visit with officials in the White House and at State. I visited last week with
                    Dan Fried, Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs, to talk about
                    Cyprus. I have a meeting in two weeks with David Welch, our Assistant Secretary
                    of State for Near Eastern Affairs. I am meeting from time to time with John
                    Bolton, our UN Permanent Representative, in New York. So I stay involved. I do
                    write papers when asked. Dan and David are career foreign service officers; John
                    is not. But John worked for me at Covington &amp; Burling in the days of his
                    youth, so we have an acquaintanceship and friendship that extends over 30 years.
                    We don't see the world the same way, but we cooperate on issues of common
                    concern.</p>
