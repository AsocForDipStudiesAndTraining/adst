                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an interview with Jerome K. Holloway, known as
                        Jerry. This is being done in Williamsburg at a Society of Historians of
                        American Foreign Relations Conference. Jerry is, you might say, a target of
                        opportunity. We're going to discuss mainly his time in China in the early
                        post-war years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Jerry, give a little background, a little about your education and how you became
                    attracted to the Foreign Service. When were you born, by the way?</p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: 1923. And I was a naval officer in World War II. Actually, the Foreign
                    Service came up—after the war I was in command of an LST going—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: LST being for those who don't know, “large slow target”.
                        [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Large slow target. I had been on one that was sunk at Okinawa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Landing ship tank.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Yes, 326 feet. And we were going down to Panama, and I was trying to
                    refuel some minesweepers, YMSs, yard minesweepers, without any proper fueling
                    gear, and it was a very frustrating day. I went down and looked at my mail,
                    which had been piling up in San Francisco, and there was the application to take
                    the Foreign Service examination, and I thought anything's better than fueling
                    minesweepers.</p>
                <p>So I mailed the application from Panama, and that's how I got in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you had an interest in this? Where did you get your
                        education?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: I hadn't finished college when war came along, I was at Catholic
                    University. And I was interested in diplomatic history. I'd had a very good—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were from the Washington area, so you kind of knew
                        what it was about rather than somebody from Kiakok or someplace?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: But I had planned to go to law school, in fact. I had not intended to
                    go into the Foreign Service at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the thing proceed then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Well, I passed the examination and was appointed. I went back to
                    college and got a degree, because I had left before, during the war. And I was
                    appointed in June of '47, and assigned my first post at Rangoon in August.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you give us a little feeling for the people? Was
                        there a group with you that came in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you give a little feel for what type of people were
                        these who were coming into our early post-war Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: I was, frankly, extremely impressed, and wondered how I had been lucky
                    enough to get into that fast company. There were extremely bright fellows, all
                    had been in the military. In fact, the examination was only give in '46 to those
                    who had been in the military. I don't think it had been a conscience effort to
                    get a cross-section, but I think it was a cross-section of the United States.
                    Probably a predominance of Ivy Leaguers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it was not an old-boy group, would you say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There's nothing like the military experience, I think. I
                        mean, you go off in your different ways and you don't come back the same
                        person you were.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: That's right. No, it was a very heterogeneous group and it was actually
                    fast company.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of training did you get before you went
                        out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Extremely sketchy. The Foreign Service Institute was in its infancy.
                    And they really hadn't thought out the junior officer program. Years later, I
                    volunteered to take over the junior officer program, but I think I got assigned
                    to German affairs instead. [Laughter] But for that reason I thought that the
                    amount of training that we got, the amount of background that we got, was
                    sketchy and hardly adequate. In many cases, my fellow classmates knew more about
                    the subject than the fellow who was up there talking to us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in a sense, it was an amusing military transfer,
                        sort of like a “repo-depot”, where they were throwing infantry replacements
                        into the breech to fill it up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: We obviously were all going to separate posts, and we were just a pool
                    from which junior officers were to be drawn and sent out to their first post.
                    Which, in itself, is not a bad way of doing it. You know, “makee learn,” as they
                    say in China. It's not a bad way of doing it, get out there and get your feet
                    wet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your first post was what, Rangoon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Rangoon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You served there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: From the late summer of '47 until the spring of '49, when I went to
                    China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Rangoon when you got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Well, it was still a British colony. Independence had been promised,
                    and the agreement on it was signed in the summer of '47 between Prime Minister
                    Attlee and U Nu—Thakin Nu as he was called then—who was the successor of Aung
                    San. The week before I was assigned to Rangoon, the prime minister and the
                    entire cabinet were assassinated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, my God. You mean, sort of a local thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Well, it was a power struggle between those who had exercised what
                    political power the Burmese did exercise in pre-war Burma and those who came
                    after. Aung San and his group had originally been allies of the Japanese and
                    then they turned on the Japanese. The assassination, I have since discovered in
                    reading the papers of General Sir Hubert Ranz, who was the last British Governor
                    of Burma, his papers are in the India library on Black Flyers Road in London,
                    that British officers had sold the guns to the group that did the assassination.
                    So that the Burmese xenophobia was not without a certain amount of
                    foundation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were American interests in Burma at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: As far as I could piece it out, there were only two. One was, we wanted
                    to see Burma independent. If you recall, decolonization was a large part of our
                    World War II and post-World War II policy. And we even asked the British, at one
                    time, “Do you really intend to go through with this?” That was I guess our first
                    interest.Our second interest was already, I can remember people saying “Well, we
                    don't want a communist state on the Indian Ocean.” I never could quite
                    understand—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, that was sort of the word that went around.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: The distressing thing was that we really did have no policy, and we
                    followed a personnel policy that made us suspicious to the Burmese. You've
                    undoubtedly read that one of the big complaints which diplomatic historians
                    correctly make about the Foreign Service is that when the era of decolonization
                    came in, we had no one who was trained in languages or the cultures, because
                    these posts had all been outposts of the European nations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Burma was a particularly handy one because it was
                        English-speaking.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Saigon and Hanoi were French-speaking. And Batavia was Dutch-speaking,
                    Djakarta.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>So what we did was try to assign to Burma, except for another young officer and
                    I, he had been a paratrooper, first lieutenant, they tried to find people who
                    had some Burmese background. Well, this meant people who had been associated
                    with the missionaries, or it meant, in the case of one officer, he had been an
                    Eagle squadron pilot in the RAF, an American flying for the RAF, who they later
                    transferred to our Air Force, and served in Burma. Another officer had been a
                    colonel, or lieutenant colonel, who had developed a great affinity for one of
                    the tribal groups in northern Burma. One of the USIS officers was the widow of a
                    missionary. Our number-one economic and political officer had been a missionary
                    teacher at Judson College, which is an American Baptist mission college, part of
                    Rangoon University.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you're describing to me what I consider a remarkable
                        staff, knowing the Foreign Service personnel system. I mean, most of our
                        posts anywhere just don't have that effort. Why this effort for Burma?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Well, I suppose, one of the reasons, I suspect, was that the people
                    back on the desks, one of them Ed Dahl had been a business man in Burma before
                    the war, and the other one was John Katy of Ohio University, of course one of
                    the most eminent scholars on Burma. Unfortunately, it was a disaster.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: These people were associated with the Burmese of the pre-war power
                    elite, and there were very few of them. The group that had taken over, Aung San,
                    and then his successor Thakin Nu, were young, radical. As I said, they had sided
                    with the Japanese and then had switched back to the British. They looked upon
                    this staff as a bunch of Trojan horses. These were colonialists. These were
                    identified with the old order.</p>
                <p>And the place where it came up most ludicrously was after I had left. The Burmese
                    had nationalized the Irrawaddy Water Transport; that was, they ran the ships up
                    and down the Irrawaddy River and the Rangoon River. And the question of
                    compensation—the British owners wanted compensation. And in the compensation
                    hearings, the British were sort of quoting our expert on some things he had
                    written before the war on the Irrawaddy transport thing. We, in effect, became
                    involved, to the Burmese mind, in the politics of the tribes. As you know,
                    revolts broke out in Burma within three months of independence, and they're
                    still going on today, forty years later, the same revolts are going on. And it
                    seemed to the Burmese that we were dabbling in their affairs. We weren't!</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I suppose what you're doing is you're pointing out a
                        problem that often the expert, or the person who knows an area, becomes
                        fascinated with certain groups or certain things and they tend, even if
                        they're under the, now dubbed the Foreign Service officer, they keep going.
                        And I think tribal politics always gets—it's very easy to get enmeshed in
                        this and I mean, in a way we did this in Vietnam, where many of our people
                        got entranced with the Montagnards and also in Laos.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: This, for the same reason, the British were sort of entranced by the
                    Kachins, the Americans by the Karens. They were better fighters than the
                    Burmese, they were mountain people, much more hardy. There's a whole difference
                    between the military ethos of a rice-growing culture and that of a mountain
                    tribe.</p>
                <p>And also they became converts to Christianity. Let's face it, that was a large
                    factor. But the point was that I saw—and still think I see—as far as the Burmese
                    were concerned, we looked like we were setting up an embassy that was going to
                    be mainly interested in Karens and Kachins and was going to be a divisive force
                    in the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, of course, I know nothing about Burmese politics,
                        but I assume the rice-growing city folk looked down upon the tribal people
                        anyway, and so this is the equivalent of the 1920s group coming into
                        Washington and working with the blacks instead of the whites or
                        something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: The British favored the tribal groups, and they'd also protected them
                    from the Burmese. The Burmese themselves, or the Burmans, to give them their
                    correct title, they realized that they were taking more into their independent
                    country than they should, that they probably could not have—it was called the
                    union of Burma, meaning that all these tribal groups were encompassed in it, but
                    the antipathy between the tribal groups and the Burmans was so great that many
                    of the Burmese leaders themselves had second thoughts. But, and this is true,
                    very true, in Africa, in a decolonization situation, you have to get back the
                    colonial boundaries. In other words, you cannot give up anything. If the British
                    had these boundaries, then damn it all, these were the boundaries of—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But we're still following this policy in Africa,
                        absolutely refusing to support various separatist movements, despite
                        pressures from Europe and from other places.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: The one thing that's sacrosanct in Africa are those pre-war
                    boundaries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because otherwise you're talking about chaos.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Nobody did a thing about Idi Amin until he crossed one of those
                    boundaries.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well, who was the ambassador and what was his
                        operating style?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Well, here again this was unfortunate. He was a very astute old veteran
                    of the consular corps, J. Klahr Huddle. He was away for the first thirteen
                    months of his incumbency on the Kashmir Commission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was trying to resolve the Kashmir dispute, which is
                        still going between Pakistan and India.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: So he had no, he really had no—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, your deputy chief of mission—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: He had spent the war in Cape Town and Durban, he had no experience in
                    Southeast Asia. Or in Asia, period. Huddle saw the problems very clearly. For
                    instance, the National Geographic Society wanted to photograph an eclipse down
                    in the Tenasserim Peninsula, Mergui. It's very south, a long, thin peninsula
                    going down the side of the Siam. And the foreign office gave its permission.
                    Then it was withdrawn. I think that they expected we were putting some CIA
                    people into the group.</p>
                <p>Huddle very quickly organized a luncheon with the Rangoon University people and
                    got the thing changed into a joint Rangoon University-National Geographic
                    expedition, and the Burmese said, “Fine.” He knew his way around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Almost anything. I did the administrative work, I did the commercial
                    work, I did the consular work. What we were basically trying to do there, right
                    frankly, was to survive. We were buying property, because we had blocked rupees
                    from war-surplus things, and we were trying to buy a new office, buy housing.
                    Rangoon was not a very comfortable place after the war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I don't imagine it was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: And the rate of sickness was very high.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>Oh, I might mention we had one military interest, and that was in what was then
                    called the Army Air Transport Command wanted landing rights at Thingangyun
                    Airport, which is the airport outside of Rangoon, for their round-the-world
                    service. And the British had granted us those rights, and the Burmese had agreed
                    to honor them. In the event they weren't used very much at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see Burma getting ready for this neutralist,
                        isolationist turn?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Not really. I think they were proud of their independence, they were
                    proud of their sovereignty. They saw themselves as participating in world
                    affairs in a minor way. But once the trouble started with the tribal groups—and
                    as I said, they're going on forty years later—they began to withdraw. They had
                    no money to carry out really an active diplomatic policy.</p>
                <p>And of course, after I left, the crowning blow was our assistance to the Chinese
                    Nationalists who came into Burma. This was direct meddling. And these two
                    Chinese divisions couldn't handle the Chinese Communists, but they could handle
                    the Burmese Army.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were two divisions that retreated after the collapse
                        of the Chiang Kai-shek regime and moved into Burma, where they stayed after
                        the war.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Years. Some are still there, in the opium business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: That's when they cut off. The Burmese said they would take no more aid
                    from us. They were always slightly xenophobic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find dealing with the Burmese yourself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: They're a very charming people. And it's a country that one British
                    writer once said where it's always 3:00 on a Saturday afternoon. There's no
                    great pressure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now we might move to your next assignment, which was
                        Shanghai. This was when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: This was in the spring of '49.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Well, I was, frankly, exhilarated. Rangoon wasn't really all that
                    exciting a post, and here I was being thrown into one of the world's greatest
                    revolutions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe what the situation was at the point
                        when you set foot in China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: It was collapsing! The Nationalists were retreating everywhere. There
                    was some talk of making a stand at the Yangtze, or south of the Yangtze. But as
                    we later found out, the communists crossed the Yangtze with remarkably light
                    losses.</p>
                <p>There was, as you remember, the fight back at home was the China lobby. The
                    Republicans, having lost the '48 election, decided to win the Chinese revolution
                    instead. And there was tremendous pressure on the administration to do something
                    to save the Chinese Nationalists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was our consul general? Who was running it?
                        What was the staffing like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Well, the consul general was John Cabot, who, of course, had been
                    deputy chief of mission in Yugoslavia. And as you probably know, our long-range
                    policy, which was a very astute one, was to hope that Mao became a Tito, which,
                    of course, he became a Tito in spades eventually. So we were right. “We,” I mean
                    the United States was right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this feeling transmitted to you and others? I mean,
                        was he talking to you about Yugoslavia, or did you have much contact with
                        him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: No, relatively little contact with him. No, I don't ever recall. I was
                    so far down the totem pole that nobody, I guess, paid much attention to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How big was our staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Oh, it was huge. We had had one evacuation, but I think there were
                    still over a hundred Americans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: I was doing consular work at the first part. I was pulled into economic
                    work later. But the question was, what's going to happen? Here's Shanghai, one
                    of the world's largest cities, a very complex city. It was the biggest city in
                    the communist world, bigger than Moscow. How was this going to be run by these
                    people who had come out of caves in the northwest of China?</p>
                <p>I think we all made a mistake, the old China hands in particular, in thinking
                    that they couldn't run this, that they weren't sophisticated enough. Fortunately
                    for them, there was a very, very low level of economic activity. Because the
                    Nationalists claimed to have mined the Yangtze. No one ever found any of these
                    mines. And then, of course, they had a blockade, or port closing as they called
                    it—self-blockade, I guess you would call it in international law.</p>
                <p>So that economic activity slowed, and this made, I think, Shanghai easier to run
                    for the communists. They had many, many handicaps. They had a bias against
                    cities, as you probably know. They'd been out in the boondocks for ten years,
                    and they thought cities were sinkholes and cesspools.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, Shanghai was the sinkhole of sinkholes. I mean,
                        we still think of it in those terms. [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: And remember, extraterritoriality had only been given up in '43, and it
                    was only given up because the Japanese had thrown us all out of those cities!
                    [Laughter]</p>
                <p>But the general level of the competence of the communists, heck, was higher than
                    we expected. It was also a great relief once the city was captured, because
                    there was some law and order returned. The last days of the Nationalists were
                    pretty chaotic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing the last days of the
                        Nationalists?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Basically, putting signs up on American property, saying in Chinese and
                    English that this was an American-owned house. We were looking at it as a matter
                    of protecting American interests in China, which, of course, were extensive in
                    Shanghai. Americans owned houses, businesses, and banks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had these private Americans all left by that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: A great many had, but a great many had stayed. This was, of course, the
                    big question, where we split with the British and where the split was to
                    continue for years. Do you stay and try to do business with these people, or do
                    you declare them beyond the pale and get out?</p>
                <p>The British, who had never gotten along with the Nationalists as well as we had,
                    they thought the communists might work out. We thought otherwise. But as you
                    know, we were left there after the thing, after the capture, with the hope that
                    there might be some eventual development.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of instructions were you getting? In the first
                        place, we had rather strict immigration controls. So were we trying to do
                        anything to help Chinese Nationalists get out and go to the States, or was
                        this pretty much just—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: No, but the main effort in the visa side was with Russians and
                    particularly Central European—Germans, Austrians, Czechs, most of whom were
                    Jewish—who had come to China in the '30s, and now, of course, wanted out. This
                    was the main effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you under any standing instructions to be more
                        liberal? Because our rules were still pretty stringent.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: No, I think the American Joint Jewish Distribution Committee was very
                    active, and I think they managed to put a little pressure on Washington, and
                    Washington would then instruct us to issue this visa or that visa. But as far as
                    I could tell, not having anything to do with the visa business—thank God!—it was
                    a very, somewhat poignant—as many of these people had just escaped with their
                    lives from Hitler's Germany, and here they were about to be thrown back into
                    the, under a Communist regime. It was not a very happy situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the instructions? I mean, obviously at the time
                        when the Nationalists were fleeing, the communists were coming in. Did the
                        consul general call you together and say, “All right, batten down the
                        hatches, here we go!” or “We're going to do this”? How did the consulate
                        face this situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Well, I think we tried to put a good business-as-usual face on it as we
                    could. Except for one thing. And that was, we were not to, in effect, recognize
                    the Chinese communists by any official act. And they, by their token, said
                    “Well, you are no longer vice consuls or consuls. You are ex-vice consuls, or
                    ex-consuls. You have no authority.” Of course, we never were accredited to any
                    government; we were still accredited to the Nationalist government.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>Now, this kind of situation can go on, as the British did in Taiwan. They kept a
                    consulate open there for ten years after they had opened an embassy in Peking on
                    the grounds of the consul is assigned to a provincial authority, not to national
                    authorities. So that had there been any political will to reach an agreement
                    with the Chinese communists, we had plenty of time. Shanghai fell in May—May
                    24th.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of 1949.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: '49. And the People's Republic was proclaimed on October 1, '49. So we
                    had plenty of time to make up our minds whether we wanted to recognize them. We
                    chose not to, as you know; we were going to let the dust settle, as Dean Acheson
                    said. It was all, of course, tied up with the China lobby politics in the United
                    States, and it became politically impossible for Truman to take that step.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for this battle back in the
                        States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: No. We saw very few newspapers. The English-language papers in China
                    were very careful about what they printed. We relied on the Voice of America and
                    the BBC. But I don't think we had any idea about the virulence of the China
                    lobby fight.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Although you officially weren't there, what was your view,
                        as you were going through the streets of Shanghai?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Well, first of all, as I said, a certain amount of relief that law and
                    order had been restored. The Chinese Communist soldiers never bothered anyone.
                    They occasionally were helpful. I can remember being out New Year's Eve with a
                    Russian girl, and we were both in evening dress. We went to a party at the
                    British Country Club. And afterwards she wanted to say hello to her father, who
                    was out at the Soviet Club. And we took a pedicab out there. And when we were
                    leaving—it was about 2:00 in the morning—the fellow was obviously—the girl spoke
                    Chinese, I didn't—the fellow was obviously, literally going to take us for a
                    ride. And a communist soldier came over and told him, “Look, you take these
                    people where they want to go, and no nonsense.” Now, maybe he thought we were
                    Soviets coming out of the Soviet Club. But there were many incidents like that.
                    They were there, they were country boys. But they were told to keep law and
                    order and they did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Consulates deal with the local government, and at this
                        point, of course, the local government was communist.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: We, at that time, required consular invoices for goods shipped to the
                    United States. That was one of my jobs before I was put in the economic section.
                    Well, the communists had taken a certain amount of tungsten and hair and Tung
                    oil and all that, and they wanted to fulfill the old Nationalist contracts,
                    state trading companies. Well, they sent somebody over to get a consular invoice
                    on this shipment. Well, they paid the two dollars and fifty cents, and we put
                    the consular invoice on it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You weren't going under any sort of harassment, to put
                        pressure on you, at least at the beginning?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Not at that time. Now, there were problems. We had some labor problems.
                    The Navy had not paid off some Sikh guards, and they locked us in the consulate
                    one day. But that was eventually solved.</p>
                <p>It got a little dicey when the Nationalists started air raids on Shanghai. These
                    were American planes, American bombs, American gasoline. They were B-24s; that's
                    a fairly potent plane. And the Nationalist Air Force, which had never shown any
                    capacity for accurate bombing in the fighting, suddenly became crack bombers,
                    bombardiers! They hit the—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a suspicion that this was somebody else flying
                        the planes? Were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: No. I'm fairly convinced that they were not. Just the Nationalist Air
                    Force chose to—not to make a pun—to be above the fight, as far as the communists
                    were concerned. But they were certainly—they hit the American power plant in
                    Shanghai. American Foreign Power had a plant at Riverside, a big plant. They
                    knocked out the French power plant, which meant there was no light or heat in
                    Shanghai in the winter. That, I think, had to create a problem.</p>
                <p>In October of '49, we had not responded to Mao's call for recognition. And in
                    retrospect, that was a mistake.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If you had Americans there and all, somebody must have
                        gotten in jail. I'm speaking as an old consular man.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>R. HOLLOWAY: Yeah, one of our vice consuls, Bill Olive. The day of the Chinese
                    Communist Victory Parade, which I think was July 7, '49. Very impressive parade.
                    He got arrested for going down a one-way street. There was some altercation. It
                    wasn't altogether clear that he acted with all the discretion he might have, and
                    they threw him in the poky and roughed him up. But then they released him the
                    next day.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there wasn't a matter of someone being in jail, and the
                        consul general, or somebody, have to go to the authorities, “I want access
                        to him or her,” or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: No, we had no problems like that. As you know, the Nationalist blockade
                    was run by Isbrandtsen. American ships were coming into Shanghai. Isbrandtsen
                    was running the Flying Cloud—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Isbrandtsen being a shipping line?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: A shipping line, yes. Sir John Franklin, the Flying Independence. And
                    these were fired on and hit and put on fire by the Chinese Nationalists outside
                    of—more outside of Shanghai. And our Navy would do nothing to help them.
                    Isbrandtsen and Acheson got into a newspaper war, taking ads out, insulting each
                    other. And in the end, Acheson got the Coast Guard to, in effect, say that the
                    masters were hazarding their ships by going into Shanghai, and if they went in
                    they might lose their ticket. And the Department said quite—it's now been
                    published in Foreign Relations—that we would take no action which would lessen
                    the effect of the Nationalist blockade of Shanghai. So we were taking sides by
                    then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Things were beginning to develop. How did this play out in
                        Shanghai and on the consulate there? We were helping the Nationalists and we
                        were not recognizing this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Well, the final act came when the Peking authorities attempted to
                    requisition French, British, Dutch and American property, which had been turned
                    over as a consequence of the Boxer conventions at the turn of the century, for
                    military barracks. And they wanted them back. We claimed they were American
                    property and that they were confiscating American government property. And if
                    they were going to do this, we were going to withdraw our consuls from China.
                    Now, frankly, the political sophistication that came up with that kind of an
                    argument is pretty low. The British, Dutch, and French figured a way to finesse
                    it. We chose to make a stand on that issue, and Acheson was a lawyer, and he
                    fought a good legal case. But it was a very bad political case. On the other
                    hand, given our backing of the Nationalists, it was obvious there was nothing
                    for us to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you feeling that what you were doing was drying up? I
                        mean, the invoices were going down?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: No, all that was ended. That was when I was switched to the economic
                    section and then it became very interesting watching what the Chinese Communists
                    were doing, particularly their attempts to stop inflation.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you do that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: You had access to all the commodity reports. We had our Chinese staff
                    with all the newspapers being published. Prices were there. We were interpreting
                    the Chinese Communists regulations for banking, for carrying on of export-import
                    business. It was a whole new game, and you had to stay up with it. For instance,
                    they introduced something called the parity deposit unit, which is sort of a
                    commodity dollar. And they linked wages to an interest rate, to the price of
                    four commodities: rice, cloth, coal, and firewood—briquettes. And this worked. I
                    later found out that the commodity dollar had been advanced as an idea in the
                    United States, back in the Depression. But where the Chinese Communists got the
                    idea, I don't know. The Hungarians had a tax that at one time that did this. But
                    there ability to control inflation was impressive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously, you were reporting on sort of factual
                        things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: They allowed us to keep our radio going. We had two Navy chiefs and a
                    warrant officer running our radio. We had no problem communication-wise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Those who were reporting on political developments, were
                        they beginning to get worried about the problem that later became to the old
                        China hands, “Who lost China”, and all that? I mean, were you feeling any
                        pressure? Was there any, “I'm not going to report this”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Not that I know of, not that I was aware of. I was very impressed with
                    the Chinese-language officers in our political section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Sabin Chase was the senior one, who had been around for a long time in
                    China. Doug Forman was one of the younger officers. These fellows were very
                    smart. And at that time, I don't think they felt any pressures whatsoever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The consular general as a unit, did you get called
                        together from time to time to sort of brief you in where we're going, and
                        what you're doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: What happened was that, in July-August, Leighton Stewart was
                    transferred back. He was the ambassador. At that time we had a large safety
                    evacuation, and the only staff that was left, I think, was seven American
                    officers. And that was the group that was to ride it out. So by that time, we
                    were down to the bare bones. Walter McConaughy became consul general. He had
                    been the deputy to John Cabot. And there were just very few officers left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were one of those?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: I was one of those who stayed, yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, had the Angus Ward thing happened up at Mukden?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Mukden, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it was the tradition then was to get rid of all
                        the married men, wasn't it, in times of trouble? I know, as an aside, when
                        all hell broke lose in Palestine, when it broke, they got all the married
                        officers out and sent all the single officers in. I mean, that's how we
                        dealt with things in those days, and I guess you were—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: I was single.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or at least that, or you had a girlfriend on the side
                        [Laughter]. So this was one reason why you were—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: I think that was one of the reasons I was sent there and one of the
                    reasons I was kept there. I mean, I was cheap, I was expendable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was very much an attitude at the time. A married man
                        was a very movable commodity. Did you sort of keep a bag packed at that
                        time, with the idea of, “They're going to do it us at some point”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: All of the old China hands kept telling us, “It's going to be just like
                    it was under the Japanese when Pearl Harbor came along. They're going to scoop
                    you all up in the bag and you're going to be in the wardroom jail,” or something
                    like that. And everybody kept one bag that he could grab at the last moment.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Continued reporting. We were then working very hard on the question of
                    American businessmen who wanted to get out. And of course, as you know, the
                    Communists squeezed them in some very, very elegant ways with taxes, or wage
                    claims, or alleged pre-war deposits. Labor troubles. I found myself going around
                    under instructions almost every day, to go see the fellow from Northwest
                    Airlines and the fellow from Chase Bank, and what was the situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were we telling them to get the hell out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: We never really did until we were ordered out. Then we really felt that
                    they should go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When were you ordered out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: In February of '50, We didn't get out until April or May of '50.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But this was not the Chinese telling you to go. This was

                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: No, this was the State Department withdrawing us. And of course, we
                    couldn't get out through Shanghai. We had to go up through Tientsin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you travel around anywhere prior to this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: No.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Shanghai?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: There were no restrictions on that. I had no problems with that. But
                    you couldn't take the train to Hong Kong for the weekend or anything like
                    that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have contact yourself with Chinese officials? I
                        mean, one can survive quite well without this in a way for a long time, and
                        most work of consulates, although it's a credit to them, we really operate
                        with the business community, and with the individuals.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Individuals, the missionaries, business community. We didn't have any
                    tourists, thank God. We had a few newspapermen and, of course we had the
                    resident American business community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the missionaries? What was your impression of
                        the American missionaries and how did you all deal with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: You have to distinguish in the missionary movement between the
                    headquarters group, let's say, in Shanghai, and the missionaries out in the
                    field. And they were two different breeds of cats. The missionaries in Shanghai,
                    the headquarters, were pretty sophisticated, politically astute people, who were
                    well aware of the power they had behind them in Washington. The missionaries in
                    the field tended to be good-hearted, somewhat naive, but certainly men of good
                    will, who were genuinely shocked. I talked to a lot of them when they came into
                    Shanghai, after they lost their churches, and the Chinese had turned on them.
                    They were quite shocked. I remember one doctor saying he was going back and go
                    help, go to work for the UMW, the United Mine Workers. They needed doctors.
                    “I'll treat Americans now. I won't treat anymore Chinese.” And there was a
                    profound disillusionment.</p>
                <p>The Catholics were a little different. I knew Bishop Walsh, who, of course,
                    stayed for twenty-one years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. In jail, mostly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: They had no families, of course, and they looked upon it as just a
                    cross to bear, if I could put it that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we trying to get the missionaries out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Yes. But after we were leaving, we pointed out that we could no longer
                    protect them. Not that we could protect them very much when we were there. And
                    we advised Americans to leave China. Obviously, some businessmen stayed. And in
                    the case of one banker, Bill Orchard of American Express, he stayed for three or
                    four years before he could get out. But Chase and National City kept on
                    functioning to a limited extent. Many of these men, of course, this was their
                    lives. They didn't have an institution like the State Department to go back to
                    which would send you out to another job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are a movable thing, so we can observe these things
                        with a certain amount of objectivity. How did it come about that you left
                        then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Well, we wanted to bring a ship into Shanghai. There were all sorts of
                    problems about that, because, again, the Nationalist blockade, which had by that
                    time been dissipated somewhat by the appearance, frankly, of Soviet fighter
                    planes, and had chased off the Nationalist bombers, which was a great relief.
                    This is something that's happened afterward. I mean, the Soviets have had to
                    help their allies out with fighter planes in more than one place. And pilots. We
                    were trying to bring the General Gordon of the American President Lines into
                    Shanghai, and the State Department was going to charter it and take everybody
                    out. And they just never could get permission from the Communists, or could
                    solve the problem of whether the harbor was mined. It wasn't. The Chinese
                    Nationalists had used this as a ploy in Changsha in 1930. They had said that
                    they had mined the Yangtze. So we took the train to Tientsin, and got out
                    through Tientsin.</p>

                <p>HOLLOWAY: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was just a move?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Until the last couple of days, we had our radio and our coding
                    facilities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting instructions that were trickling down to
                        you from the Department of State about how—was it kind of business as usual
                        and you were left on your own? Or was there any attempt to sort of fine-tune
                        from the State Department what we were doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: No. I got the impression—again, I was very low on the totem pole—and
                    the impression was confirmed when I got back to Washington, the State Department
                    in the China desk was in a state of shock, and they just didn't know what to do.
                    They had people in a half a dozen posts in China, and they just had to get them
                    out. The amount of guidance they were getting from the Secretary or the
                    President was minimal, because the administration was under fairly heavy fire
                    from the China lobby.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your attitude towards the situation in China when
                        you left? I mean, personally.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: My own personal view was that this was one of the great events of
                    history. I mean, good, bad, or indifferent, whatever it's outcome was going to
                    be, I would have liked to have stayed around a little longer and watched it.

                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: I think the younger officers would just as soon stayed around to see
                    what happened. Obviously, the older, more mature fellow with family interests or
                    career interests, something like that, they thought it was probably time to get
                    out. It probably was time to get out! After all, the Korean War started in June
                    of '50.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Well, obviously the people in Chinese affairs, who didn't seem
                    particularly interested in my experiences, as I said, I had a feeling that they
                    were kind of shattered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was 1950?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: This is just before the Korean War. And I was ticketed to go to Hong
                    Kong, to continue my China reporting, the economic reporting, which I'd been
                    doing, and was told by a senior officer in personnel that it might not be a bad
                    idea if I gave China a slip for the next couple of years. He thought it might be
                    uncomfortable. Of course, he was right. He suggested I go to Europe and pick up
                    another language and then take a look at the situation, which is precisely what
                    I did.</p>
                <p>I went to Bremen for two years as a political officer, learned German, developed
                    a liking for the country and its history, and went on, served in German affairs
                    in the Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, back to his advice, was this sparked by the

                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, very definitely?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: I'm sure this is what he had in mind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You hadn't felt it, but this was just a word of
                        warning?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Again, I was just small fry. I had no idea of what was to come. Later
                    on it did hit me in a strange way. But what I did was took his advice, had two
                    nice years in Europe, and then went to Hong Kong and stayed five years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But what you're talking about is an institutional response
                        to a situation. In other words, here's a senior officer telling a junior
                        officer, who probably has no particular stake, but saying it's best for some
                        of our officers to get away, get themselves somewhat removed from the
                        situation, rather than trying to develop an expertise. This is saying to
                        cool it for a while.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: I think that that's what he was telling me. As I said, I felt no
                    pressure on this at all. I was never interviewed by security or anything like
                    that. This is spring of '50. The loyalty program had been in existence since '46
                    or '47, the Truman program, and that had been no problem. When I was in Hong
                    Kong, of course, that was the years of the Dulles administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would like now to skip Germany.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Yeah, you've got thousands of people who have served in Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. What was the situation? You went to Hong Kong in
                        1952?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing and what was the situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: The situation was that you had a China reporting unit in the consulate
                    general in Hong Kong. It was, for the most part, made up of people who had
                    served in China and in Communist China. I had the highest respect for the
                    fellows who were in it. They were great fellows. It was about my best post. We
                    played tennis, golf, squash, hiking. Beer was cheap. It was just—everything was
                    cheap. Hong Kong was a bit confining, but not all that confining. And everyone
                    seemed to me to have a real interest in China and what was going on in China.
                    And it was a very professional group. Q: Who was the consul general then?</p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: When I first went, it was Julian Harrington. And he was succeeded by
                    Everett Drumright. We talked about Drumright. As I said, the China reporting, I
                    remember a fellow named Dick McCarthy started the translations of the China
                    press, which had become an essential tool for anyone doing scholarship or
                    research on Communist China. We had certain jobs to do. We were running the
                    export control program on China. One officer, Bob Eller, was following the
                    Americans who were trapped in China, were trying to get out. There were certain
                    sub-specialties, but by and large, we were focused on—we were the eyes and ears
                    of the government for China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: I was doing economic work, which I had been doing in Shanghai. It was
                    during that period that the security apparatus seemed to me to be operating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're speaking about the American concern about anybody
                        having dealt with China, whether they were a security risk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: That's right. I'll show you the sort of clumsy thing they did. The
                    security officer would come around and start asking me about a fellow I'd served
                    with in Shanghai, and what did he do in Shanghai and all that sort of thing. And
                    then the next day, he'd go to that fellow, who was working in say the political
                    section, and say, “Now, you served with Jerry Holloway in Shanghai. What did he
                    do there? What was his ideology? Did he have any Chinese girlfriends or anything
                    like that?” It was very clumsy, but enough to make things uneasy. And there were
                    some incidents that were not very pretty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you describe any?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Well, one fellow was asked to take a lie-detector test when he went
                    back on leave, although I think that was the military that insisted on that.
                    There seemed to be—I wouldn't say an attempt to set us against each other, but
                    Big Brother was looking over your shoulder in a way that he didn't used to. See,
                    I was there in '52 to '57, and that was a bad period.</p>
                <p>In the end, we were all cleared, no problem or anything like that, but it left a
                    sour taste.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were obviously all part of the reporting unit, both on
                        the economic side, which is yours, but on the political side. Did you have

                        about how you wrote these reports so it didn't sound like “Gee, they've come
                        up with a good new idea in economics”? This wouldn't sit very well in
                        Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Don't say that they're doing too well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean this was part of the ethos, or whatever it is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: And for instance, there was this organization called ECAFA, the
                    Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, which was a U.N. subsidiary. It
                    puts out an annual economic report on Asia. The State Department arranged so
                    that we had a veto. We went over it in draft, to take out anything too favorable
                    to the People's Republic. As you know, our policy was, as Walter Robertson, the
                    assistant secretary expressed it, to keep pressure on the mainland in the hope
                    that a revolt would ensue there, which we or the Nationalists could take
                    advantage. Dulles spoke quite openly. You can read it in Ridgeway's memoirs, of
                    how to invade China through Hainan, up thorough Korea. This was part of the
                    keeping the Li Mi and the Chinese Nationalist Divisions in Burma resupplied.</p>
                <p>It was our aim—we were hoping for the overthrow of the Chinese Communist
                    government, and to suggest that this government was fairly permanent was to fly
                    in the face of policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So although it wasn't explicit—it was implicit—you had the
                        feeling that you were watching your reporting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: It was easier on the economic side. On the political side, I think you
                    weren't going to do any speculative pieces.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One can read, as we say in the United States, the tea
                        leaves. [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Yes.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Despite this, did you find the morale good? Was it an
                        intellectually lively group of people you were dealing with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Yes. One of the problems in Hong Kong was that the consular section was
                    under a tremendous workload. You had 25,000 Chinese claiming American
                    citizenship, that they had to deal with. And you had the refugee relief program.
                    Those people really did work very, very hard, and without, as you know from
                    consular service, not a great deal of thanks. It was a tough job, and it sort of
                    divided the consular general into two sections: the consular section with this
                    horrendous workload, and the political and economic, which was a fairly nice
                    job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Almost an ivory-tower type of situation, as compared to
                        the working stiffs. I might add for the record, that these 25,000 Chinese
                        claiming American citizenship, many of these were fraudulent. They were fake
                        documents, and they were coming from various towns in and around
                        Canton.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: They were coached. It was just one gigantic fraud.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They used to have hit squads of our people who would break
                        into their houses with the Hong Kong police to grab their kochi books,
                        telling which village they lived in and all this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Where the school was—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where the school was. It was very elaborate.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: The best story, though, were the Canadians, who required that you have
                    no amoebic dysentery. No amoebas. Which required you were required to submit a
                    clean stool. There was a place in Hong Kong that guaranteed a clean stool.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They had stool producers, yes. Somebody at one point
                        figured that there were very few Chinese women at the time, and each one of
                        them had to have produced—I think this was before the 1906 San Francisco
                        earthquake—each one would have had to produce something like 200 children or
                        something like that, in order to produce the number of claimants to American
                        citizenship.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: You mention the San Francisco earthquake. These Chinese knew every town
                    in the West where the courthouse had burned town and there would be no records!
                    [Laughter] “Oh, I'm from so and so, Montana, 1923.”</p>
                <p>“Oh, that burned down. We don't have any records.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. [Laughter] Did you get any instructions from the
                        consul general, bringing you together? Did you have weekly meetings or
                        something, where you would sort of chew over the China situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Yes, particularly with Drumright, who, of course, had served in China,
                    served in Chinese affairs. Drumright was very right wing, very conservative, and
                    was a strong believer in Robertson's policies. But he was also intellectually
                    interested in the problems. He had no sympathy for the Chinese communists, but
                    he was certainly not prepared to say they don't exist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the thrust of your feelings from '52 to '57,
                        about the survivability of—were you, as a group, convinced that this outfit
                        was here to say? Or that the Nationalists are going to—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: No. Whatever was going to happen in Communist China, I think there
                    wasn't one of us who had any illusions about the Nationalists. Even those who
                    served in Taipei. They weren't going back to the mainland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling about the Nationalists? You were
                        getting obviously, pretty well second- hand. But the other people, what was
                        the general feeling about perception of the Nationalists at this
                        period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: That they had not improved a great deal over their performance on the
                    mainland. Now, this was not held by many of the top folks, particularly the
                    ambassador in Taipei. He was in our staff meeting, visiting Hong Kong, telling
                    us that, “Oh, our relations with the Nationalists are fine. Everything is
                    great.” And one of the clerks came in and called him out. There was a message
                    that the Nationalists had just broken into his embassy and, among other things,
                    had dropped the safe on his car!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was after an incident of—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: An Air Force sergeant, named Reynolds, was acquitted of murdering a
                    Chinese. And the ambassador was there telling us—</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is ambassador Rankin.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Rankin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, Carl Rankin.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Carl Rankin. That this was all going to pass and blow over! [Laughter]
                    And at that moment, his embassy was on fire!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the staff meeting, was anybody saying, “Well, this is
                        all very good, Mr. Ambassador, but it looks like the regime is here to
                        stay”? There was a certain keeping one's head down?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: No, nobody was going to tell him—we weren't going to say the
                    Nationalists were hopeless. But we were telling him that things were better on
                    the mainland than perhaps our propaganda was making them out to be.</p>
                <p>Now, you've got to realize that we were fooled, too. In '57, there was a bad
                    famine in China and thousands died. We had no inkling of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because you were relying on papers and broadcasts.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: The British would interview Hong Kong, the Hong Kong police would
                    interview Chinese refugees. We were allowed to interview non-Chinese, who were
                    still coming out—that was the division of labor—but the British made available
                    their reports. But this was very low-level stuff; as you know, these were mostly
                    from Guangdong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah, which is the Canton area, the traditional—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: The traditional hinterland of Hong Kong. The foreigners were more
                    interesting, particularly the White Russians, most of whom spoke Chinese and had
                    gotten some fairly good insights. We were hearing that the Chinese and the
                    communists and the Soviet advisors were not getting along from '53 on. They
                    would detail arguments in this factory or that factory, where the Soviets said
                    “Do it that way,” and the Chinese said—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Soviets weren't there en masse at that point? Or were
                        they?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Yes, in '53, '54, '55 they—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you view the Soviets as a great monolithic brotherhood
                        with the communists at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: No, no. As I mentioned earlier, our original policy was very
                    sophisticated. We say that Mao was going to be a Tito. And this was done at the
                    very highest levels in Washington. And it's been published in papers. Afterward,
                    that's '49, you get into the mid-'50s, you had to start asking yourself,
                    “Haven't we pushed the Chinese into the Soviet arms?” But we certainly did think
                    of them as monolithic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you didn't see, in your reporting and the others, any
                        sort of rift coming between the Soviets and . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: No, except for these reports that the Soviet advisors couldn't get
                    along with the Chinese. Now this turns out to be indicative of much deeper
                    disagreements.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you just quickly summarize where you went
                        afterwards, so the reader can get an idea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLLOWAY: Well, I decided that Chinese affairs was a dead end. And in '57, the
                    Department sent me to the University of Michigan. Spent a year and got a
                    Master's degree in East Asian Affairs; went to Japanese language school in
                    Tokyo, was assigned to the embassy in Tokyo, then was consul and principal
                    officer in Fukuoka. Went back to Washington, was in charge of INR, on charge of
                    Ceylon, India and Nepal. Was then switched over to German affairs when the wall
                    was built in August of '61. And stayed in German affairs and European affairs
                    for another three years. Then went, as counselor of political affairs, to
                    Stockholm and spent four years there. Came back and spent a year at Harvard at
                    the Center for International Affairs at Harvard. Went down to Washington as
                    Director of Regional Affairs for East Asia. Then went out and spent four years
                    as consul general in Osaka. Then came back to the War College as the State
                    Department advisor to the Naval War College.</p>
                <p>My wife died, I retired and stayed on at the Naval War College. Been there for
                    fifteen years now.</p>
