                <p>Interviewed by: Gordon W. Evans </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: October 4, 1988</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sitting in the Princeton Club. It is 11:20 on Tuesday,
                        October 4, 1988, here in New York City. I am Gordon W. Evans, a Foreign
                        Service officer, and I have the privilege today to interview the Honorable
                        Shelby Cullom Davis, who was Ambassador to Switzerland from 1969 to
                        1975.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Mr. Ambassador, may I start with a focus on how you, in fact, became involved in
                    foreign affairs? You come from a very rich background in terms of your
                    educational experiences. Could you give us some insight as to what influenced
                    you to spend this time in Switzerland as ambassador of the United States?</p>
                <p>DAVIS: I had been interested in foreign affairs during my four years at
                    Princeton, and each summer I went to Europe, once to England, actually bicycled
                    through England, stayed at Oxford, then to Germany the next year, bicycled alone
                    in Germany. Then the next year, I went to Russia with five other Princetonians,
                    and this was 1929. Very few people went to Russia in those days. We had a very
                    interesting time, the normal things—Leningrad, Moscow, and Kiev, then Yalta.
                    Actually, we went to Yalta, you see, because that was a very famous name because
                    of the war.</p>
                <p>The next year, 1930, I went to Geneva as the representative of my college, which
                    was Princeton, in what was set up as a kind of little League of Nations. The
                    Rockefeller family were very generous about this, because I think Professor
                    Zimmern of Oxford, who was the great internationalist of the day, thought it
                    would be a wonderful thing if the young people could take part in a kind of
                    League of Nations, and only one, just as one from each country is a delegate,
                    one from each university. There was just one from Oxford, one from Cambridge,
                    and then one from someplace in the Philippines, and so on. It is very fortunate
                    that I happened to be chosen, although I don't know that there was all that much
                    competition to be the representative.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>But my wife-to-be happened to be at that place, my wife Kathryn. We hadn't met,
                    but she had been the previous summer in Russia, too, with her sister, going into
                    Swanetia by horseback. This is because the great anthropologist of the day,
                    Professor Leslie White, wanted to have a little group, but he was trying to see
                    where the American Indians came from, and there was a theory that they came out
                    of the mountains in Russia, the Urals. So the fact that she had been in Russia
                    the summer before and I had, too, when in 1929 virtually no one went to Russia,
                    was one bond between us. We were married about a half-year later, in time to go
                    to Geneva.</p>
                <p>I've always had an interest, I think, in foreign affairs, dating from that time,
                    my college years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would be the impact of Columbia University and
                        International House? They both were institutions that you attended.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAVIS: They had a very important impact, because this was, of course, in 1930,
                    and no jobs at all were available. I wanted to be a journalist, but the World
                    went under, that is, the New York World, which was one of the great papers.
                    Unfortunately, they failed, and, of course, there were a lot of journalists
                    looking for jobs. But it was a very fortunate thing for me, because I took two
                    seminars which were very important, and one was with James T. Shotwell. We had a
                    seminar with Professor Shotwell twice a week at his house in upper Broadway, in
                    his apartment. James T. Shotwell was the author, of course, of the
                    Kellogg-Briand Pact, and he was very outstanding in those days. In a word, if
                    you studied under Shotwell, that was considered a very important thing. Of
                    course, the second one was Carlton Hayes, who later became our ambassador to
                    Spain a number of years later. Both very important people.</p>
                <p>When a job opened up at CBS, in December of 1931 I first learned of it. There was
                    a World Disarmament Conference going to meet in January 1932, and America was
                    going to participate, all the countries, because Japan moved into Manchuria in
                    the fall of 1931. Hitler was in the wings, not yet Chancellor. But people were
                    worried. Our State Department was, and others, England and so on. So they set up
                    this World Disarmament Conference. Mr. Frederick William Wile, who was the great
                    man in those days at Columbia Broadcasting, needed an assistant, and he
                    advertised for it. Consequently, the letters that I think Professor Shotwell and
                    Professor Hayes wrote on my behalf were really instrumental in getting me that
                    job. So I was consequently in Geneva about two years, broadcasting the World
                    Disarmament Conference, but also taking courses on the side, because they had
                    large periods when the conference wasn't meeting, and finally got a doctor's
                    degree from it, as did my wife.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's wonderful. She and you both at one stage or other
                        of your careers resided at International House.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>DAVIS: Yes, I did. Kathryn did also - but for only one semester. Her sister, who
                    had gone to Russia with her, came over to New York and they had an apartment
                    together. But I lived in International House, I would say, from September 1930
                    until early January 1932, when we left for Europe and were married just before
                    we left. That would be almost a year and a half. I prized my time at
                    International House very, very much indeed. That was a great international
                    experience, it really was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thank you, Mr. Ambassador. If one were to focus on the
                        principal element or principal actual focus of US policy in Switzerland
                        during the years you were accredited there, how would you summarize
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAVIS: I was named ambassador for a very simple reason, really, but the fact is,
                    I had known Bill Rogers, who was Secretary of State, because he had been a young
                    Dewey man. I had had the title of Economic Advisor to Thomas E. Dewey in the
                    1940 campaign for the presidency, and in 1944. Bill Rogers had been a young man
                    also, ringing doorbells. He was on the political side, and I was economic
                    advisor, which meant a speechwriter and a position writer. But he was getting
                    out the vote, which was probably more important.</p>
                <p>He knew about my interest in Switzerland, having been there, and they needed
                    someone who had some connections in Switzerland, which we, of course, had,
                    having gone to the university there had known a lot of people, and we had skied
                    there also, really every year since 1959. They had discovered, actually through
                    Bob Morgenthau, who was then the district attorney for the southern district of
                    New York, that the Mafia and other criminal elements were taking satchels of
                    money over to Switzerland on the new fast planes (the planes had become much
                    faster in the '60s) and deposited them in a bank which was kind of laundering
                    the money. Then it would be brought back, and they'd buy into legitimate
                    enterprises. So he had known that, and no one else had realized that this was
                    happening. He had taken it up with the State Department and, in particular, Bill
                    Rogers. Bill had known that I had lived in Switzerland and known a lot of people
                    there, and I think that's the reason I was selected for, I might say, six happy
                    years there. But it was really to look into the banking secrecy; that's why I
                    was chosen. That was my mission, actually, to get a treaty with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In terms of the focus on the banking secrecy and the
                        collaboration of the banking system of Switzerland with that of the United
                        States and other banks of the world, this was a principal focus of
                        yours.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>DAVIS: It was my real focus. It was considered a very important thing, the Mafia
                    sending over the money which they had earned illegally in America, and then
                    buying into legitimate enterprises. But of course, the Swiss themselves thought
                    the banking secrecy was a perfectly good idea, and I understood it, because in
                    1933, they passed their first banking secrecy law. Most people think that it
                    started in the Middle Ages. Not at all. The reason they passed it was because
                    under Hitler, who came into power in 1933, people, not only those of Jewish
                    faith, but liberals, in general, wanted to get out of Germany, but they didn't
                    feel that they could take a lot of money with them. They couldn't get the money
                    out of the banks. So they began taking holidays in Switzerland and bringing over
                    some money and depositing it in the bank. Hitler heard of it, or his henchmen
                    heard of it, and they began bribing people at a lower level in the Swiss banks
                    to tell them if this was happening and give the names. Of course, this is a very
                    bad thing. So the Swiss thought it was a perfectly legitimate thing to help
                    these distressed people in Germany, and I thought so, too. I think the fact that
                    I understood that, having lived in Switzerland in 1933 and 1934, helped me with
                    the Swiss, because they felt, “This fellow is sympathetic and he understands the
                    problem.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there corrections that the Swiss government was
                        prepared to make in terms of banking secrecy at that point in time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAVIS: Not at all at first. It took some time, actually, a lot of talking
                    together and getting to know them. They didn't want it touched, really, at
                    first. I could understand that. They used to have a saying, “Why don't you catch
                    your own crooks?” (Laughs) But then they finally realized that they didn't
                    really want to be having their own banks harboring money for crooks, so
                    eventually we worked out a treaty. It's called the Judicial Assistance Treaty,
                    which was passed unanimously in the Swiss Parliament and unanimously in our
                    Senate, by which they would give judicial assistance on application, that is, it
                    had to be a criminal, someone doing something that they shouldn't do, and then
                    they would help us. We had a lot of different versions of it, but this is what
                    finally took place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's fascinating. I realize in Switzerland you had the
                        American ambassador to the UN complex based in Geneva, and you were based in
                        Berne. What is that relationship? It's unique. To a certain extent, I guess
                        it would exist in the United States, but, of course, we do not have an
                        American ambassador to Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAVIS: Quite true. We had a very friendly relationship, but actually, this was a
                    separate part, that is, to Switzerland, whereas the ambassador in Geneva is the
                    ambassador to the United Nations. Then he also has duties with the other part of
                    our foreign policy there.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the liaison was such that he would keep you generally
                        informed, you were responsible for the relationship with . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAVIS: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In terms of various initiatives of the Nixon
                        Administration, I believe you went in July of 1969 to the post.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAVIS: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I believe the announcement was made on the 19th of April
                        1969.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAVIS: Yes, that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would be the Swiss reaction? In a formal policy
                        sense, did you make demarches or were you involved in any way in the opening
                        toward China? How was that very historic initiative perceived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAVIS: Really, we had, actually, nothing to do with that. It was other people on
                    that side of the world, but we were very interested. One thing that we did do,
                    which was a little different—this is toward Russia—when President Nixon, in the
                    fall of 1970, went to Romania, this is, of course, one of the satellite
                    countries, and was greeted, he gave a big speech at the airport. It was quite a
                    sensation for an American President to be going to one of the Iron Curtain
                    countries. I then thought, “Possibly he's shown the way. Perhaps we should very
                    quietly open up with the Russians.” I had been there, and my wife had been
                    there, and she had, by that time, written a book on Russia called The Soviets at
                    Geneva.</p>
                <p>We then, with the Department's approval, inaugurated luncheons with the top
                    Russians, the ambassador and four or five of his colleagues and four or five
                    other colleagues and myself, we had luncheons together every two months for some
                    time. We really built up a kind of friendship with them.</p>
                <p>But as far as China, we really had nothing to do with that; it was far away. But
                    we admired what was being done by Kissinger.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Another initiative was to begin the withdrawal from
                        Vietnam. Were there any demarches or direct involvements that you had with
                        the government of Switzerland during this critical period?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>DAVIS: Yes. We were asked by the Department to try to influence the Swiss
                    government so that they would take, say, the American side in Vietnam. But
                    unfortunately, they're neutrals, and they just didn't want to do it. I could
                    understand it, but we were disappointed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me move on, if I could, to Switzerland's principal
                        objectives as far as the US was concerned, from your perception during your
                        service there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAVIS: Oh, it's very friendly, extremely friendly. Of course, many Swiss have
                    come to the United States. I happen to be president of the American-Swiss
                    Association, and tomorrow night, Frank Carlucci, our Secretary of Defense, and
                    his wife are coming up here. He is of Swiss ancestry, and he's receiving an
                    award given every year for someone of Swiss ancestry who has succeeded here.
                    It's called the Friendship Award between Switzerland and America. So many very
                    friendly relationships. I can't think of any unfriendly part.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would there have been any aspect of the relationship
                        during the 1969-75 period, where the government called you over and
                        requested that you inform the President of the United States on a position
                        that they took?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAVIS: I can't think of any. No, they were very friendly and they still remain
                    good friends. No, I can't think of any. I think they admire the American
                    democracy. Of course, their Constitution was shaped a little bit on our
                    Constitution, too, two sides of Parliament, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think you may have touched on this earlier, Mr.
                        Ambassador, but if you were to zero in on one or two of your most
                        significant accomplishments, what would they be during that
                        ambassadorship?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAVIS: The real accomplishment was getting the Judicial Assistance Treaty,
                    because a lot of people were not for it at all, at first. “Catch your own
                    crooks.” Then when we talked a little bit further, they thought, “Well, why do
                    we have to sign a treaty? We'll just do it in an ad hoc business.” Then we had
                    to persuade them to sign a treaty which would be signed and be a much more
                    serious thing. But aside from that, I think that was what I was sent for.</p>
                <p>It was a friendly country, anyway, but we did a lot in traveling. We would be in
                    Geneva one night for dinner. We entertained a great deal in order to get to know
                    them better, and we had some of the Swiss saying, “You people know much more
                    than we do about our own population.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would say that is, from my experiences, diplomacy at its
                        best, which is to facilitate a host country, a people's understanding of
                        their own culture and richness.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>DAVIS: Yes. Yes, I think so, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because of what you've said, there may be nothing that we
                        can really capture here, but what was your greatest frustration during that
                        six-year period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAVIS: I suppose the slowness with which we got the Judicial Assistance Treaty. I
                    don't think they really wanted to do it at all, and I won't say any pressure was
                    applied, but we had to keep at it. I think they really thought they'd have an
                    informal understanding rather than passing Parliament or passing our Senate. But
                    I think that otherwise, it was a very friendly. People said, without knowing it,
                    of course, I didn't advertise what my mission was when I went there, and friends
                    said, “You'll come back a better skier than you are now. You'll have a great
                    time there,” without realizing I really had a mission. (Laughs)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The banking leadership undoubtedly would have been
                        hesitant and cautious. Where did you find the leadership within the power
                        structure of Switzerland to push on this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAVIS: They have, of course, the head of the banks, and he is a very key man.
                    Actually, I'm having luncheon with him next week. He's over here. He's now not
                    head of the bank; he's retired from that. I think they really had more
                    importance than the politicians themselves. I think they are the ones who made
                    the ultimate decision of, “Let's go along and do it with them.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you spent a fair amount of time cultivating him and
                        other of his colleagues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAVIS: Yes. Yes, I did, and we got Paul Volcker to come over. He was then
                    Assistant Secretary of the Treasury. They enjoyed meeting him, a fine fellow. He
                    came over a number of times. We would give dinners for him, and they all enjoyed
                    meeting him. Then, of course, Arthur Burns came over, whom they also liked very
                    much, a quiet man, but a very able fellow. So this was something we could, in a
                    sense, give the bankers in Switzerland, and they enjoyed it. That, I think,
                    helped.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In respect to that service from 1969 to 1975, and this
                        would be true of the entire embassy staff and your various posts throughout
                        the country, is there anything you would have done differently?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAVIS: I honestly don't think so. Maybe we could have gotten it a little quicker,
                    but at the same time, it was all very friendly, and I think if we had tried to
                    do it quicker or really tried to threaten them, I think that would have been the
                    wrong thing. No, I honestly don't think so.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DAVIS: Yes, I think so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Since this is central to your service there, let us review
                        the chronology. You arrived in July of 1969. When did you first make the
                        demarche to the government in regard to the banking?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAVIS: I would say about a half-year later. By that time, I had met all the
                    people in the government whom I didn't know. I knew some of the bankers, anyway,
                    because we had known them in Geneva, as well as in Zurich. I think it was about
                    a half-year later that I took it up with them in a serious vein, that this was
                    my mission. I wanted to cooperate with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have white papers? Did you have research documents
                        that made reference to the mutuality of concern that you left with them, or
                        was this largely verbal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAVIS: It was largely verbal, really. Verbal seemed to be a better way of doing
                    it, not something in black and white, at the beginning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think this a very, very important thing. This is the
                        centerpiece, really, of your ambassadorship.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAVIS: Yes, it was, definitely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a quantitative sense, in the process or procedural
                        sense, what evolved? If this was six months later, it would have been early
                        in 1970 that you brought this to their attention.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAVIS: Yes. That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The premier secret banking country of the world received
                        an ambassador who knew them well, and your mission was very clear. What then
                        was the next step after opening this as a concern with them? Who then took
                        the initiative? Did they or did you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>DAVIS: I think it was joint. They said, in effect, “Won't you bring over some of
                    your technicians from the Treasury Department, and we'll have technicians at a
                    lower level, and they can talk about it?” And that's really what started. Then
                    this went on. I was not present in those talks, and neither was the head of
                    departments there present. This happened, I would say, about four different
                    times before there finally was an agreement at a lower level, and then at a
                    higher level.</p>
                <p>Then Walter Stoessel, who was Under Secretary of State and a very fine fellow, a
                    wonderful man (we saw his wife in Maine just a week ago; he, of course, passed
                    on two years ago), an outstanding fellow, he then was brought over for the
                    signature, which took place, I think, in the spring of 1974.</p>
                <p>I came back a year later. We wanted to see how it would be received in Congress
                    and also there, and that's really the reason I stayed on, enjoying it, also.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Most certainly. In terms of your overall view of US
                        foreign policy towards Switzerland during this period, would you consider
                        that this policy, which is very complex, naturally, was effective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAVIS: Yes. Oh, I think so. It is being effective right now. They have the power
                    and have used it, and I could mention several examples. I don't have all the
                    names and so on, but there was someone who collected money from a lot of people,
                    misguided, and then he took them to some place in South America. All of them
                    eventually died. That's not a very clear story. I was out of the government
                    then. It was considered that he was doing something dishonest, and he had the
                    money in Swiss bank accounts. So the Department, then using this Judicial
                    Assistance Act, was able to find out that he actually was swindling these
                    people, and he was eventually, I think, put in prison, but, I'm sorry to say,
                    not after a number of them had died. It was a terrible scandal probably ten
                    years ago. I know that it's been used in other instances, as well, but that was
                    an outstanding one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In terms of the Foreign Service as we know it, this would
                        be both in the richness of your bringing your background with national
                        political movements, Governor Dewey on two occasions, and your other
                        services with the government, and being the father of a son and of a
                        daughter, would you have at any point in your relationship with them
                        recommended that they seriously consider the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAVIS: It never was actually brought up, but I would have certainly said so. I
                    think it's a wonderful career. We found the people we were working with in the
                    embassy really first-rate. We liked them all. Of course, they then go on to
                    other countries for another two or three years, but we think it's a great
                    service. I'm on the board of the Council of American Ambassadors, and I think
                    very highly indeed of the service. I do. I think it's a wonderful career.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A career officer often is asked by others, and it's quite
                        appropriate, and I hope you consider it a positive question, of the nature
                        and the difference and, in that sense, the richness of our foreign service
                        leadership, where some ambassadorial appointments are political and some are
                        career. Do you feel that the mix is about right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAVIS: That's more or less my feeling. In the very difficult posts, such as
                    Russia, of course, it's always a career man. They've had very good people there.
                    I think it is, it seems to me, about the right mix. At least I haven't heard
                    anything really much to the contrary. Perhaps the career people. But I think
                    they are perhaps used to it. England is political, generally Switzerland is,
                    too, but not always.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was your predecessor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAVIS: He was a newspaper publisher of the Washington Star. After myself, we had
                    a couple, one by the name of Davis, and he actually was a career man and a very
                    fine fellow. His father was head of the Technology Institute in Hoboken, a very
                    high level one. His name slips me right now, but he was a career man. Actually,
                    he had been in Chile, and he had been blamed—this was later on—for the fact that
                    the bombs killed Allende. They said he had something to do with that, falsely.
                    My Deputy Chief of Mission, Dick Vine, who is a career man, also later on became
                    ambassador to Switzerland. So Switzerland is kind of half and half. I think,
                    generally, the Court of St. James is a political appointment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In terms of the career service and coming into Switzerland
                        with a good view and grasp of the country, the culture, the mysteries that
                        make Switzerland so dynamic and effective in the world scene, did you feel
                        that more or less both your senior and junior officers that were on your
                        diplomatic team in Switzerland were well trained and effective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAVIS: I thought so. We both did, my wife, too, and the girls that they had
                    married, we thought they were all very good. They were, of course, performing
                    without any salaries, which I gather is in some question now. I'm not sure
                    exactly how far it's gone. We thought they were all very nice people and
                    effective people. Yes, we did. I can think of only one, and I'd prefer not to
                    mention his name, but Dick Vine and I both thought that this fellow wasn't quite
                    up to it. He was in the consul side, and eventually he got another job.
                    Otherwise, we were looking.</p>

                        you were right out in the Soviet Union, one of the few Americans that
                        happened to be there, fascinating, including Switzerland. But then you had
                        the service in your early '60s as ambassador to Switzerland. I have just had
                        reported to me from Mrs. Abby O'Neill (grand daughter of John D.
                        Rockefeller) who traveled with you in the Soviet Union in August and
                        September, that at 79, you're very hard to keep up with. What would you feel
                        are the three or four most significant achievements since 1975 that in part
                        were influenced by your ambassadorship to Switzerland?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAVIS: I suppose it's a continuing interest in problem countries. We continue to
                    go to Russia every second year. We were actually in Siberia last year, and we
                    went again this year. We hadn't been before. And also in China. We're doing that
                    every two or three years. Actually, this Council of American Ambassadors went
                    three years ago. We had people at a high level giving us briefings and all of
                    that. Of course, Japan, which is so successful, we've been going there. We go
                    every couple of years, as a matter of fact. We're quite interested in it. I
                    agree with the ambassador, Michael Mansfield, who had been the Majority Leader
                    of the Senate on the Democratic side. He gave us a wonderful briefing, a very
                    able fellow. I think he's over 80 now, and he's been there perhaps now ten
                    years. But he gave us the best briefing, I think. This was with the State
                    Department approval, about an hour and a half, more figures out of his head, but
                    he also ended with this. He said he thinks that the future belongs to the
                    Pacific ring, and I rather think that, too. But that he would say that to us, of
                    course, it was in-house, but I agreed with him. He made a remarkable showing, I
                    thought, Mansfield.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: An extraordinary man.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAVIS: I thought so. Excellent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He accompanied the Crowned Prince and Princess to the
                        United States in October.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAVIS: I didn't realize that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would presume that the Crowned Prince shortly will be
                        the new Emperor of Japan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAVIS: Properly so. I didn't realize that. Well, good for him. I think he's a
                    great fellow.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you have been describing the various experiences you've
                        had—and we've touched on only a few since 1975, over a period of 15
                        years—could I conclude that in one sense you were formally the ambassador
                        appointed by the United States in 1969-75, but you also have been very much
                        an ambassador, perhaps without portfolio, since that period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAVIS: We've done a lot of traveling. We don't really do it in the summer, but in
                    the early fall. We do regularly go to China and Russia and, of course, also
                    Japan en route to China. We know the others in the Far East, Singapore and so
                    on. But those, I think, are vital parts. I think if we want to hazard a guess at
                    what's going to happen in the world, I think it's a good idea to know those
                    places.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you feel that your greatest influence in this 15-year
                        period since 1975 has been on bringing insights from the Soviet Union and
                        China and Japan and other countries back to key opinion molders in the
                        United States, or in influencing the leadership that you have come into
                        contact with repeatedly in these countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAVIS: I think it's really the former. Actually, there is a certain reason. My
                    wife, Kathryn, who had written a book on Russia, she has been called upon by
                    women's clubs and the English-speaking Union, people like this, they're always
                    looking for speakers, and she is really a speaker herself on Russia, China, and
                    Switzerland, those three countries. So she likes to be kept up to date on it,
                    and that's one reason. That's being put to practical use, I think. She's
                    speaking at the Navigators of the World, something like that, at the Women's
                    National Republican Club next week on Russia and Siberia. So that is something
                    that's practical.</p>
                <p>I think mine is more of an interest. I think if you understand these countries,
                    it's fulfillment, I mean, if you're in finance, it's a good thing to understand.
                    I've never actually had any problem with the Russian people themselves. When we
                    go and travel, they smile and sometimes when you're having dinner and they're
                    having a big dinner, it must be some anniversary, they'll send over a bottle of
                    champagne to us, which is a very nice thing to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were recently with Ambassador Matlock in Moscow, who
                        is a Russian expert.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAVIS: Oh, yes. A great fellow, fine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you feel that the nature of our foreign policy and the
                        way it's exercised through our embassies, do you feel that that is as
                        effective as we could expect it at this point in time, both because of your
                        optic, as ambassador to Switzerland, but also from your personal knowledge,
                        with your frequent returns to the Soviet Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>DAVIS: It seems so to me, but, of course, I think the Secretary is very
                    important. He is getting around and doing a lot. Actually, this is between
                    ourselves, Frank Carlucci, our Secretary of Defense, has to go back at 9:00
                    o'clock because he's having a meeting with Shultz the next morning at 7:30. But
                    I think not only the ambassadors, but I think the overview of the State
                    Department itself is valuable. Of course, the ambassadors will use business
                    people and all where they can get their information. I know it perhaps can be
                    done better, but I honestly don't know in what way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you are very positive in terms of this experience, both
                        in Switzerland and in your lifetime.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAVIS: Oh, I think so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And would feel that our openings to the Soviet Union and
                        to China are very relevant.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAVIS: I think so. There are only a billion people in China. (Laughs) Only a
                    billion. I think we need good relations, and I just hope we'll get them with
                    Russia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me end by asking you, having done your early studies
                        in the field of economics and monetary policy, finance, and having seen the
                        birth of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, referred to as the
                        Bretton Woods Institutions, how do you feel about this system, particularly
                        with the experience in a very sophisticated banking environment in
                        Switzerland, how do you feel about the current relevance and effectiveness
                        of these institutions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DAVIS: I wish I could honestly answer that. Of course, I've thought that Bretton
                    Woods is better because we knew the value of each currency and all that, but I'm
                    not really sure that I am aware of all the various things, such as Jimmy Baker
                    has done this and all that. I feel the dollar probably was overpriced, but I
                    don't have the real feeling that I can make a sound judgment. I really don't. I
                    wish I could. It's more that I think we're all more comfortable under Bretton
                    Woods, but maybe, as Jimmy Baker said, he was the one who really got the dollar
                    down. In order to help our exports, maybe he was right. But I honestly don't
                    have a firm opinion on it. I wish I had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This tape will be in the Association for Diplomatic
                        Studies' Archives, and it will be reviewed by both graduate students,
                        professors in the field of diplomatic studies, and undoubtedly career and
                        non-career ambassadors. Would you like to leave them with any final judgment
                        in terms of the impact of your career on your life and the possibility of
                        anything they should keep in mind in considering a comparable career?</hi>

                <p>DAVIS: I think I and my wife feel our days in Switzerland were one of the
                    happiest we've had, and useful. I would say a career in the Foreign Service
                    would be a wonderful thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ambassador Davis, I would like to thank you ever so much
