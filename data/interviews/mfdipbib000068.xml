                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the first day of Spring 1995, March 21st. Nat and
                        I are old friends. This is an interview with Natale H. Bellocchi. I'm
                        Charles Stuart Kennedy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Nat, you were born in New York in 1926. Could you tell me a bit about your family
                    and where you grew up and about your background?</p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Well, up-state New York, a small town.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the name of the small town?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Little Falls, not a very difficult name but it is a part of the Mohawk
                    Valley, a series of small villages that had a lot of factories and were largely
                    people by immigrants. The towns in those days were divided by ethnic areas, even
                    the small ones. Little Falls in those days was a small town of maybe 13,000. I
                    think it's less than 8,000 now, and you had one area which was predominantly
                    Irish, the south side was Italian, the Polish lived in one area in the west, and
                    the Germans in another area, and the Ukrainians in yet another. It was
                    delightful because you could go to their ethnic grocery stores and get first
                    rate food. But after World War II that all disappeared and people inter-married
                    to such an extent that all of those ethnic divisions were lost. I went to the
                    public high school, (much to my parents' dismay I didn't want to go to the
                    Catholic school)but made up for it by being a good altar boy in the church. It
                    was largely an Italian immigrant church that we attended, we had plenty of
                    relatives all there in town. My father died at a pretty early age for me, I was
                    twelve years old. We were in the midst of the depression so the values one grows
                    up with are based very largely on austerity in terms of money, and the values
                    acquired at that age at that time. I lived there all through high school years.
                    When I graduated from high school, World War II being waged, 1944. I was
                    rejected for the draft and it was probably the greatest disappointment of my
                    life. You can't imagine now that in those days not to have been accepted in the
                    draft was just crushing, absolutely crushing. In fact, the result was that I
                    went to college at Georgia Tech because it was so far away. That was the
                    farthest I had ever gone from home. It took 36 hours to get there by train, and
                    I was in a completely different world in the south in those days.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did you pick Georgia Tech?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Cheap. It cost $56.00 a semester when I joined. It went up very fast
                    after the veterans started coming, the GI Bill, to something like $400 or $500,
                    which was an enormous sum. I worked, I would say, between 30 and 40 hours a
                    week. The family made a little contribution, but it was largely working your way
                    through.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you taking at Georgia Tech?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Industrial Management.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What pushed you towards that? Coming from an industrial
                        town, was that it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Well, I guess, and in those days being in engineering and management,
                    that is what you would study to get a good job. Essentially the purpose was
                    preparing for a job. I built up an interest in foreign commerce, not so much
                    foreign relations. I think I had in mind getting into a company that had
                    international operations. No particular reason other than I was interested.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you graduated in 1948?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: From college, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: I went to work for Burlington Mills, a textile company. I was hired
                    through the placement system of the school, and worked in Allentown,
                    Pennsylvania at one of their divisions. They used industrial engineers, taking
                    time studies on to make it more efficient. It didn't interest me all that much.
                    I went up pretty fast. I was still a bachelor, but I was still interested in
                    going abroad. But then the Korean War broke out. I had not been in the service,
                    so of course I was called up in the draft. I didn't tell a lie, I just didn't
                    say that I had been turned down, let's put it that way, because I was still
                    rankled by not having been in the service. I got passed. The heart murmur that
                    caused my previous rejection- well, they didn't seem to hear it. And it's quite
                    possible they didn't because these murmurs go up and down. So I passed the
                    physical, and got drafted and went to Ft. Dix, New Jersey, as a draftee. I
                    remember, 65% of our company in basic training, were college graduates. We were
                    being trained as infantry, and most of those people that I went to basic
                    training with went to Korea, and were caught up and pretty much wiped out by the
                    move of the Chinese into South Korea. But I had foolishly volunteered for
                    Officer Candidate School thinking, my gosh, I'm going to take another chance and
                    if they find I have a heart murmur I'll be out for good. But they didn't, and I
                    went through OCS at Ft. Benning, and spent a year out in California at a camp,
                    Leadership School, they called it, and then out to Korea in the infantry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When were you in Korea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: 1952—I think '52 and '53, and was assigned to a rifle platoon that had
                    just been wiped out on Baldy Hill, a famous place in the Korean War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you with a division, or a corps?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: The Second Division, the 23rd Infantry, A Company, and we were right
                    up on the front line. It was kind of dicey for a while, and then I went to
                    Regiment Headquarters after about six or eight months on the line. That's when
                    the current battle line had already been formed. I was lucky, that's all you can
                    say is that you're lucky. After another six months I came back. I was on board
                    the ship when the Armistice was signed, on the way back home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were, by the way, protecting me. I was in Seoul
                        listening to Russian broadcasts.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: We had an interpreter in case we captured prisoners. The Regiment had
                    one interpreter, and he spoke no Chinese, a little bit of Japanese which he
                    clearly learned in the bedrooms. So there was a dearth of Chinese speakers.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We had our own little war which was the war with the
                        Russian air force. Did you get discharged when you came back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Yes, I was discharged but in those days you were supposed to stay on
                    in the reserves for a certain number of years. I remember sitting at home and
                    deciding what to do, and I got this packet of field manuals about the recoilless
                    rifle. They said you have to keep up your reserve status by staying current. I
                    felt so disgusted, I took that bunch of books, wrapped them up, and sent them
                    back. I said I don't want ever to see one of these things again. Letters went
                    back and forth even after I got in the Foreign Service, but they finally gave up
                    on me and released me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were now eligible for the GI Bill. Did you use
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Yes, I used it. In fact, I didn't want to go back to the same job I
                    had. I was still interested in overseas, international work, so I went to
                    Georgetown.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: School of Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: School of Foreign Service. They had a one year course for people who
                    had already been through college, and I used the GI Bill and worked at Kramer's
                    Book Store in Washington part time, 20 hours a week, and got another degree in
                    one year. I then started to fill in applications, and quite frankly one was an
                    application to be a diplomatic courier. I really didn't have a clue what a
                    diplomatic...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you seen Tyrone Powell in the movie Diplomatic
                        Courier?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: I hadn't seen Tyrone Powell, but the work looked kind of interesting.
                    It said you flew around a lot...it didn't say you flew around, it said you
                    traveled a lot. So I filled in an application and kept bugging them so much that
                    they finally accepted me, and that's how I started in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you came in in '55, is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Came in in '55 as a courier, and went to Frankfurt first which was
                    then the base for European operations. I didn't know that one had to spend so
                    much time in airplanes. Airplanes in those days were not like the jets of today,
                    they were an adventure, let's put it that way, and often, especially in the low
                    countries, I wouldn't use a single ticket that I had been given when I started
                    the trip, getting on a train and whatever to do your rounds, and get back and
                    turn your tickets back in. I was there for a better part of a year, when I had
                    an accident. It was a bad year. Frank Irwin piled up in a Yugoslav airplane in
                    Vienna, very badly burned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He stood by the bags and protected them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: That's right, and I went to see him in the hospital on a later trip,
                    and then Louis Hebert had to jump off a plane in the New Delhi airport because
                    of something or other and hurt his back, but not too badly. I was on an airplane
                    between Tripoli and Athens, a C-47 at that time, and it didn't quite make it. We
                    tried to get back, but couldn't and took a dip in the water. I got the bag out
                    and got on a raft. We were soon seen by a British bomber out of Malta that
                    dropped flares to let us know that he had seen us, and we waited for the planes
                    to come. We all piled on one of these SA-16 rescue planes. I'll never forget
                    there were two of them and only one landed on the water. We all got out on that
                    one, which then was too heavy to take off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: SA-16 is an amphibian plane.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: A rescue plane, and he couldn't take off because it was too heavy, if
                    two of them had landed we could have taken off...we had to taxi all the way to
                    Libya. Then I got back to Wheelus airport where I'd been, that's where I started
                    from Wheelus Air Force Base, to pick up the bag to take to Athens. (We used to
                    have what we called details, and one was traveling from Athens to Turkey and
                    Israel into Cyprus and that area, and then back and forth, then over to Wheelus
                    to pick up the mail from Washington and back.) I had the bag with me when I got
                    off the plane at Wheelus, and the supervisor from Frankfurt had flown down
                    because they had heard that all was lost, and they had all the classified mail
                    to deal with. So he was down there when I got off the airplane. He looked at the
                    bag, and he said, “For heaven's sake, you got the mail all wet.” I realized I
                    wasn't going to get an awful lot of sympathy. It was a different world in those
                    days. I lost my suitcase and I wrote to the Department and said I had lost a
                    suit and a camera, etc., and it was the equivalent of about $120, which was a
                    lot of money in those days. I got a nice letter back saying, “There are private
                    insurance companies, you should have taken insurance.” I don't think you get
                    that now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you moved over to Manila?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: After that accident, I took a couple trips behind the Iron Curtain
                    which was very interesting in those days. But they needed some help out in the
                    Manila office and Louis Hebert and I were the last two on the totem pole. We
                    both got transferred out to Manila and I started to fly in the area. One of the
                    reasons I joined the courier service was trying to decide where it is I would
                    like to work internationally. I had read all the books on China that were so
                    popular...Pearl...</p>

                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: I was interested in Asia, and I was also interested in Eastern Europe
                    and I had seen a little of Eastern Europe on a couple of trips I had taken
                    before. But when I got transferred out to Manila, I took a KLM airplane I'll
                    never forget. It was a Constellation, and I got to Bangkok. Before getting to
                    Bangkok I started talking with the stewardess, who checked my passport and noted
                    that I did not have a visa for the Philippines. She said, “You've got to have a
                    visa to go into...American passports need a visa to go into the Philippines.” So
                    I got off the airplane in Bangkok and caught a cab to take me to the embassy.
                    Don Muang airport in those days was a long way away from urban Bangkok. It was a
                    narrow road. Inevitably you could see one or two cobras that had been run over
                    by a car or something. I got into Bangkok, but on the way, in the outskirts of
                    Bangkok, I caught the smells of the open sewers, and you know that reminded me
                    of Japan and Korea, and I said, “This is where I want to be.”</p>

                <p>BELLOCCHI: This is the area that I really like. It is not exactly the kind of
                    smell that you would normally be attracted to, but to me that was it, this is
                    the area that I really like. I got my visa, and eventually went to Manila and
                    traveled all over that area out of Manila. In those days we were in Manila, and
                    the Manila airport was fairly active but eventually the couriers had to move out
                    to Bangkok for a better airport.</p>

                <p>BELLOCCHI: About half because when you got to an embassy and had to stay
                    overnight,(embassy people were awfully nice in those days, especially because
                    one didn't have as many visitors given the air travel of those days was not that
                    easy)you'd get invited out to dinners, etc., and you really found it difficult
                    to carry on a long conversation. Yesterday you were in Thailand, and today
                    you're in Singapore, and tomorrow you're in Jakarta. So your conversations
                    actually were easier with air crews, or hotel people, or people you'd meet in a
                    hotel. The Foreign Service people were all caught up with how tough life is in
                    that particular place. But you knew you were in the Foreign Service. I was very
                    much a part of it, but as far as conversations and small talk, that was more
                    difficult.</p>

                    100-150 hours a month in those days. You'd get back, and you'd just get time to
                    turn your laundry in and pick up some clean laundry and get back on an airplane
                    because there was never enough people. We always had to recruit people from
                    other agencies to help us with the curtain countries, where we usually traveled
                    in pairs.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: After Manila I went back to Europe, incidentally, for a full two years
                    and traveled quite a bit behind the curtain. This was all in the ''50s in the
                    midst of the Cold War. First of all, you very quickly acquired a second sense. I
                    surprised myself, you know when you're being followed, and you have a second
                    sense. You know exactly when you've picked up a tail, we'd call it. In the Iron
                    Curtain countries they always assumed that couriers were spies, so we were
                    followed wherever we went, always. In some ways, if you didn't mind, it was fine
                    because it was safe, you never had to worry about anyone doing you in. And in
                    those days you carried your diplomatic passport and that really gave you a sense
                    of security, and it was security. But not now. At any rate, you traveled around
                    a lot in those countries. It was absolutely fascinating, it's an experience you
                    never can forget the rest of your life.</p>
                <p>Some of the foolish things one did. We used to love to try to lose our tail, for
                    example. That was kind of dangerous business, we shouldn't have been doing
                    it.</p>

                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: There were a couple, but not really very much. I think the countries
                    were always much more concerned about reciprocity, so they were treating us with
                    great care because they wanted their people to be treated with great care here
                    in the States. But places like Eastern Europe, we used to have a favorite place
                    in Budapest which was delightful even in those days. They used to have a gal
                    there that was always nosing up to the couriers. We all knew about it, and we
                    all talked about it and joked about it but nobody played around. That was
                    dangerous business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you move out of the courier service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: After the second time in Europe, I went back to Manila for a very
                    short time. I signed up and took the Foreign Service exam again, and passed the
                    written so I said I thought it would be good if I got into a regular job in the
                    Foreign Service to prepare myself for it. So they assigned me to Hong Kong, and
                    I directly transferred to Hong Kong as administrative officer assistant, or
                    something like that. I had taken the FSO written exam and passed, so then I went
                    to Washington for my orals. Another courier from Europe was having his orals and
                    was in Washington at the same time. I went in first, took the orals and they
                    wanted to know if I was interested in specializing or in general Foreign Service
                    work. Thinking that was the best, I sai“No, I would really like to specialize.
                    I've been in Asia and I really would like to get into Asia.” They said,
                    “Unfortunately we're not really looking for specialists now, we're looking for
                    generalists.” Whoops, there goes that one. But I actually felt better. I was
                    crushed for a while, but I went out and the next day a fellow courier took his
                    orals, and I told him what had happened, and said, “They're looking for
                    generalists, so you better be careful what you say.” They asked him the same
                    question, and he said, “General work in the Foreign Service.” And they said,
                    “Well, we're really look for specialists.” It was just that they had
                    over-recruited and they weren't taking anyone on. And then they stopped giving
                    the oral exam. The next year they didn't have it. So I had to wait actually two
                    more years before going through that process again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in Hong Kong? We're still in Hong Kong
                        during this period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: It was strictly administrative work, motor pool, housing. It was in
                    the 1959-60 time frame, so Hong Kong was a fascinating place to be.</p>

                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Holmes. His son became Assistant Secretary and did very well in the
                    Foreign Service. Holmes used to wear a high stiff collar. I can't remember
                    now...but it was a time when there were so many applicants for visas. People
                    were still called refugees in those days. Now they're illegal immigrants. Our
                    visa section used to have a Documents Verification Unit. They'd do all kinds of
                    things that were absolutely not lawful.</p>

                <p>BELLOCCHI: Getting into somebody's bedroom and looking at documents and things of
                    that nature. I mean it was done with the knowledge of the Hong Kong authorities,
                    of course. And to the credit of the Consul General, he put a stop to it and
                    disbanded that whole unit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We can come back to that. You had a chance to really focus
                        on China.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: In those days China was forbidden.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you within the group there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Oh yes. All the China language officers, I used to pal around with
                    quite a bit because in my assignments in Manila I used to have a Chinese
                    teacher...I started to learn Chinese there and it was mostly using writing
                    because I would be gone for most of the time. So whenever I got to Manila I'd
                    have a few lessons and she'd give me a whole bunch of assignments, but it all
                    had to do with the written Chinese. Then off I'd go for two or three weeks and
                    back. So I really got a head start on learning Chinese at that time. So, of
                    course, I was very fascinated with Hong Kong and all the China language officers
                    were very helpful. In fact, one of them even let me sit in on his lessons that
                    he took there at the Consulate General. The teacher now lives here in
                    Washington. I actually improved quite a bit on the spoken there in Hong Kong
                    because of that. I always had my eye on eventually learning Chinese, and after I
                    left Hong Kong and went to Washington, and passed the orals, I was assigned to
                    be the GSO in the embassy in Vientiane...In fact I had already been assigned as
                    the GSO in the embassy in Vientiane before returning to Washington. When I
                    passed the oral I said, “Now I'm an officer, am I going to get something
                    better?” And they said, “Sorry, too late.” So I had to go out there, but it was
                    delightful. I really enjoyed it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: It was delightful. We had no running water, so we had a water tank
                    truck that went around and delivered water to the houses that you lived in.
                    There was no electricity; everyone had their own little generator. There was a
                    place called Silver City where most of the staff people lived. It was built by
                    USAID. When I got there our military was still there, like MAAG-type of
                    military. AID had been bounced out before the talks that were going on with
                    Harriman in Geneva had begun.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: That's right. As a matter of fact when Kennedy was president he always
                    said “Laaos”. When Unger became ambassador, he would go back to Washington, and
                    the President usually called him in. The Ambassador told us he didn't have to
                    give the President any background about where Laos was, or what was going on. He
                    was very familiar with it. So he said it was really quite an experience. We were
                    in the center of everything. It was fascinating.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Oh no, I mean it was strictly a Cold War thing. We always used to say
                    Laos was not really a country, it was a figure of speech. It was not really the
                    kind of thing that you'd say; well, here's a clear territory, clear borders,
                    people that are under the control of the...none of that existed. It was very
                    much just an area.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Oh, sure. Up in the Plain de Jars, Kong Le and his troops were not
                    communists, but they were allies of those that were. Sure, they thought they
                    would be coming down and then moving into Thailand. It was the old domino theory
                    that they were still thinking of in those days. So I think that the ideas was
                    our JUSMAAG people were supporting those that were resisting the communist move
                    to the south.</p>

                <p>BELLOCCHI: Well, you're in a place like that, it's quite unusual, you do
                    everything for yourself. We built an addition on to the embassy all by
                    ourselves, all this kind of business. When it rained very hard you just rolled
                    up your pants and walked through the flood, and the secretaries kept right on
                    typing away with the water swirling all around them. It was a happy mission, a
                    very happy mission. Eventually the AID people started to come back as the
                    military left. For a while we were all alone, only about 30 of us in all Laos
                    when the military left. Then AID came in. They came in faster than the military
                    left. They really poured in. But it was a family thing. I remember we'd have
                    parties and Unger would come, taking a beer and downing the whole mug of beer at
                    one time. We'd have contests, and he'd join right in. It was a fun post.</p>

                <p>BELLOCCHI: I think peddling the pedicab was about the level of technology that
                    they had reached at that time. They may have improved after that, but at that
                    time, no. So we did everything ourselves, with our own people. It was
                    fascinating, I enjoyed it. If you take an interest in any post it doesn't matter
                    where you go, it can be a challenge.</p>

                <p>BELLOCCHI: No, still a bachelor. You'd go down to Bangkok, for example, that was
                    the big trip for us. It was at a time, you remember, during the Kennedy years
                    when there really was an attitude back here in Washington, administratively,
                    that the post should be given money and let them manage it and have them report
                    back. If they do their job, we'll fund them. That kind of flexibility made it
                    actually a lot of fun to be an administrator of those things. It was
                    challenging. We were able to accomplish an enormous amount.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you left there and what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: We got inspected while I was in Laos and only two of them dared to
                    come up from Bangkok. They inspected us at a time when it very fortuitously
                    rained very heavily so flood waters were all over the place. Our secretaries
                    were sitting at their desks typing away with water and lizards floating around
                    the water, and right within the building. I'm not talking about outside, and
                    they were very impressed with the way we kept everything going even in such a
                    bad time. So I at that time had just become an officer—I'd passed my Foreign
                    Service exam, I actually got sworn in in Laos by the DCM at that time, and they
                    said, “Well, you don't have any language on your paper. What are you going to do
                    about that?” So I said I would like to go to Chinese language; I'd been studying
                    it privately on my own even there in Laos. He asked me, “With a name like yours,
                    why not Italian? That would be the easiest way for you to get off the language
                    problem.” I said, “Yes, but if I studied Italian, I would only be able to be
                    assigned to one place and I'm interested in Asia.” So he said, “That's
                    reasonable.” And he recommended that I go to Taichung, and I did eventually get
                    the orders to go to Taichung.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Taichung being the...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: ...the language school on Taiwan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've got you there from about '63 to '65?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it's important to understand the type of people
                        who went to language school at that time. Could you talk about your class,
                        and how the training was, and its outlook?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: It was still at that time a carry-over of the old type of language
                    school where it was very important that you mix. You'd get located in a place
                    where there aren't many tourists and foreigners, so that you had to use your
                    language as much as possible. They had a small school, at one point there were
                    only six students and six teachers. It was always one-on-one, changing every
                    hour, no English spoken in the school. Every weekend was off with one of the
                    teachers to some village, or someplace else on the island where the teacher
                    would never never speak English. You had to order food, and get to the hotel,
                    and all this kind of business. So it was very intensive. We had six hours of
                    class a day, plus we were expected to put in at least two to three hours of
                    listening to tapes after that. They threw you into it no matter what. I had not
                    had a bit of the romanization they were using at that time, the Yale
                    romanization system. I'd studied my Chinese from characters because of the job I
                    had, and it was kind of tough adjusting to the new system. I never have really
                    learned much on romanization. I found it very difficult, but that didn't matter.
                    They just threw you in there and you had to do it. I think being that intensive,
                    and being isolated from foreigners, really was very very good. That's where I
                    think government was getting their money's worth because after all of that, and
                    going up to Taipei to the embassy, it was really only then that I began to think
                    in Chinese, and really felt comfortable speaking Chinese, even after that
                    intensive thing. So if it's less intensive I don't see how people can really get
                    as much out of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the officers who were getting trained with you?
                        What was their outlook towards China, and your outlook too? You had
                        Communist China, and you had Taiwan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: First of all there was a mix of people there. There were some
                    military, some USIA people, there could have been any number of other agencies
                    that had some people learning languages, and USIA people were focused more on
                    culture and that area because the vocabulary is quite different. But as far as
                    the attitude, that was still a time when Communist China was Red China, and the
                    concern mainly was, well, there weren't really very many places to go if you
                    were going to use the language except Southeast Asia, and that was only with the
                    overseas Chinese group. In fact most of those people didn't speak Mandarin, so
                    it was kind of limited. I think that everyone thought, well one day this is
                    going to be useful because one day maybe there would be something opening up out
                    there. But as far as attitude, China was Taiwan. That was the China that
                    everyone knew, and not always with great admiration. There was a lot of
                    criticism of the government of that day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From your observation at that time, can you characterize
                        the Kuomintang government on Taiwan.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Very good in terms of efficiency, the use of our AID money, very
                    impressive. Of course, very disarming always because they're always quick to
                    acknowledge, “Oh, we really appreciate all the help you're giving...” this type
                    of thing. They're very very good at this, and I think it's not a put-on, I think
                    maybe they are sincere. But there was also very much an awareness at that time
                    that it was a small group that was governing, a majority of people that weren't
                    really participating at all in the whole process. In fact, that was my major
                    emphasis when I went up to Taipei because I was assigned up there as the
                    assistant commercial attach�, and it was at a time when AID was just phasing
                    out. In fact they closed their doors in '65, and we had to look for export
                    opportunities. Before that we were dealing with government. So AID always dealt
                    with government only, and government always dealt with their state enterprises,
                    and companies that were more or less Mainlander run companies. And when I got up
                    there, they were saying we really had to start developing a market. Most of the
                    private sector is really Taiwanese, not Mainlander, and we didn't know anybody.
                    So I started a major effort, in fact I wrote a very large report ...I visited
                    almost every factory on that island, went all through that island visiting
                    factories, getting to know a lot of people, and then developing a huge list of
                    Taiwanese business men. Some of them very substantial, and we really started to
                    work on getting to know them better and developing export opportunities for
                    them. Again, you can make every job a fascinating job, and it was fascinating
                    for me.</p>

                <p>BELLOCCHI: '65 to '68.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the first place, was the attitude of the ruling people
                        who'd come over from the Mainland, sort of looking down on the
                        Taiwanese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Oh, yes, very much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sometimes these attitudes get picked up by the embassy
                        officers?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Well, to a certain extent because in those days, just say as an
                    example a political section...I can't remember how many officers were there, say
                    four or five anyway, they would always have one that had had three months extra
                    study in Taiwanese which, of course, meant he could say hello and goodbye maybe
                    at the most. But at least he focused on the Taiwanese community from the
                    political reporting standpoint. It wasn't given that much attention because all
                    the power was in the hands of mainlanders. So I think there was certainly
                    sufficient element of our people who were China oriented, to think that Chiang
                    Kai-shek and the Kuomintang and the rest of them were here temporarily and one
                    day they would return in some fashion back there to the mainland. But there was
                    also a lot of criticism of our dealings with the authorities. To be fair, that's
                    something that doesn't come easily for us, and we were well aware of the
                    inequities there. As time went on that grew, that is, the awareness that the
                    Taiwanese were really second class citizens in their own place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was our ambassador at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Admiral Wright, Jerauld Wright. I'll never forget Jerauld Wright. He
                    was only there for a short time. On my first assignment after arriving in the
                    embassy, a lawyer from Los Angeles had a trade complaint on some scrap iron.
                    Somehow or other $100,000 had changed hands, and the Los Angeles client was
                    claiming they hadn't received the scrap iron, while the local scrap iron dealer
                    claimed they had. The American lawyer came to the embassy for help and they sort
                    of hooked me, and said, “You go and help him.” So I was the translator, an
                    interpreter for a full week of this guy bargaining, and by the end of the week,
                    as usual, the fellow's foot was practically on the airplane going back to Los
                    Angeles before the final deal was struck for $40,000. And they agreed, and he
                    got a check for $40,000 there at the airport, and to this day I don't have any
                    idea who came out on that one. It seemed to me that maybe both of them came out,
                    I'm not sure. But unbeknownst to me, that lawyer, when he got back to Los
                    Angeles wrote a letter to Ambassador Wright to say how much he appreciated the
                    help this fellow Bellocchi gave, he was a superb interpreter. I didn't know
                    anything about this, but my boss from the Department of Commerce, a very
                    fine...he's still alive and lives out in Minnesota, wrote my OER, efficiency
                    report, and he showed it to me as they were supposed to do. Then he said, “While
                    you're reading this, I want to show you something that I didn't have the heart
                    to show you before.” This was months after...he pulled out of the center drawer,
                    this letter from this fellow in Los Angeles and all these fine things he said.
                    Scratched across the top of that letter, “I don't believe in complimenting an
                    officer for just doing his job.” Signed Jerauld Wright.</p>
                <p>So Wright was there at first, but then there was a hiatus...</p>

                        we're just about finished with your first time in Taipei after you became

                        up in case we didn't mention it last time. As you got into Chinese, and you
                        were on Taiwan, did the shadow of John Stuart Service and the old China
                        hands who were badly burned by McCarthy and the people on the right, did you
                        new China hands kind of look over your shoulder and think about that much or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: I don't think we thought about it at my level at that time. But you
                    certainly sensed that up in the higher levels where policy decisions were
                    actually being made, it was an element in the kind of decisions one was going to
                    be making to be sure one stayed out of trouble.</p>

                        by taking the language you had made a commitment. Did your cohorts sit
                        around and talk about this, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: I think in Taipei there was always...I guess among the liberal element
                    of our China types who thought we ought to make more contacts with the native
                    Taiwanese, that this was where all the people were and one day there would be a
                    democracy, and we ought to..., etc. And there were the other cautious ones
                    saying, our policy is with Chiang Kai-shek, and retake the Mainland, and all
                    that kind of business. And even though we knew it was patently ridiculous, that
                    Taiwan was not going to retake the Mainland in that sense, nobody really would
                    stand up and say, let's drop this fiction.</p>
                <p>It got to the point where...I remember a little incident when I was leaving
                    Taiwan, Fred Chien and Paul Chou, and one other from the North American section
                    of the Foreign Office in Taipei, had a little lunch together with a couple of us
                    from the embassy. At the time I think Fred was about the number three in the
                    North American section, he's now the Foreign Minister. We were kidding and the
                    inevitable question always came up, what's going to happen when the Gimo goes?
                    The Gimo was pretty old at that time. And Fred who wears glasses, sort of put
                    his glasses down toward the end of his nose, and said, “You mean if he goes.” We
                    all got a big kick out of that, but it was the sort of thing that demonstrated
                    that the was considered supreme by everyone, and everyone thought they had to
                    pay public obeisance to it, including us Americans. When I was down in Taichung
                    Ambassador Kirk was just leaving, he was Kennedy's ambassador to the ROC. He was
                    followed then by Jerauld Wright who just died recently.</p>

                <p>BELLOCCHI: Jerauld Wright was conservative, nothing could be better than Chiang
                    Kai-shek and his people, so one had to be a little careful on how one were
                    criticized the Taiwanese Chinese, to protect your own career I guess.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, absolutely. Well, Nat, you left Taipei in 1968, and
                        you went to Hong Kong. What were you doing in Hong Kong?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Oh, that was a great disappointment. I was sent there to the economic
                    section because, you know, like any Chinese language officer you're very anxious
                    to be a China watcher, and I was anxious to be more the mainstream Foreign
                    Service type, either economic or political. So I was delighted that I was going
                    into the Mainland economic section of the consulate. And no sooner had I gotten
                    there than the Department had apparently done some cutting of positions, and a
                    position was being cut out of the Mainland economic section, and since I was the
                    latest in I was going to be the first out. And they said they wanted me to be
                    the assistant commercial...it's not commercial attach� in Hong Kong, the
                    assistant chief. And I was just furious because I had been the assistant
                    commercial attach� up in Taipei, so I held out for being the chief, and got it.
                    I became the chief of the commercial section, and it was a disappointment for a
                    short time because I really did want to do some China watching. Especially
                    during the cultural revolution time when China watchers did innovative things
                    like trying to see where the pigs were coming from in Hong Kong today. That
                    would indicate whether or not there was something going on, where pigs normally
                    came from! But, in fact, it doesn't matter which job you take if you develop
                    interest in it. I started to get into the job of chief of the commercial unit,
                    and wound up with an accomplishment, I think, quite an accomplishment getting an
                    American Chamber of Commerce started in Hong Kong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean they didn't have one until then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: No, they didn't have one, and there was great resistance to it. One
                    from the policy standpoint. We didn't want to raise a high profile in Hong Kong.
                    I thought this was patently ridiculous because the Seventh Fleet used to park
                    ships down in the harbor every day. If we worried about profile, why weren't we
                    worried about all those war ships in the harbor. And then even in the American
                    business community in those days, a majority were those traders that had come
                    down from Shanghai, they were the old timers, and they operated by the seat of
                    their pants. They represented large corporations in America but they did their
                    business on a personal basis like everyone does in China as you know. And
                    American Chamber of Commerce, that was alien to their kind of thinking. They
                    were doing fine, thank you. But there were a lot of the new multinationals that
                    were starting to open up offices in Hong Kong. They were modern managers, and
                    they did want an American Chamber. So I argued the case that even during the
                    Cultural Revolution, the Hong Kong government was very much interested in
                    knowing what was the American business community was going to do. Were they
                    going to bug out? There was no mechanism to get a good survey quickly about what
                    the American business community was thinking. So I used that as an argument both
                    with Ed Martin who was then the Consul General in Hong Kong, and with the Hong
                    Kong government Secretary for Commerce and Industry. And they finally said okay,
                    as long as the Chamber didn't raise a high profile. The American business
                    community didn't want to make trouble, they wanted to do business. So I took a
                    poll of the American business community, and sure enough, a lot of people were
                    interested in a Chamber. So I convened a meeting down in the brand new Hilton
                    Hotel, it had just been built. Someone from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce was
                    passing through and I used that as a crutch to get this bunch together. I told
                    them, “I have done all the surveys, and this is what we find. But I'm with
                    government, and an American Chamber of Commerce is a business organization. If
                    you all, as businessmen, are interested, I certainly have a mimeograph machine,
                    and I'll help in any way, but its got to be you all that organize it.” And much
                    to my dismay, the first two or three businessmen that got up, big ones, were
                    saying they really didn't like the idea. And I thought, “Well, that was the end
                    of that exercise.” But then three of them got up, and volunteered to form a
                    committee to see what kind of opinion there was on getting the Chamber started,
                    and if there was a majority to get it started. Well, they already had the
                    majority because I had all the papers showing in the survey. That's what got it
                    started, and they moved on from there. It's become one of the largest AmChams
                    out in Asia. It has been growing every year since. So I was quite pleased with
                    that accomplishment. I also had another reason—the day of that meeting was also
                    the day I got married. In the morning I had the meeting, in the afternoon I got
                    married. So I always remember that particular...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time, you were there from '68 to '70, why would
                        one want a Chamber of Commerce?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: You have to know the atmosphere in those days. There was what was
                    called a Foreign Assets Officer out there, and this guy really took his job
                    seriously. There were not many Mainland Chinese stores in Hong Kong in those
                    days, but there were a few. And this guy would go down there and stand around to
                    see if any American tourist were buying things; that was then against the law.
                    You couldn't buy anything from Communist China in those days. But there was
                    more, I mean important restrictions. For example, U.S. oil company tankers, if
                    they bunkered in a Mainland port, were breaking the law. They were very upset
                    about those restraints, while all their European competitors were making all the
                    money. So when the AmCham opened, the Secretary of Commerce was passing through
                    Hong Kong and we used that occasion for the grand opening of the American
                    Chamber of Commerce on the top floor of the Hilton Hotel. Jack Wolfe, who was
                    the Caltex representative at that time, was the first president of the AmCham. I
                    remember the Foreign Assets Control fellow was there at that dinner, and Stans
                    was the Commerce Secretary. And Jack Wolfe gets up, and he gives his talk, and
                    boy, he hits Stans right between the eyes with this business of, why can't we
                    bunker our ships just like everyone else can bunker, and added all the other
                    constraints of the Foreign Assets Control. I thought the Foreign Assets Control
                    fellow was going to fall off his chair because this was his whole life. So it
                    demonstrated very quickly why have an American Chamber of Commerce. It was not
                    just because they wanted to have influence on the Hong Kong government, they
                    wanted to deal with their own government on some of these constraints as well.
                    And it worked, they got that thing changed eventually.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the business climate like in Hong Kong at the
                        time you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: This was in the ''70s when Hong Kong really started to take off with a
                    lot of industries. First of all, for American business, it was a transition from
                    the old seat of the pants Shanghai types who represented all these large
                    corporations, to the large corporations coming in with their own offices and
                    representing themselves. They had a professional managerial class coming in.
                    Then U.S. manufacturers were largely the early electronics producers, like
                    transistor radios, who were just beginning in those days to come to Hong Kong.
                    They hired all these little young gals out there by the hundreds putting these
                    tiny little things together. The growth of the American business community was
                    in that area at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you picking up the feeling of say the Hong Kong
                        business people more than the Chinese and the British about how they viewed
                        what was going in China, and how they viewed the future?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: It's funny, maybe its changed now, but in my time the Americans and
                    the British community weren't all that close. I mean it wasn't an adversarial
                    relationship, by no means, but they had their friends and we had ours, and there
                    really wasn't that much mix between the British community and ourselves. There
                    was much more mix with the Hong Kong Chinese than there was with the British.
                    There were a few exceptions, the political advisor in the government was a
                    Foreign Service type and we both knew professionally how to operate with each
                    other. But the rest, no. The colonials, the government, the view they had of the
                    Americans was that we were a little bit too strong. But the Chinese Hong Kong,
                    we got to know very very well indeed. You know, you make friends in Hong Kong
                    and they really are life-long friends. We still communicate with some of our
                    friends there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are they a breed apart, did you find?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: The last tour I had, it was not following this one that you're talking
                    about, I had a subsequent tour in Hong Kong when China was opened, and talking
                    with the Hong Kong Chinese business men, and the Chinese Chinese business men
                    from Mainland China, if you can call them that, and their respective thinking
                    were like two ships passing in the night. Really the mentality is totally
                    different. Now I think there's been a much stronger mixture since then, but yes,
                    they were a breed apart. They were optimistic about Hong Kong, no matter what
                    happened they always felt, stick it out. And they usually won out because things
                    got even better. Yes, very much a breed apart.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the view you were getting from our China
                        watchers? You were part of the consulate general there, the cultural
                        revolutions was in full swing, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: During that tour, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were we seeing it then, as what they were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Well, of course, it was sheer turmoil that was going on up there, but
                    in China, there was a constant search for little tidbits of information about
                    precisely what it was that was going on. The famous one is my colleagues
                    watching the pigs that were coming in from the Mainland, and saying these pigs
                    were coming from a different place than they used to come from, therefore there
                    must be some problem up in the original area. And that was the way we worked.
                    People would go down to the railroad station and look for Chinese newspapers
                    that maybe were left behind; and others that had contacts with tourist agencies
                    to get to one of the groups coming back from China to see if they could cull
                    some newspapers and magazines. That was the way we were trying to read what was
                    going on in China. It was for many a big mysterious place. Tourists would go out
                    to the border and look across the border—they used to pay for that, to just look
                    across the border to see China. Every day we'd walk past the Bank of China, as
                    the Consulate General was just up the hill from the Bank of China. It was a
                    mysterious place, and we used to see people go in and out of it, but nobody,
                    nobody ever saw the inside of it. It was quite different. Most of the people in
                    Hong Kong, let's face it, were refugees from Red China. You watched the change
                    in the flags that were flown on National Day. The first tour I had in Hong Kong
                    was around 1960. On double ten, the Nationalist Day, all of the flags were the
                    nationalist Chinese flags, and were all over the colony. But on October 1st, the
                    PRC day, you saw very few Chinese flags. Well, by the second tour in '68, that
                    was already beginning to change very substantially.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Hong Kongese were not looking towards Taiwan, but
                        looking towards...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: ...the outside world. It's a mystery. Singapore is the same. If you
                    get an analysis on China from Singapore, I always thought because they don't
                    really understand China that well. And Hong Kong was the same. And Taiwan, that
                    could have been on Mars as far as the people in Hong Kong were concerned. I
                    remember Herb Levin a few years before, had brought a cook down from Taiwan, and
                    he spoke Mandarin. They moved into an apartment, and wanted to get an air
                    conditioner set up. So they called some workers in while the cook was there. He
                    spoke Mandarin, and they up and walked out. They thought this guy is from
                    Mainland China and they didn't want anything to do with him. So someone from
                    Taiwan would come down and speak Mandarin, and the Kong people would assume he's
                    from the Mainland. They didn't think about Taiwan at all, it was just off their
                    radar scope. To a certain degree it's now changed, there are so many tourists
                    from Taiwan going into China through Hong Kong, and there's so much trade from
                    Taiwan going into Mainland China that more Hong Kong people do know that Taiwan
                    exists.</p>

                    were some, as I recall, there were demonstrations in which some of our officers
                    actually went out with the demonstrators. It was peaceful demonstration, they
                    weren't throwing eggs or anything. But that was appalling to many of us. God,
                    what is going on here? We're really falling apart. But nothing serious. But

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But was this thought about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: No. There was very little about it, there was always the fact that the
                    North Vietnamese were getting all this support from China, and both were
                    communists, therefore they had to be good friends. This type of thinking, not
                    unusual. I mean, there was a sign that we used in U.S. buildings in Vietnam that
                    said, we don't have 12 years of experience in Vietnam, we have one year
                    experience twelve times. Our people in South Vietnam, I think, were not
                    reporting that there was any real differences between communist China and
                    communist North Vietnam. I think only later did become clear that in fact that
                    was the case. But as long as the Chinese were feeding weapons to the north it
                    didn't really matter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any concern—again, I only speak about this at
                        the time, '68 to '70 period—that the bombings that we were doing, and the
                        various things, might drag China into the war?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: I'm sure there was. I didn't perceive them in the kind of work that I
                    was doing, but there must have been a concern about dragging China into it. I
                    think it was pretty clear China didn't have to come in, all they had to do was
                    feed weapons to the North Vietnamese. They didn't have to get involved
                    themselves. I didn't sense any hesitancy about it during my time there,
                    however.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back on the commercial side, where was our thrust at the
                        time? Were we trying to attract Americans to export to Hong Kong? Or were we
                        working almost the other side of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: That, inevitably, yes. We were trying to attract the U.S. exports. We
                    had catalogue shows, and things of that nature, to encourage American exports.
                    We had the World Trade Directories, or whatever it was called, all the different
                    things that Commerce usually has for these things. But we also were promoting
                    Hong Kong as a regional center for our multinationals. I remember writing a big
                    report on Hong Kong as a regional center. Taiwan is now boosting this sort of
                    thing, but in those days it was Hong Kong. I also wrote a comparison of Hong
                    Kong and Singapore as a regional operations center. And many of our companies
                    willy-nilly were using Hong Kong for that purpose for very pragmatic reasons. It
                    was practically a tax free place, a free port. So on paper they could do a lot
                    of business throughout Asia and take the profit in Hong Kong where the tax was
                    lowest. Of course, the countries in southeast Asia weren't terribly happy with
                    that kind of arrangement, but our companies were doing quite well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there concern during this period that the cultural
                        revolution might bring out mobs in the streets in Hong Kong?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Absolutely. The British were very concerned about things like the
                    riots that actually took place. You know they also had them long before in '56.
                    They had riots when there was a large fire in the refugee camps...they were
                    called refugees in those days, not illegal immigrants. They lived on the
                    hillsides. And then there were riots that dealt with the KMT boosters rioting
                    over something. So the British were always extremely concerned about security.
                    They had a big enough problem without having that sort of thing. So they were
                    quite concerned of losing control. When the riots took place during the cultural
                    revolution it was very serious. They even had to come down to the Americans and
                    said, they hoped the American businessmen would not leave. They must have had to
                    swallowing a lot of pride, but they were quite worried.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Hong Kong in 1970 and you were in the Department
                        for a short time, and then off to Vietnam.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Yes. I came here to take the economic course. I think it was a 22-week
                    economic course. And then didn't have any assignment. I can't remember whether I
                    was ever offered one. I must have been and didn't like it. But they were dying
                    for people to go to Vietnam, and they were getting trained in the same place
                    where the economic course was given. We'd just bought a house and I said, “Oh
                    boy, the mortgage payments were...” So I said, okay, and I volunteered for
                    Vietnam and they put us through this language training, which was a total waste
                    of time. For someone who is really committed, just like I had been for the
                    Chinese language, that's different. But if you're just going there to learn a
                    little bit about the language before you go off on an assignment, I really
                    didn't get very far in the language. But that didn't matter, off I went to
                    Vietnam very quickly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were in Vietnam from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: '70 to '72, and it was quite a shock.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: I was assigned first in the CORDS program for one year. I went up to
                    Da Nang, and then to a small place called Tam Key, which is sort of a wide place
                    in the Street Without Joy up there, in the northern part of South Vietnam. It
                    was a shock because I had been to Vietnam many times as a courier when the
                    French were still there. And the place that we were sent from once we got to
                    Saigon, was Da Nang. Da Nang had been called Tourane and it was a beautiful
                    little seashore village. Cathay Pacific Airplanes used to have to stop there on
                    their way to Bangkok from Hong Kong. In those days propeller craft had to stop
                    someplace; they couldn't go that far. It had been beautiful. And here I got out,
                    and oh dear. I mean there were American military people all over the place. The
                    first thing that happened, a bunch of kids came around, grabbed my watch and ran
                    off. I thought, oh my gosh, what has happened to this place?</p>
                <p>John Gunther Dean was then the sort of district director of CORDS up there in Da
                    Nang. I went in to see him before going down to my place of assignment in Tam
                    Key. The night before he had had a dinner for several Foreign Service people in
                    I Corps. When I left the next morning he said, “The only advice I can give you,
                    is that before you get on that little airplane (there was a little airplane to
                    take me down to Tam Key)take a good shot of cognac.” I thought, what in the
                    world is happening.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>It turned out it was quite a place. We had defenses all over the housing area to
                    protect ourselves. The area was controlled by the Viet Cong during the night,
                    and we had it during the day. If we wanted to go out to the boondocks, which I
                    did on many occasions, the only question was, are you sure you're going to be
                    able to get back before nightfall. It was quite an experience, I must say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this north of Da Nang?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Just south of Da Nang. There had been some problem with the Americal
                    Division whose base was on the coast. They had been pretty badly decimated.
                    Units were still going out to the Triple Canopy jungle, which was not too far
                    away, to set up outposts. Once you got away from the seacoast you got into that
                    business. Having been in the military, I had been in the army in Korea, the
                    state of our military there was appalling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was at its worst, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: They were half-dressed and ill-shaven, dirty and undisciplined. I mean
                    this was just unbelievable. You couldn't help but understand right away, why we
                    had to get out of there or we wouldn't have an army left. There were a lot of
                    things that happened during my time there. Of course, fighting still persisted
                    in our province. I had an occasion where...a little boy had just been orphaned
                    by the fact that some of our troops had been in and shot up the village. The
                    parents had been shot as Viet Cong. And how could they possibly know who was
                    Viet Cong and who wasn't? It was impossible. Some of the Vietnamese had weapons
                    merely to protect themselves. Then somebody came who claimed she was the aunt of
                    the little boy, and I guess everyone finally agreed that it was best that she
                    take the boy. Whether she was the aunt or not, who knows, and what she wanted
                    the boy for. That kind of incident is really sad. It was really clear that we
                    had to get out of there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were already withdrawing our forces, weren't we?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Yes. But this was a part of Vietnam where there was still some
                    fighting going on. Down in the south it had been much more pacified, but up in
                    the north it was still risky business to go out in these helicopters and little
                    villages in the hills away from the coast somewhere. Everyone was fine and
                    friendly but you better be sure you get back on that helicopter. They better
                    come and pick you up or you're stuck for the night, and in bad shape.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Well, CORDS, and I was the deputy, what they called province senior
                    adviser. A military man was the senior adviser. You had AID people there, most
                    of them were giving away wheat and helping start little projects. But by the
                    time I was there, the Vietnamese province governors, or whatever they're called,
                    chiefs, they had been handling groups of American advisers who'd been passing
                    through that place for so long, that they sort of said, why don't you get over
                    there and do your own thing. And that was really what we were doing, except some
                    of our military, always very energetic, wanted to actually get things done.
                    Occasionally they would join in on some clean-up operations out in the hills. On
                    a couple of occasions I would jump on a helicopter and go out there, and
                    actually do a little warring while I was there. I'm not particularly attracted
                    to that kind of thing, but I was curious. It kept us busy, but I was quite
                    anxious to get back to something I knew, and after a year when something opened
                    up in Saigon I was delighted to go down to the embassy .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we move down to Saigon, what was the morale like?
                        The military was bad, how about within the Foreign Service people
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: In the Foreign Service or AID, or any of those others, it was there
                    for the money primarily. There really was not much enthusiasm. You didn't see
                    any kind of dedicated people really out there that wanted to improve the
                    livelihood of the people, and that kind of thing, no. They were there to put in
                    their time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By this time, I guess, everything had been tried that
                        could have been tried, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: They were pretty well along. The Americans in their own way had done a
                    pretty good job in many ways. They did have these provinces organized. They had
                    been pacified in some of these areas. But we dealt primarily with provincial
                    militia. We didn't deal with ARVN at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ARVN being the Army of the Republic of Vietnam, the

                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: We never saw them in Tam Key. We dealt with the militia, and the
                    militia was there defending their own farm lands. So these guys were far more
                    dependable frankly to work with than the ARVN who was out to see what they could
                    get out of all this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feeling—again, we're talking about when
                        you were in the province—about corruption?</hi>

                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Oh, yes. You'd load up a truck full of bags of wheat, and it starts
                    down from Da Nang, by the time it gets to where it's going you've lost maybe 20%
                    of it. They're paying off all the way down. Oh, yes, it was rampant all over the
                    place. And even at that level I'm sure there was much bigger stuff going on
                    above it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it at this point, even though you were part of the

                        talking about the Americans, gotten pretty used to the way things were done
                        in Vietnam, and not fighting the system?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Not trying to change the world. Yes, absolutely. That's why I say
                    there wasn't anybody there that was trying to change the world, not trying to
                    change them. They were there to put in their time, and do their little bit.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Well, there wasn't progress, and it was still at that time the idea
                    that we were leaving, but we were turning over everything to the Vietnamese to
                    do the job. We'd given the ARVN all of the equipment they needed. We'd
                    established a civil authority in the provinces all over the place. The idea was
                    increasingly, let them do it themselves as we leave, hoping that somehow they
                    would be able to manage it. They called it “a decent interval.” I think there
                    was a lot of enthusiasm for this idea. An awful lot had been done in that sense.
                    There had been a lot done but it wasn't the time. To try to do that while
                    they're still fighting a war was just, I think, beyond reason.</p>

                <p>BELLOCCHI: ...in the big embassy. My office actually was in the old embassy, and
                    not in the new one, but of course we'd go to the new embassy quite often. Well,
                    you're struck by guards all over, soldiers all over protecting you, and
                    protecting the embassy—quite a large bureaucracy. The ambassador and deputy
                    ambassador had sort of a coordinating office. Charlie Hill was one I remember.
                    Hawk Mills was another one. They were fairly high level Foreign Service people.
                    They were acting as coordinators just for the ambassador's office. And then you
                    had the economic section that wrapped up the AID program people all working
                    together. You had a huge station.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Station being the CIA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: It was very large. We'd been there too long. Even our political
                    officers were getting wrapped up a lot with people trying to determine who was
                    who. But also in the corruption and the high living that went on, mostly without
                    their wives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was there '69 to '70 for 18 months. It was not a healthy
                        atmosphere.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: It was very unhealthy. I was very pleased because when I went down to
                    Saigon, I was the only Chinese language officer in the embassy at that time, and
                    Bunker wanted me to be sort of the liaison with the Chinese community. I was
                    given the title of commercial attach�, but clearly there was no commerce being
                    done there. It was a good title for working with the Chinese community. In that
                    regard, my wife, who was set up in Bangkok, and it was agreed I could have her
                    come down. There were only four or five of us that had our families in Saigon at
                    that time. It was absolutely the right decision because all of our dealings with
                    the Chinese...they're great party-givers, and the girlie restaurants are common
                    in Cho Lon. But because I had my wife we did all of our entertaining and
                    socializing with the Chinese community as families. And they, of course, were
                    very accommodating in bringing their wives for a change to a party. But that
                    made it much easier for me to conduct myself in the way we should conduct
                    ourselves, by having the family there. It made a big difference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because so much of what went on was sort of a bachelor
                        existence. Americans aren't very good at this sort of thing. I mean, we
                        either feel uncomfortable, or you go overboard.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: And we socialize a lot, so therefore it was a bad situation. Most of
                    the Americans that were there were bachelors, but so many had people they stayed
                    with. It was not a healthy atmosphere, and a lot of them got wrapped up in these
                    things. I was just pleased that I could have the family there.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, I want to talk about the '71 to '72 period. How
                        could you characterize the Chinese community, and how did they fit into the
                        scheme of things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: They controlled the economy, of course, just as they do in most
                    southeastern Asian countries. Many of them were very, very helpful to the
                    Vietnamese authorities. Many of the Vietnamese and Chinese had known each other
                    for years. I think many of them made themselves a fortune. But they also
                    cooperated very much, and were very helpful. I remember one of the Viet Cong
                    campaigns out in the countryside outside of Saigon. Several of the Chinese owned
                    a lot of textile factories around the area. They kept their people employed even
                    when they were not able to produce anything because of the Viet Cong
                    interdictions in the roads that prevented any delivery of the goods. They just
                    kept them employed. They were almost like the family, almost like the mafia type
                    of situation where some of these guys are very important, and very rough, but
                    they have a whole group of sub-businessmen that sort of rely on them. And these
                    leading Chinese were very paternalistic in the way they dealt with their
                    subordinates.</p>
                <p>I can remember the Economic Minister asking me if I could help in talking to the
                    Chinese community to keep the price of rice from increasing. It was during a
                    Viet Cong campaign when traditionally the price of rice would start jumping up.
                    And they did. And I think in that sense they were very cooperative. The leading
                    businessmen all took care of themselves, and once Saigon fell most of them wound
                    up in places like Hong Kong. They all had passports that got them out. So
                    common. Many and most of them that went to places like Hong Kong, did not
                    survive very long in the business sense. Their ability to make a lot of money,
                    was in knowing the country, and the officials, and the human relationships. Once
                    they got into another a Chinese area, where they could even speak the language,
                    they didn't know how to operate and they lost their money very quickly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see, because I think it has some pertinence to
                        almost what is happening in the United States, the Chinese have this
                        renowned ability to go in and sort of set up business, small stores, what
                        have you. And the Vietnamese seem to be less, you might say, business
                        aggressive. When I was there at almost the same time, there was great
                        concern in Vietnam because we had a lot of what they called third country
                        nationals, TCNs, and among them the Koreans were coming in, and the Koreans
                        are great business people, and they were pushing the Vietnamese aside, and
                        also the Filipinos, but particularly Koreans. The Koreans also seem to have
                        this instinct. Did you find this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: The Chinese are entrepreneurial, it's almost part of the culture, and
                    it has been for hundreds and hundreds of years. Yes, they're entrepreneurial,
                    and because their society and culture is based on human relationships so
                    intensely that they're the best networkers in the world. Even here in America if
                    you go around the Chinese-American community, they have hundreds of
                    associations. Chinese Americans join as many of them as they can, and they
                    network around the country. I'm amazed when I go to meetings here, and find,
                    hey, there's so-and-so from Chicago. There's another one from Atlanta. They get
                    together all the time, they're networking all the time. That's their strength.
                    And it's true in southeast Asia as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now you're at the embassy looking at the bigger picture
                        and I guess you were getting some reflection although you were concerned
                        with the Chinese element, what were you getting from your friends at the
                        embassy, or dealing with the sort of mega situation, whither Vietnam? We're
                        talking about '71 to '72.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: In that period of time, I think what I would say is the lower levels
                    in the embassy and AID, and all the others, were still complaining about the
                    corruption of Vietnam as if it was unique to Vietnam. Those of us who have
                    traveled around southeast Asia know that it was part of the whole culture in the
                    whole area. There was nothing unusual about the corruption in Vietnam. Number
                    two, I think that by that time I was certainly impressed with the Vietnamese
                    leadership of the ministerial level, for example. There probably was some
                    corruption. I'm sure there was, but by and large I was impressed with how little
                    there was. There were very many dedicated people in that leadership. I took part
                    in the negotiations between the Vietnamese and some of our oil companies when
                    they were starting to negotiate exploring out there in the area. Boy, it was
                    really very straight, open, transparent. They were very, very careful to keep it
                    very open and transparent so there wasn't any corruption. I remember the
                    Economic Minister was trying to keep the price of rice from going up, and he was
                    always very open the way he was doing things. So I think there were a lot of our
                    senior people in the embassy who had gotten to know the senior people in the
                    Vietnamese government and had considerable confidence in these people. They were
                    doing a pretty good job actually. It may have taken 12 years before it got to
                    that stage, but certainly at that stage there were some pretty good people in
                    the government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're pointing out something that I think anybody who is
                        looking at these oral histories, and later things, but it seems to me
                        there's a generational thing. I was basically a consular officer, but had
                        the same thing. After I'd been around for a while, I knew there was a
                        certain amount of lying, and everything else in order to get a visa. But the
                        young officer would come in and coming out of the American culture,
                        horrified; somebody lied to me. Or somebody tried to pay me off. And after
                        you've been around for a while, okay, it's just part of the game.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: It's part of the system.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You turn them down, but you don't turn this into...I think
                        the younger people tend to be terribly puritanical, because they're just not
                        ready for this coming out of our society. Today it would be different.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: If you don't voice indignation, they take it to be an acceptance. It's
                    not acceptance but you understand what they're thinking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So I think this is why often one will find many of the
                        protests and the screams coming more from the junior ranks than the more
                        seniors. It's not because the more senior is jaded, or less tolerant, it
                        just understands the situation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: It's just understanding. It's not just a morality problem, but it's an
                    understanding of the problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got on the plane at Tan San Nyut, you and your
                        wife, what did you think whither Vietnam when you left in '72?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Well, clearly we were leaving, I mean, the U.S. was leaving Vietnam
                    rather quickly. I think there was some optimism that they would be able to hold
                    out. I really do. I think that generally...maybe there was some secret
                    assessments of which I was not a part, where they thought that they couldn't.
                    But I think that by and large people at that time were thinking, we've done a
                    fairly good job and we're giving them the wherewithal. Part of my job as
                    “commercial attach�" was to take part in the local procurement program. Instead
                    of buying things offshore for AID and all the other things that were going on,
                    increasingly we were looking for local suppliers to do that so the Vietnamese
                    could start to generate their own system. I think that there was some optimism
                    that maybe they could hold out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I felt the same when I left in '70 too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: It may have been unrealistic but it was the case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was in many ways a military defeat too, which is always
                        different from just a collapse.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: And that's why I think there's some criticism of a recent book of
                    McNamara that he doesn't mention the Vietnamese, there were a lot of Vietnamese
                    that devoted themselves completely to the cause.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: McNamara just came out with sort of a mea culpa book—this
                        is Robert McNamara, Secretary of Defense for most of the Vietnam time, and
                        which has gained a lot of attention, but it's all America, and it's all, “We
                        did it wrong.” I think it's terribly limited but its gained a lot of
                        notoriety.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Yes, and I think it did not bring in the Vietnamese, and the amount of
                    sacrifice that those people made. You know, wrongly or rightly, they did make an
                    enormous sacrifice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So when you left in 1972 whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Tokyo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: The reason I'd actually left a few months early because the boss I
                    had, the commercial attach� in Taipei, when I left, was then the commercial
                    counselor in Tokyo. And he called down and said, “Would you like to come up to
                    be the commercial attach� in Tokyo?” Well, of course, that was at that time the
                    top commercial post of the world, I think. It was a big section. And I liked
                    Bongard, who was then the commercial counselor, so I said, “Sure.” And we direct
                    transferred up to Tokyo, and I became the commercial attach�, and wrote three or
                    four papers about the Keiretsu, the old zaibatsu. And the papers that I wrote
                    then, there were about four airgrams, were unclassified, and we passed them out
                    to interested American businessmen. Fourteen years later one of the local
                    employees came to Washington, I was here, and he said, “We're still using those
                    papers out there as handouts.”</p>
                <p>During my home leave from Tokyo I got promoted to FSO-2, under the old
                    system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which puts you into the senior ranks.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Yes, but there wasn't that difference in those days. My boss there was
                    retiring and recommended that I replace him. The Commerce people were apparently
                    unable to come to a consensus on who it was they wanted to send out there.
                    Though it was a common retirement position for commercial types, it was the
                    largest commercial counselor job in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it was obviously where you wanted somebody who was full
                        of piss and vinegar rather than as a retirement post.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: They wanted a retiree, but couldn't agree. There was a lot of
                    infighting going on at that time over in Commerce. So as a compromise they
                    accepted me as the commercial counselor. For an FSO-2 that was quite a job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I always like to get the time element. You were in Tokyo

                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: '72 to '74. It was in '74 that I was assigned to the Senior

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador when you were in Tokyo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Ingersoll.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had a labor...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: No. Chairman of Borg Warner.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would imagine that he would be interested in the
                        commercial side.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: He did have a lot of functions for visiting businessmen at that time.
                    Oh yes, he was very, very helpful, and really very nice, he and his wife. So
                    they used their facilities, their huge reception room in the residence for
                    business oriented receptions. So, yes, he was very interested and very easy to
                    work with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the principal work that you did? Both in
                        commercial attach� and commercial counselor.</hi>

                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Well, one was to try to come up with these analyses of why are these
                    Japanese trading companies successful, and what do we have to learn from them.
                    So I tried to do a lot of reporting and generate a lot of reporting on how they
                    operated. And secondly, of course, was export promotion. And in Japan that was
                    very important to try to break down. The economic people were trying to work
                    back here with negotiations to break down the barriers. We even had a trade
                    center, and we had shows going on all the time, trying to increase our exports.
                    Our biggest problem was the same old traditional one, the big companies don't
                    need that kind of service. They know how to operate abroad. It's the middle and
                    smaller companies that need it, and they wouldn't make the commitments to
                    exporting in those days. I think the times have changed now, but in those days
                    such companies looked on exporting as something they did when the domestic
                    market wasn't doing well. If they wanted to maintain their production line, they
                    would go into export. Then the minute the economy picked up in the States they
                    would forget about exporting. And you can't really keep agents abroad doing your
                    work for you very well if you're up and down that way.</p>
                <p>I had an experience that was fascinating when Mitsukoshi, a big department store,
                    came to us. Wine and cheese was a fad at that time in Japan. They said they
                    understood that one of the big winery companies in California shipped wine in
                    bulk in tankers around to the east coast, and bottled their wine in the east
                    coast for distribution. And they would like to buy a tanker full of wine, and
                    have it bottled under a Mitsukoshi label. In return, a certain percentage of
                    their wine area in the stores would be for California wines. I mean we're
                    talking about a tanker full of wine. So we tried to find, and get people
                    interested, but could not find anybody interested in selling a whole oil
                    tanker-type ship full of wine to Japan. Couldn't do it.</p>
                <p>The next year, when I was in the Senior Seminar, we happened to stop out there on
                    one of our trips to a California Wine Growers Association barbecue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Yes, you were there, and they complained about not getting much help
                    in exporting their wines. That was more than I could take. I got up and told
                    them about my experience in trying to get a whole tanker full of wine. Their
                    rationale was: “Well, but that was in a good year here in the States and we had
                    the domestic market, we didn't have the wine available for export.” That's
                    precisely the point about why they couldn't develop their export market. So that
                    was our main problem in that job, trying to get the American companies to
                    understand there's a huge market there. But it wasn't free, they had to work for
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had the same experience when I was in the Persian Gulf
                        back in the '50s where Americans would once a year send somebody from Geneva
                        through there, a small market, but it was obviously one that was going to
                        develop. I was the economic/commercial officer in Dhahran, and they would
                        come through once a year and they'd usually come through, they'd fly in on
                        Thursday and leave on Saturday, and Friday was the day everybody was out. It
                        was that type of thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: We did that. They were very unrealistic when they'd come to Tokyo and
                    say they had ten appointments for two days in Tokyo. You know, that really
                    didn't make any sense at all. Just the traffic in Tokyo alone assures you you're
                    not going be able to have five appointments in one day. That was a major problem
                    in our job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're speaking today, where I think the President has
                        signed an order putting prohibitive tariffs on certain Japanese cars, or
                        threatened to. I mean, this goes on, but one looks at this where we feel,
                        one, the Japanese market is closed, and two, we don't seem to be able to
                        commit ourselves to you might say, hard selling within the area.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Times have changed. I'm not suggesting the same is true today as it
                    was then. But I have little sympathy, for example, for the automobile people who
                    complain about the lack of an open market in Japan. A lot of it was due to two
                    reasons in my time. One is, first of all they didn't make a car that was very
                    sellable in Japan. I mean, the steering wheel is on the wrong side to start
                    with. Secondly, they liked to use local dealers who would treat the American car
                    as sort of a special fad car which did not mean a large market, it meant a high
                    price. That's what it meant. So they didn't have the distribution system
                    developed there that they should have. So part of it was their fault themselves.
                    They really weren't developing the kind of market that they should be
                    developing. We used to complain a great deal about the distribution system in
                    Japan. They're all mom and pop stores, and therefore they favored the Japanese,
                    and our companies couldn't sell on the Japanese market because of that
                    distribution system. Well here we are in the States trying to redevelop the
                    local communities stores. They are now, of course, chain stores instead of mom
                    and pop stores. Here we were looking the Japanese in the eye and saying, you've
                    got to change your distribution system so that our companies can sell over here.
                    And they're looking back at you, and saying, “Hey wait a minute, these people
                    vote and I don't particularly want to change.” So in the commercial section we
                    were looking at the Japanese side of it a lot, and trying to develop
                    understanding back here. Whereas in the economic area, of course, they focused
                    on the real obstacles to trade. There were plenty of obstacles to trade. There
                    were non-tariff barriers that existed that had to be lowered. But time and again
                    we'd finally get them to lower the beef quota, or shoes, or something and other
                    countries would come in and sell. The Spanish would come in and sell the shoes,
                    the Australians would come in and sell the beef, so all of our work would be for
                    naught.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came back from '74 to '75, you went to the Senior
                        Seminar where we were jointly then. Then where did you go after that, Nat,
                        from '75?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: In '75 I began a year in Treasury in the OASIA bureau. The Congress
                    was always interested in having Treasury do a study on why American companies
                    couldn't sell more to the International Financial Institutions(IFI) development,
                    like the World Bank in some of their projects around the world. So I did a year
                    making that study on how we might improve our capability for getting American
                    companies to bid on some of these big projects financed by the IFIs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the problems that you found?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: I'm trying to recall. In fact I still have that study stacked away
                    someplace. I came up with different improvements that government could make in
                    the services that it provides. And I came up with other private sector
                    initiatives as well. The most important part of it, I thought, was that if we
                    could change our laws...I forget the names now of the different laws we had,
                    that prevented our companies from getting together on big major projects
                    overseas. They have since changed the law in fact to make this possible, that in
                    exporting or in external operations our American companies can get together to
                    jointly bid on some of these big projects. I'm talking about making it as much
                    as possible like the Japanese trading companies. They do the bidding, but they
                    have some of their own family companies, heavy industry and shipping, and
                    insurance and banking, and all the other things that are necessary to put a
                    package together for a large project. I thought we shouldn't try to mimic the
                    Japanese. We don't have the large trading companies; but we do have commercial
                    banks that are worldwide, and the same kind of communication system the Japanese
                    trading companies have. They have all these customer companies that deal with
                    the bank, from heavy industry, power, insurance, all these other sectors. Our
                    commercial banks would be the best packager for these big major projects
                    overseas. But it was necessary to have a clear understanding that it wouldn't
                    get entangled in anti-trust suits by doing so. So I made some recommendations in
                    that study that might make it possible to do. I think there has been some change
                    in the laws since then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then in '76, where to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: India—Indja.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in India from '76 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: '79. That's when our three year cycle for overseas tours started. I
                    was the economic counselor.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find India at that time? India is both a
                        fascinating place, but for Americans I think Indians can be very difficult
                        to deal with.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Sure, but they can also be very good friends. You can make some good
                    personal relationships. You can also meet many that have you crawling up the
                    wall. But it's a big country, and they're not without their pride. I think that
                    if you take that into account, you really can make some good friends. It is an
                    open democratic country. I got there when Gandhi had declared an emergency.
                    During much of the time I was there we were in this emergency period. Then she
                    permitted open elections and got defeated. The Janata party won, and it was the
                    first non-congress government that they had there, so all of that was very
                    fascinating. Politically there was a lot of change taking place. Economically,
                    still very difficult for American companies to do business there. And there was
                    some animosity because there had been some rather unfriendly exchanges. India
                    was considered to be too close to the Soviet Union as you remember in those
                    days. They weren't really a friend even though they were a democracy. So there
                    were these kinds of strains in the political relationship, but you still could
                    do a lot of work there. I spent a lot of my time negotiating the reopening of
                    our AID program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in India? Why would we want an AID
                        program at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Well, we'd had one. We had a very huge AID program there, and then we
                    didn't get the right kind of treatment I guess. We thought they favored the
                    Soviet Union, or whatever it was. We cut out most of our aid except for PL 480
                    humanitarian assistance. Our AID people were interested in getting back into the
                    aid business in India, certainly a place that needed it. I think there were many
                    also that wanted to reopen our participation in World Bank projects, for
                    example, multilateral arrangements. Our AID people were more interested in the
                    bilateral, but we at the embassy were more interested in staying away from the
                    political problems that the AID program had had in the past, and that we join
                    multilateral projects more than bilateral. It was about 50-50 actually when it
                    finally came out. We joined some irrigation projects, but it was a long sticky
                    process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why would India...I mean it certainly had the intellectual
                        know-how, why would it need AID projects?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: They needed capital. They didn't need the technical assistance.
                    They're very capable in the scientific areas especially, but they needed the
                    capital for things that had to be done, especially things out in the
                    countryside, the irrigation projects for example, big infrastructure projects.
                    They needed outside assistance, they needed capital, they needed some technical
                    know-how. They didn't have the kind of companies that could do some of that kind
                    of work. They relied mostly on multilateral AID so that they could maintain
                    political control.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dealing with AID sometimes can almost be like a foreign
                        power. I'm talking about the American AID program.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: You better believe it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you give your impressions? This is the first time
                        you're really up against AID in a non- wartime situation. I mean, there you
                        are, you're the economic counselor, and AID says, “We want to do some
                        projects.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: That was by far the toughest task we had. Negotiating with the Indians
                    was not easy. They're very good negotiators, and it took a long stretch of time.
                    But quite frankly the differences between State and AID were far greater.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our concern? I mean, what were the problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Our objective was that AID didn't get back in the position they were
                    in before, where they were so dominant in this whole area that it caused us
                    political problems. The Indians do not want to have a foreign power telling them
                    what to do. And AID was telling them what to do, and they had a lot of money to
                    back them up. I think the concern of the embassy was that we restart the AID
                    program in a gradual way, and we do it to the greatest extent possible through
                    multilateral rather than bilateral means to avoid the political problems of the
                    past. And the multilaterals did a good job in those days. World Bank irrigation
                    projects, and dams, and all these other things were pretty good. AID didn't
                    agree with that, of course. They preferred the bilateral, and they wanted direct
                    control over projects themselves. So that was our biggest battle.</p>
                <p>Number two was the amount. I think State in those days said, let's start small
                    because we feel that the aid to India process has got to be developed, and its
                    got to progress gradually, or it's going to become an even greater political
                    problem, so let's not go overboard. But in those days AID was thinking in terms
                    of a billion dollar AID program again in India. No way did we want that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way did you have the feeling that AID was looking for
                        a place to play after it lost its big ___ in Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: That's right, and thank goodness Egypt came up and drained some of
                    their attention to take the pressure off India. I was in Laos in the ''60s when
                    our military contingent left after the Geneva Agreement. Our military people
                    left, our AID people came back in, and the influx of aid was so fast, and so
                    large, that it overshadowed the departure of the military by far. They can
                    really take over a place in no time at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean this was very much in the mind, a large
                        bureaucracy, and large bureaucracies cause problems.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: They're very good at this. I remember them going to a fellow at Yale
                    University to come up with a study on why there ought to be a very large AID
                    program in India. They searched around the country and got the kind of study
                    they wanted and they had him write it. So we had to overcome that. My name was
                    mud with the AID program in those days, but I think we succeeded. Bob Goheen was
                    the ambassador who was born and raised in India. A former president of Princeton
                    University. And he sided with us and helped us a great deal to keep the AID
                    monster from taking over. As the economic counselor in the embassy, my office
                    was in a little portion of the new embassy we had there. The ambassador's
                    office, the DCM's office, the reception area, and the conference room on one
                    side, and on the other side was what was built to be the AID director's office
                    with a little kitchenette, and a shower, and all this business, and a place for
                    the secretary. The economic counselor had always occupied that little suite of
                    offices. Why? Because when it was built the AID director said he wasn't about to
                    move into the embassy. He had a much better office. So it was the economic
                    counselor's office, it was quite an office.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about commercial ties with India?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: We had a commercial attach� in the embassy. But in those days, no, not
                    very much. Coca Cola had been bounced out because they had done what they should
                    do, they'd appointed an Indian director for Coca Cola India and he promptly got
                    involved in politics. When Gandhi lost the election, boom, out he went, and Coca
                    Cola was finished for some years. I think they're back in now, but there were a
                    lot of problems for our companies. It was very difficult to do business in
                    India.</p>

                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: No, very bureaucratic. It was very, very difficult to weave your way
                    through the bureaucracy. And there wasn't any great incentive to take in the
                    American and foreign companies. It was still that great feeling that the
                    foreigners would try to control their economy. They had a lot of barriers
                    against that happening. The barriers, of course, prevented our companies from
                    operating the way they wanted to operate. The fellow that was the head of the
                    economic department in the Ministry of Finance, and the one we had the most to
                    do with, is now the Minister of Finance, Monmohan Singh. A very bright guy.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: They had that special trade deal with the Soviets, the Rupee-Ruble
                    Trade, and we devoted a lot of time trying to figure out what exchange rate was
                    being used between the two so we could measure how much that was. The Indians
                    took quite a beating on that, frankly, but they were paying off their military
                    procurement salaries(?).</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back to Hong Kong.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: It was my last assignment in Hong Kong. Tom Shoesmith, then the Consul
                    General, called me in India and he said, “Would you like to come and be the
                    deputy?”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was '79 to '81.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: I'd worked with Tom before. Tom was the DCM in Tokyo when I was in
                    Tokyo, so he called, And I said, “Sure, I'd love to get back into the China
                    area.” I went back to be the deputy principal officer, as it's called there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What does the deputy principal office...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: It's a separate consulate general. It was nominally under the US
                    embassy in the UK, but actually it was one of the two, I think, Consulates
                    General that report directly back to Washington.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '79 to '81, what was the situation in Hong Kong?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Well, by that time we were just opening up with China. Oh, the tales
                    we would hear from Taipei on that, were really sad. I've always been affected
                    quite frankly, even in my present job, by the very crude way we handled that
                    situation in Taipei. I'm not saying the decision was wrong. The decision, of
                    course, was almost inevitable that we were going to be recognizing China. But
                    the way we handled even our own people. I'm not talking about the crude way we
                    handled the Taiwan side of it. That's politics. But our own people practically
                    were treated like an enemy. Washington cut off communications, they weren't
                    getting their pay. I mean, there was no rational reason why, just because
                    they're in Taipei, our people should be treated that way.</p>
                <p>I think if you talk with some of the people who were there at the time, they
                    really felt that they had suddenly been cast out. It could have been done in a
                    much more gradual way. It was a done deed. We could have just gradually brought
                    our people out, made changes, developed a system. This organization I'm in now
                    was just being developed. Instead we decided to lower the boom, bang, everything
                    had to be stopped immediately, leaving all those people out there high, wide and
                    dry. It was awful. We were just hearing about this in Hong Kong and the way it
                    was being done. And then we were all finding all this business new. We could
                    actually walk into the Bank of China lobby and look. That was forbidden
                    territory before. And people were starting to go into China across the Lowu
                    bridge, walk across the bridge and catch the train on the other side. It was
                    really very interesting, and I got to know some, but not many, of the Chinese
                    commercial people. Not like today, it was all strange for them too.</p>
                <p>It was a different world, and Hong Kong by that time itself had changed
                    considerably.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In what way had it changed?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: It had become much more of a big metropolitan place than it had been
                    in the past. They were tearing down buildings that were only 10-15 years old. I
                    remember seeing the third generation building going up just across from the
                    consulate, in that one spot. It was the third building that I knew of that was
                    in that spot in the time I knew Hong Kong. It was going on all over the country
                    that way, and there was big business going on. Hong Kong had become a very
                    important entrepot. So it was much busier, the American Chamber of Commerce had
                    grown enormously at that time. We spent a lot of time promoting American
                    business. As I recall, we had something like 16 different U.S. government
                    agencies in Hong Kong, all with regional responsibilities, because you could fly
                    in and out of Hong Kong so easily. Everybody seemed to have a regional office in
                    Hong Kong, and trying to keep all those people together in some
                    fashion...frankly I think we only had a broad country team meeting maybe a
                    couple times a month because it was huge. And nobody ever said anything, because
                    nobody knew what the other guy was doing anyway half the time. I suspect there's
                    quite an exodus now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling towards the unification with
                        China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Oh, you mean Hong Kong's unification. When I was there it was still a
                    little bit down the road. But Hong Kong never operated very long on a long term
                    anyway. Even the business community always looked at the next two, or three, or
                    four years and expected to get their money back. So when you're talking about 12
                    or 14 years down the road, that's long term. Even things like the tunnel...for
                    years and years in Hong Kong you'd hear about the need to build a bridge from
                    Hong Kong to Kowloon, etc., and nobody would ever build a bridge. And then they
                    talked about the tunnel, and the government certainly wasn't going to come up
                    with that kind of money. They didn't do things like that. If someone wanted it,
                    the private sector would have to do it, and they did. A group of them got
                    together, and I remember watching how they were lowering those things in the
                    tunnel when they were building it. They opened that tunnel after I left but in
                    subsequent visits that I made there, I was told the companies that invested in
                    that first tunnel got their money back the first year. They were just coining
                    money, and it was all private. Incredible.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about China watching during this '79 to '81

                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: It was still there, but I think there was a larger effort now to
                    justify its existence because suddenly China had opened up and you could go
                    inside and see these things. But I think at that time still, after the initial
                    urge of saying, “Okay, let's shut down and move up to there”, there were second
                    thoughts. First of all, there was no place for all these people up there in
                    Beijing. Our people were living in the hotels. And secondly, there was beginning
                    to be an understanding that even if you're there you don't know too much about
                    what's going on. It's such a closed society that you could probably see even
                    better from out in Hong Kong than you could up there. So, the China operations
                    continued. It was somewhat smaller, but it still continued quite a bit. As far
                    as I know it still does.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: No, Carter came to India while I was in India. I remember the campaign
                    because the American business community out there was very heavily Republican in
                    the campaign. So it straddled Carter and Reagan.</p>

                        you all, dealing with China, China and the mega picture, feel about the
                        advent of Reagan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: There may have been some thinking, but I don't really recall much
                    discussion of that. Taiwan was still Mars from the standpoint of the Hong Kong
                    perspective. It was really someplace else that didn't attract attention. So even
                    within the consulate I don't think there was all that much discussion of, what
                    does that mean for the China relationship? And I was back in Washington by the
                    time the 1982 communique was signed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to backtrack quickly. You mentioned you were in
                        India when Carter visited. Presidential visits are always interesting. Can
                        you tell me a little about your experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Yes, it was hilarious because I was acting DCM for a while at that
                    time of preparing for the visit. We were notified that Carter was going to stop.
                    They told us that he would have, including newsmen, around 250-270 people with
                    him. So I went over to the protocol officer, I remember his name was Peter
                    Sinai, who was later, I think, DCM here in the Indian embassy. I talked about
                    the visit of Carter. They were happy that Carter was going to stop in Delhi, and
                    I said he was going to bring 270 people. And he said, “What! 270 people, where
                    are you going to put them?” Well, I said, “I hope we can get a hotel for them,
                    and we'd like to have them all together.” He said, “That's impossible.” And he
                    named the different hotels that they had, and he said they'd have to be broken
                    up, we can't possibly just move out people. But after a week he finally called
                    and said, “Let's get together.” But before I went out there I had gotten a
                    message from Washington that there were going to be a few more. So when I got
                    over to Peter Sinai, he said, “Well, we've struggled and we've finally got rooms
                    in the Ashoka hotel for 270 people.” And I said that I had just gotten a message
                    that there would be 525 people. He almost fell off his chair. Anyway, it was
                    unbelievable. The only thing they could finally do was just take over the whole
                    hotel. They had to move all these people out, and it must have created havoc for
                    the tourist industry.</p>
                <p>In addition to which the press, of course, was going to be at a hotel. We had to
                    lay a cable from the embassy to another hotel, not too long a distance, about 2
                    or 3 blocks. But they actually had to dig a trench, just like we do in laying
                    cables, tear up the road and laid a huge cable from the embassy to the hotel,
                    and then resurface. All of this had to be paid for by us. The Indians weren't
                    going to do it. They said, you want it, you pay for it. We had to lay that cable
                    for communications. All that enormous undertaking for just a two day visit.</p>
                <p>The Indians have the Rashtrapati Bhavan as their presidential palace, built by
                    the British. The Viceroy used to live there, a huge place. Half of it is the
                    residence of the president of India, and the other half is the guest house for
                    state visitors. So Carter was put in the guest house, in the Rashtrapati Bhavan.
                    All the security people, ours and theirs, were all around that place. In those
                    days the Minister of Health in India, I can't remember his name, but he was a
                    character - he used to wear a woman's stocking on his head - but not a dummy by
                    any means. He was a bright guy, but he was just an eccentric. He would make
                    these speeches that always got news play. Here's Carter in the Rashtrapati
                    Bhavan, and he'd had a certain hour to rest, and he comes out after his rest
                    period, and said, “Who was that fellow who was in there talking to me?” The
                    Secret Service just about flipped. It was the Minister of Health, and he'd
                    walked in to the Rashtrapati Bhavana through all the security people, walked
                    into the suite with our President and spent an hour talking to Carter. Anyway,
                    it was one of these hilarious things. He was a harmless fellow. He had an
                    interesting conversation with Carter, and Carter didn't even know who he was
                    talking to.</p>

                        think there probably would have been even more work because you could get

                    that they couldn't increase the staff. Washington was always cutting. There was
                    still plenty of reporting although less than the major newspaper that we used to
                    read all the time, The People's Daily, and that was easily accessible up in

                <p>BELLOCCHI: '81 until '85.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in INR?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: I started for the first few months as the deputy assistant secretary.
                    In those days the DASs were called deputy assistant secretaries, but the head of
                    INR was still called director. That was later changed to assistant secretary
                    also, but we were called deputy assistant secretary, and I was the deputy
                    assistant secretary for long term analysis. That still was a part of INR that
                    they were reluctant to do away with even though it was continually shrinking as
                    the current analysis took more and more of the resources.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like a certain amount of duplication with the
                        Policy Planning, maybe not in reality.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Except for the one big factor that you must always keep in mind.
                    Intelligence should not get involved in policy recommendations. It should be
                    straight reporting only. Only the bureaus and Policy Planning can recommend
                    policy. So therefore, there was always that difference. But the fact is that the
                    function of INR, which started out as long term planning only, with the
                    intelligence community taking care of current analysis, increasingly got
                    involved in current analysis itself, and less and less in long term analysis.
                    That is now increasingly being done over in the CIA. I was there for a few
                    months and then the DAS for current analysis left, and I was switched over from
                    long term to current analysis. And that's where I spent most of my time in
                    INR.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you saw it at the time, we're talking about the early
                        ''80s, the Reagan administration is just in, you've got a very controversial
                        figure over at the CIA, William Casey. Where did State Department
                        intelligence research fit into this mix as you saw it? In the first place,
                        who was the director?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Montgomery, who was from the CIA, but politically appointed to be the
                    director of the Bureau of Intelligence. In fact, while most of our Foreign
                    Service colleagues grumbled at this idea, he was quite good for the purpose INR
                    was intended. Too many in the Foreign Service like to make INR an instrument of
                    support for policy. But he very clearly kept it separate. As an old intelligence
                    officer, he was absolutely sure, to make that clear. And I think it worked very
                    well because of that. But as to where INR itself fits, it's a member of the
                    intelligence community, but of course, a very small member because needless to
                    say other members are rather large and have considerable resources. But because
                    we were small, I think we were a highly respected element of the intelligence
                    community.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>We, for example, did the morning summary for the Secretary. The Secretary of
                    Defense, the Vice President, the head of CIA, and the head of NSA,: all wanted a
                    copy to know what the Secretary was getting. It was six pages typewritten every
                    day. It wasn't fancy, it wasn't printed, there was no color, there was nothing.
                    It was just six typewritten pages, and because of that it had a much bigger
                    impact on the top level readers of intelligence in this town because it really
                    was seen to be a product of analysts sitting down and saying, this is what I
                    think is important for you to know, Mr. Secretary. It was not the sort of
                    polished things that made it look as if its been really worked on so much that
                    its lost its punch. Our position was that we sat in on the intelligence
                    community meetings, and when estimates of national intelligence were made, the
                    INR took part in drafting up these. We seldom were the chief drafters simply
                    because we didn't have the resources. That always put us at a disadvantage
                    because, as you know, drafters of all reports usually have a very big advantage.
                    But nonetheless, in the Casey years, he accepted that when an element of the
                    community could not agree, footnotes would be permitted in the estimates. And
                    you could be sure that about 90% of the time there would be footnotes, and I
                    would say that of the 90% of the time, 75% to 80%, it was INR that had the
                    footnote. But he permitted that, and thank goodness because we really disagreed
                    many times in those years. There was an inclination by the leadership over there
                    to get...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Leadership where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: CIA...to change the summary. When you have an estimate, the summary,
                    in the two or three pages at the front is what everybody reads except the
                    analysts way down at the bottom who read all the details. So Casey was never
                    concerned about what was in the body of the estimate, but he was very concerned
                    about what was in the summary. I've heard stories of him taking a yellow pad
                    home and rewriting the whole summary itself to be sure it said the things that
                    he wanted to say. I think him being a member of the cabinet was not a good idea.
                    I think there was too much of an introduction of policy into that. And I'll
                    never forget...I used to have to sit in on some of the intelligence community
                    meetings at which the next estimate would be discussed. It was usually attended
                    by the director of INR but when he was gone I would sometimes go over. And I
                    remember one on Libya. As the discussion took place, first the man that wrote it
                    made his presentation, of course in very glowing terms about how accurate, and
                    how sound it was. Then the number two of the agency stood up, and agreed
                    wholeheartedly that it was a very sound estimate. And then it started to go
                    around the table, and every member of the intelligence community, which is a
                    rather large group, all stood up and said it was a great assessment. I had
                    instructions from my people to say it was a disaster.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was on Libya did you say?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Yes, on Libya, and especially on its relationships with the Soviet
                    Union at that time. So it worked itself around the table, and there I was about
                    the second to the last one to speak up, and I had to say, I forget what they
                    used to call him, Mr. Director whatever it was...Casey was there standing up
                    heading the show, and clearly very much supportive of that estimate. And I was
                    saying, “INR wants this returned for further study.” And he just went right up
                    through the ceiling. “What? How can you do this?” I knew when I said it that
                    that was going to happen, and eventually we agreed that we would put in some
                    footnotes as to why we thought this was not a sound estimate, and he accepted
                    that. It was an example of the politicalization of intelligence.</p>
                <p>We'd had a lot of stories in INR. It was a very, very eventful time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can we talk about some of these? Some of the issues that I
                        think about, Libya is one, Lebanon, Israel, and of course, Central America,
                        and I guess there were probably other ones.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: We were at odds with the regional bureaus on every one of those
                    issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we work geographically. Let's start at Central
                        America. We're talking about a time when we felt Nicaragua was under the
                        Sandinistas and we felt it was trying to upset the regional balance, and
                        President Reagan was vehement about talking about if the cancer spreads,
                        Brownsville, Texas is next. And things were being done there and support,
                        all of which ended up in the so-called Iran Contra affair which became a
                        criminal problem. Could you talk about INR's role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: I knew a little bit more about the others. The reason I don't know as
                    much about Central America, is that Hank Cohen who was the senior deputy in INR
                    at that time, knew a great deal more, so therefore I would always turn to him
                    and say, “What do you think of this?” But by and large, we were opposed to the
                    support given to the Contras. Our analysts were coming up with sufficient
                    analysis on the weakness of that machine down in Nicaragua, and sometimes the
                    softness of the intelligence that was being used to support them. Such as the
                    mining incident, for example.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the mining of...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: ...that small harbor.</p>

                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: But you know, one of the things that I do remember about Central
                    America was the difficulty of handling sensitive intelligence in this day and
                    age. You know when there was a time...the papers were full of a ship that left a
                    certain harbor in the Soviet Union, the Black Sea, which was the traditional
                    harbor for weapons that were being transported to third world countries. Most of
                    it went from this particular harbor. And intelligence had picked up boxes that
                    normally carried MiGs on this ship, and as it left the Black Sea and went into
                    the Mediterranean it headed west. Already there was speculation that these were
                    MiGs meant for, I guess it was Nicaragua. And as it wound its way through
                    Gibraltar and out into the Atlantic, somebody was paying attention and we would
                    get first thing in the morning, hot news on exactly where that ship was and
                    where it was headed, and any kind of official details on the shape of the boxes
                    and why they were sure they carried MiGs. And every morning, before 9:00 I would
                    get a call from John Scali of ABC news, and he said, “I understand” and then he
                    would start explaining what I had just read in a very super sensitive cable. I
                    thought, “Oh my gosh, how is this guy getting this kind of information?” So, I
                    think Secretary Shultz from time to time talked about the fact that the world
                    has become such an open place in terms of information, and it's very difficult
                    to conduct foreign policy when it was being reported that quickly in the press,
                    when you yourself had not yet decided what it is you're going to do, or how
                    seriously you should take it. Here's the press already talking about it. So that
                    was one of the things I always remember about the Central America period. But
                    clearly our people were making ARA quite unhappy with the kind of analysis that
                    we were going up with in INR.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why would you be at odds with ARA? Was it because ARA had
                        become politicized, or was it just a different perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: It's a different perspective. You have to understand, we're often at
                    odds with most of the regional bureaus because they have an added
                    responsibility. They not only analyze, but then they have to decide what it is
                    you should do about it. So they then have to take what is always imperfect in
                    terms of information, and say this is what our judgment is, and on that basis we
                    recommend you do such and such in foreign policy. We never had to take that
                    responsibility, so we could be much stronger in saying, this is soft stuff, this
                    is the reason why it might not work because of this. In other words, we were on
                    the margins nitpicking the regional bureaus. So it was very difficult for them
                    to make recommendations to the Secretary when he himself had some other
                    information that said, you better be careful, this may not be exactly accurate.
                    Even on that basis alone, the regional bureaus would have problems. But I think
                    there were times when that would make quite a difference. If the bureau is
                    saying that this is what has happened, and INR is saying, well, we're not really
                    sure it happened that way, it might have happened this way, which is equally
                    plausible, then the bureaus were under the gun.</p>

                        particular thing, Central America, that whatever was coming out of the CIA
                        went through the Casey machine. In other words, this was not an intelligence
                        agency sitting down weighing the evidence and saying this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Oh, I think it was highly politicized at that time. I know that our
                    people always worked very...you know, analysts work with other agencies, they
                    call each other, they talk to each other. Certainly we understood that the
                    analysts over in the agency weren't terribly happy with what seemed to be coming
                    out of the top. It wasn't exactly what it was they started at the bottom, but
                    that's always going to be the case. In any event, I think it was much stronger
                    during those years.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Well, occasionally, yes. Because there was no fighting, or crises at

                <p>BELLOCCHI: As I recall, the reporting that we were doing on the Falkland issue
                    was quite objective, and that is sort of a “pox on both of them.” The Argentines
                    were like Don Quixote, and the Brits were not holier than thou by any stretch of
                    the imagination. I mean, sinking that ship and so forth...</p>

                    in any event, but I think in that case it sort of put a “pox on both houses”
                    type of thing. Both of you are doing the wrong things, but straight reporting
                    pretty much. I don't think we undercut either of the bureaus in that sense. I
                    think we were more just reporting as it is and the bureaus had to explain it. I
                    had the sense the administration itself was sort of caught in that one, a little
                    bit unsure of itself.</p>

                <p>BELLOCCHI: I think the INR position on Libya was that it was more of a loose

                    it was also a problem for the Soviets.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Yes. What Qadhafi was doing was not dancing at the end of a Soviet
                    line. The Soviets themselves were more stuck with someone like Qadhafi because
                    he could do some of the things they wanted as long he kept churning the waters
                    in Africa. He was fine for the Soviet Union in that sense, but they were uneasy
                    because they didn't know what the devil the man was going to do. I think,
                    especially Mr. Casey at the top, was much more wanting to show that he was
                    performing a function on behalf of the Soviets. Whereas I think INR's view was
                    that he was doing things that the Soviets were not opposed to, but they did not
                    have that close a control over what he was doing.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: The difference there was to what degree is Libya dancing to the Soviet
                    tune, and the view in INR was that he was doing a lot of things independently of
                    the Soviet Union. He was doing what he thought was in Libya's interest. He was a
                    loose cannon.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were at a time when the Middle East was really boiling
                        over. The thing that started everything was the Israeli invasion of Lebanon
                        which really turned...in the first place, we'll focus first on Israel.
                        Israel has always been a problem for the Department of State, or any other
                        government agency because of the very strong Jewish lobby which means that
                        things leak. Congress gets very upset if they think they're going to lose
                        the Jewish vote. How did INR look at Israel? Were we getting good
                        information?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: I think it was good information, but I think it wasn't so much...at
                    least in INR, the political differences within the country over whether or not
                    we should be supporting Israel, or to what degree we should, etc. I think there
                    were differences even within INR, but they were really fundamental intelligence
                    differences, analysts differences, that some would put in an analysis that
                    really shows the rationale for what the thinking was in Tel Aviv. And then there
                    were those who were putting in analysis on what the thinking was in Lebanon at
                    that time. And I think there were differences even within INR on some of those
                    issues. I think our real focus, though, was more on the Lebanon civil war
                    itself. There, I think, we really got into serious problems.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: To be perfectly honest, I can't remember what CIA's thrust was on a
                    lot of these, although I don't think they were too different. I just remember
                    because it caused a considerable heart burn in INR with the Marines being in
                    Lebanon during the civil war. They went there as a peace force.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: First they went in just to help evacuate the PLO, then
                        after the Sabra-Shatila massacres by the Israeli's sponsored Christian
                        Militia, Palestinian families, we put them back in in sort of an amorphous
                        role.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Yes, and that was the problem. I think the administration and the
                    bureau was supporting very strongly the idea that they stay there. That they
                    were a symbol of our involvement, our withdrawal of them would cause all kinds
                    of problems. INR took the view that they should be out of there, that they were
                    a sitting duck, and that they had performed the original function they went in
                    there with, and we should get them out because they were in a dangerous
                    position. But the Department would not budge on that issue.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: I don't know whether that was the factor behind it. I really don't
                    know, but certainly they were against withdrawing the Marines, and we were
                    continually peppering them with analyses, that they were in a dangerous
                    situation, they should be withdrawn. And then it happened.</p>

                <p>BELLOCCHI: The thing that I'll always remember about that, is how quiet we trod
                    the halls of the State Department for two or three weeks until all of that died
                    down. There's nothing worse than to say, I told you so. Nothing worse than to be
                    right. Everybody had to walk with great care during that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a little about this Lebanese thing. It's very
                        confusing for everybody, including the Lebanese and Israelis. Did you find
                        that you were getting a lot of information from the Israeli intelligence
                        which you had to treat with great caution?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: No. We had some real pros, and I think some of them are still there on
                    the Middle East in INR, mainly because that conflict is going on for so long. I
                    think usually the Israelis think the State Department is anti-Israel anyway. And
                    the reason is, I think, that they really did make an assessment on the kind of
                    intelligence they were getting from the Israeli intelligence to be sure they
                    weren't being boondoggled into doing something. So no, I don't think INR was
                    overly influenced by Israeli intelligence. I think they took whatever they said
                    seriously enough to want to look into it, but they didn't accept it carte
                    blanche.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Defense Intelligence Agency, DIA? For that

                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Well, in general to be perfectly frank, they were kind of dismissed in
                    anything except how many cannons does so and so have. They call it the order of
                    battle. The order of battle we would have to pretty much accept what they were
                    giving, but once they would get the least bit into politics, they were just
                    dismissed. They were not considered serious political analysts.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they come on strong in their political analyses?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Not really, but they would come in with their own view which people
                    simply wouldn't...in terms of national estimates you wouldn't see that because
                    the national estimates on political issues of that kind were normally given to
                    one of the other agencies, and if there was a national estimate that dealt with
                    military capability, it wasn't INR that had to do the major fighting, it was the
                    CIA versus DIA and we were sort of on the side line. But there were times when
                    we would inject ourselves, as small as we were. I remember a case where there
                    was some concern about Soviet MiGs, advance model MiGs, in India, and that
                    suddenly they did not seem to be where they normally were. I think it may have
                    been DIA that started the thing that they must be up to something against
                    Pakistan. At that time Pakistan's work on nuclear capability had already begun.
                    So there was great speculation that the Indians were about to take after
                    Pakistan's nuclear facilities. We only had a couple of people who were photo
                    analysts, and they came from whatever organization that is that does the
                    analyzing of photos, but they were in INR. They were on loan to INR, so I guess
                    they caught the fervor of criticizing what comes from other intelligence
                    agencies. And they looked and looked and they couldn't go along with this
                    analysis, and it kept coming up in the NID, the National Intelligence Daily,
                    that's put out by the agency. It kept coming up that there's big concern, and
                    our little blurbs and our little typewritten pages at the bottom were always
                    saying that there's some doubt that this was the case. There were all these
                    reasons, there was cloud covering, you couldn't see it very clearly, all these
                    things. And then finally one day the fellow from that photo group in INR comes
                    rushing into the front office with a photo, and he said, “Look at that little
                    tiny needle sticking out of that hangar. That's a MiG. They are still there,
                    they never left.” So we were able to dismantle that whole idea by just that one
                    little guy looking at that little needle sticking out in the hangar, and saying,
                    “No, they haven't moved. They've just been pushed inside the hangar.” These are
                    the things that made us proud.</p>
                <p>There was another thing that made INR very proud. I'll always remember Peter
                    Burleigh, I think he's just been selected ambassador to some place, but was DAS
                    for Personnel. He was then in INR, and Vice President Bush...I think the King of
                    Nepal or someone like that had come, and as you know, the White House gets
                    people to go over to the White House lawn to welcome the visitor. And Peter went
                    over because I think he'd been in that area. He wound up standing right next to
                    Vice President Bush, so Bush introduced himself, and Peter introduced himself
                    from INR. And the Vice President, who reads the Secretary's morning summary all
                    the time, said, “Oh, you're from that organization that puts out the Secretary's
                    morning summary.” And Peter felt like somehow disappearing into the grass
                    because at that time we were really differing with policy on the Middle East.
                    And he said, “You really do differ with us on the Middle East.” And that's when
                    Peter said, “Oh, Christ, what am I doing here?” George Bush said to him, “Don't
                    stop writing. We disagree with you but we need that kind of analysis. You just
                    keep right on writing what you think.” And Peter sort of floated back to the
                    Department to tell us in INR what he'd just been through. It was very nice.</p>

                        charged out rather quickly, but how did he relate to INR, as a military
                        man?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: He had a respect for INR's product although I think that he put much
                    more weight on what was coming out of the agency than he did on INR. Shultz put
                    a lot of credence into what was coming out of INR. In fact, he read the morning
                    summary every day in the car on his way to work. Security people would pick it
                    up, and he read that first thing before he'd read anything from the agency. But
                    not Alexander Haig. I think he took it all in, but he been accustomed to that.
                    He didn't make that much of an impression other than you had no doubts of where
                    he stood on an issue. If you sent something up he didn't like, he would scratch
                    all over the margin to let you know how badly he thought it was. Shultz would
                    never write, it would be so unusual that everybody would talk about the fact
                    there were some few words written on the margins by Shultz. Alexander Haig's
                    attraction that everybody wanted to hear about everyday, was what he said at his
                    staff meeting because he was so open. Here was a large staff meeting which he
                    had every day, with people from all over the place, and he would just talk so
                    openly about everything, including personalities or anything else, and how dumb
                    he thought this guy was, and then, of course, the next day needless to say it
                    was in the Washington Post. But it didn't seem to bother him at all.</p>

                        Did you feel that at all from where you were? You had a sort of peculiar

                        rapidly, Richard Allen. And then you had Judge Clark, McFarlane,

                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: They were much more involved with policy people than with the
                    intelligence. I've since felt them a great deal more, but in that particular
                    job, no, they would not get into that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: The major issue that I can recall was the delivery of weapons to the
                    Afghan rebels.</p>

                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Stingers were the big issue at that time. INR by and large, as I
                    recall, was critical of the passing of Stingers on to them because we were
                    reporting that some of them were finding their way down into places like India
                    and Pakistan. It was an operational thing that was being conducted by the
                    intelligence community in which INR was not playing any role. Since we don't
                    have any money, we never get involved in those things. We can only report on
                    them. I think that by and large we were critical that this thing was beginning
                    to get out of hand. I think we were also obliquely critical of the method that
                    was being used, which was largely to depend on the Pakistani to take delivery
                    and pass them up to the Afghanis that they wanted to get. So there was quite a
                    bit of reporting on that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Our main subject was the Soviet Union. And the Soviet
                        Union was within, by the time you left, five or six years of collapse,
                        absolute collapse, and yet the intelligence community—I'm talking about the
                        full intelligence communities—somehow wasn't picking this up. Or maybe
                        nobody was picking this up. What were you getting from the Soviet Union at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: I think most of them was acceptance of the analysis being put out by
                    the large agencies. After all, if you wander over to Langley, or out to Fort
                    Meade, or places like that, you'll hear our 120 analysts...</p>

                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: All of that, the electronic intelligence, as well as the human, all of
                    this thing, there was such an enormous number of people covering these areas.
                    You know our analysts for the Soviet Union, of our 120 maybe numbered 10 to 15.
                    We were in a different category entirely so we had to accept an awful lot. I
                    think our better area was the fact that we had two or three Eastern European
                    experts in there who did a lot more reporting on the problems of the Eastern
                    European countries in those days. I can't remember us being that much involved
                    in saying that the economy ain't as strong as it used to be, because we simply
                    had to rely on other intelligence.</p>

                        the hotels.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: That's economic, that's where we failed, really on the economy because
                    they had a lot of troops, there's no question of that, and weapons being shipped
                    all over the world. But where nobody seemed to sense this, that it was all based
                    on a soft economy which was about ready to collapse and nobody could tell.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: The military just bamboozled everybody by its enormity, but the fact
                    that they were maintaining that thing at such great economic expense they
                    couldn't afford to keep up, didn't really come across.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that INR had much of an economic filament to
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: No. To answer your question we were organized within INR just as the
                    State Department is organized. We had little offices for each region, and then
                    you had some functional offices—economic was one of them, and global issues was
                    another, for example. But no, our numbers were far too small. The economic
                    office probably had four or five analysts at the maximum to cover the whole
                    world. You really had to rely a great deal on everything that was being filed
                    from elsewhere. Only rarely could you get back a wait a minute, I think this may
                    be going off, type of report. I had a meeting with the office directors of each
                    one of the regional and functional offices every morning, and decided what it is
                    that we should give the Secretary. These directors, by and large, were very
                    good. We had a mixture, maybe they still do, of Civil Service and Foreign
                    Service people. We were very pleased to have that mixture giving us continuity
                    and freshness flowing through INR all the time. But it was the Civil Service
                    people who had been there for years that could stand back a little bit and say,
                    wait a minute, look at the long term trend of this thing, and then inject that
                    into the daily current analysis that was being done. The Book, as we called the
                    Secretary's morning summary, really was the center piece of our reporting,
                    although we sent a lot of memos up to the Secretary on individual matters as
                    well. The Book was prepared seven days a week. It went to the Secretary first
                    thing in the morning, as I said. It was six pages long, the first three pages
                    were called the front of the book, and these were little items of intelligence
                    news. I would say, I'll give you an inch to tell him what the news is, and one
                    inch to tell him why it is he should be reading it. So it was two inches for
                    each item, there would be four or five on a page, and there would be three pages
                    of those. And then there would be three one page analyses in more depth on any
                    particular issue that was going on, called the back of the book. So in the
                    morning meetings that we had, we would decide on what issues: one, what pieces
                    of intelligence were important enough for the Secretary to know; and two, what
                    were the three pieces of analysis we should be giving him in a little greater
                    depth. Each page in the back of the book had a little summary at the top. So you
                    talk about really shrinking an issue down so it fit in one page, and then
                    further shrink it so that little paragraph at the top would tell the Secretary,
                    here's an important issue that you should focus on. It was very good for us. I
                    find that even today in my work, going out to Taipei for example, spending two
                    weeks talking with the leadership, all of the leaders of the country in all the
                    different areas, business, academic, as well as government, and then coming back
                    and sitting down and writing the report that you're much more able to stand
                    back, you don't get mixed up in that daily thing, stand back and say, where is
                    it going? That was the constant theme.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: No. I think that probably more gets to the regional bureaus than it
                    does to INR. If it dealt with something that was intelligence, of course there
                    would be a reaction trying to explain it to the upstairs. But, by and large, no,
                    we didn't get caught up in that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: The bloody battle of the IDF for Taiwan. The Indigenous Defense
                    Fighter. There were a lot of other issues dealing with that, but that's one I
                    remember because I've always been interested in the China-Taiwan... I always
                    remember one thing that came up was the battle over the IDF, whether or not we
                    should sell Taiwan the technology to build its own defense fighter. For years
                    they had been stamping their feet that they needed a more up-to-date defense
                    fighter. They were still flying 104s and F5s, and they wanted the F-16s. This
                    was 1983, around there, '83-'84 time period, and it wasn't until ten years later
                    that they finally got the F-16s. But in the meantime there was this proposal
                    that we would transfer sufficient technology, in a sufficiently controlled
                    environment, for them to produce their own. It was a very, very bitter struggle
                    coming after the 1982 communique in which we had promised the PRC that we would
                    gradually, over a period of time, reduce our arms sale to Taiwan. With that in
                    mind, of course, Taiwan was really very concerned about the whole idea that they
                    could maintain their defenses as a basis for some confidence, in one day being
                    able to sit down and discuss the future with the Mainland. So there was a policy
                    struggle that went on for some time. But the analysis that would come up to me
                    on that really made me very unhappy. After all, some of our people in INR,
                    Foreign Service people, are influenced by the fact that one day they're going to
                    have to go back to the policy bureaus. They know where policy is running, and
                    sometimes they might want to lean in the direction of policy. I remember getting
                    one analysis saying this was a very serious matter, that the IDF fighter planes
                    over Taiwan would be a provocation that the Mainland would never accept, and
                    therefore it was very dangerous to go forward with this proposal. After reading
                    that, I passed it on with some editing and discussion with the analyst—you
                    always had to discuss with the analyst, you never edited anything without
                    discussing it with the analyst—and then it went on to the director as a memo to
                    the Secretary. I didn't think too much of it then until the next day, when I got
                    another memo on the same subject. It was a little warning signal saying, whoops,
                    wait a minute, what's up here, there's something more in this than I had read in
                    yesterday's memo. Sure enough, there was this big battle going on over in EAP,
                    over whether or not they should do it. So then I read it with a different
                    thought in mind. Why is this coming up at this time? I had agreed the day before
                    that if an F-16 type was suddenly crossing the PRC radar screen over there and
                    they were watching it, they would get quite excited. So I went over to our PM
                    office, which doesn't get mixed up in all these emotional...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Political-Military Affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: ...and sat down and said, “What's all this business about?” And they
                    said, “Oh, good heavens, this is something like the Lavi arrangement with the
                    Israelis. The Israelis have been at this thing for years, and it's going to be
                    years before the Taiwanese are going to have an airplane flying over.” Then I
                    began to realize, that I had been a little bit bamboozled by this one. I was
                    picturing an IDF flying over Taiwan's skies next week if we agreed to it. So
                    then I took a different tact entirely, went to the director and I said, “There's
                    a lot of hyperbole in this kind of analysis. This is not taking place now, this
                    is a technology transfer issue. It's not a political issue of having a fighter
                    plane over Taiwan's skies that quickly.” That was close to the time when I was
                    about to leave INR. There had been changes in INR by that time and I think not
                    very much happiness that I was not going to allow supportive analysis that we
                    should not do the IDF. Doubtless those that did not agree were just as happy I
                    was about ready to leave. I think internal opposition made INR leadership more
                    careful. So the issue in INR was a little bit tempered for a while, but I don't
                    know what took place after that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The dynamics behind this was, was it sort of internalized
                        with some of the analysis within INR?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: I think it was more individuals. The analyst that was putting this out
                    was very much a product of the long struggle over recognition of the PRC, and
                    the director at that time was someone who tentatively favored that view also,
                    and I was sort of in the middle between my desk officer on one hand, and the
                    director on the other. But I simply couldn't accept it. We would be putting out
                    analysis that in my view was misleading. And then I got the PM people, our
                    Pol-Mil office, to also send up analysis on this issue as a way of trying to
                    counter this kind of thing. It was an interesting period of time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really what you're pointing out is, this is a time when
                        you might say we were enthralled with our relations with China. And in a way
                        we were sort of dismissing Taiwan.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: It's also that, but, Stu, there was also the fact that the INR
                    director—I'm not going to get into names now—the INR director had changed, and
                    once you have a Foreign Service officer in that slot, let's face it, Foreign
                    Service people are policy-oriented. I see that even in our operation here where
                    all our Foreign Service officers are saying, “We're not supposed to get into
                    policy, you're supposed to implement policy in this job.” They find it very
                    difficult because that's what they're born and raised to do, implement policy.
                    So when you have a Foreign Service person in that job, there is a natural
                    inclination to try to use intelligence analysis for purposes of supporting
                    policy. And that was the change. It's always going to be the case I'm afraid.
                    But the idea that the Secretary of State should get a second opinion from INR
                    started in the days of George Marshall. Every Secretary of State ever since has
                    always accepted that there should be a second opinion. I think it's been very,
                    very valuable, but it's always under attack by virtue of the fact that Foreign
                    Service people just have this natural bent to try to take that and use that to
                    support one policy or another.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left INR and what did you move to then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Then I became the ambassador to Botswana. I frankly didn't know where
                    Botswana was. When I got the call...in those days Reagan used to call up
                    himself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you known your name was put forward, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Yes, I think I had known only a short time before, because I think
                    you're offered the opportunity to say no, no, I'll never take it, I won't do it.
                    But I hadn't, and I got the call from Reagan and then I knew, in fact, that he
                    wanted to appoint me. And I went to the library in the State Department to look
                    up Botswana, and the only book in the State Department library was a Ph.D.
                    thesis written by somebody in the UK that described a little group of Afrikaners
                    who had migrated up into Western Botswana, close to the border of Namibia, and
                    had thrived, and were there today as citizens of Botswana. And that was all, the
                    only thing that was in the library about Botswana. Eventually I had to start
                    looking into Bechuanaland because that's what the British name for that area was
                    before, and even so, there was very little on it. So I must say, my wife and I
                    both, left for Botswana after going through that process of becoming an
                    ambassador. Even if it's for a small country, like Botswana, it is really an
                    experience you never, never forget. It's quite an honor. I don't care what
                    country it is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the first place, how does one get ready? You're saying
                        you really didn't know much, but there must have been somebody on the desk
                        who could...</hi>

                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Oh, sure, they start to give you briefing papers, and all that kind of
                    thing. They prepare you for your hearings. But that had to wait for a little bit
                    until we got the agr�ment, but that was not a controversial assignment by any
                    means. And then I went up before the Congress, Senator Kassebaum was then the
                    chair of the subcommittee. So we got through without any problems, but there was
                    still the process of getting sworn in. I don't care what country it is, big or
                    small, it's still quite an impressive thing. Then going off to Botswana. My wife
                    and I both were really going there with some concern. I mean, we'd never even
                    thought about Africa before. It was completely out of our area, and we didn't
                    know really what to expect. We were pleasantly surprised. It was a fascinating
                    assignment. It was somewhat important because of the South Africans at that time
                    who were acting up, and raiding across the border into Botswana sometimes. And
                    believe it or not, it was one of the few times that Secretary Shultz ever wrote
                    anything in the margin of anything on where he stood, was that he liked Botswana
                    because Madame Chiepe, the Foreign Minister, had been in to see him and told him
                    a little bit about democratic Botswana, and what they were doing, and how they
                    were being pushed by the South Africans into directions that were counter to the
                    democratic principles that they had adopted, and he just loved it. He absolutely
                    loved it, and from then on he said, “That's a country I like.” In fact when he
                    was supposed to take his first swing through Africa, Botswana was a place he was
                    coming to, to give a talk about democracy in Africa. We had already started to
                    prepare for the visit when Reagan suddenly announced that he was meeting
                    Gorbachev at Reykjavik up in Iceland, and Shultz was pulled off his African
                    trip. So he missed it. We all had recommended it, and he had very gladly
                    accepted the idea. There is not enough hotel space for the entourage of the
                    Secretary there, but he was going to stop in the morning, have a lunch and give
                    a speech, and then that afternoon leave for some other place in Africa. So we
                    were so excited about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: From '85 to '88.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived in '85 in Botswana, what was the
                        political-economic situation? Tell me a little about Botswana.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Well, Botswana is a country that's larger than France in size, but
                    it's only got a million plus people, and a lot of it is desert, huge areas are
                    game parks—two of the largest game parks in Africa are there that are still
                    relatively untouched by the tourists. Chobi, up in the north, and the Okavango
                    swamp area which is very, very fascinating. But then down closer to the South
                    African border, it was a little more developed. Botswana had built a road that
                    went all the way up north close to the Victoria Falls area which is in Zimbabwe.
                    There was some industry, but the country largely depended on the diamonds, the
                    largest producer of gem diamonds in the world, larger than South Africa. But
                    they were very, very lucky. They found the diamonds just about the time they
                    were getting their independence. So they negotiated with the De Beers
                    organization as a country, and wound up with over 50% of the income from the
                    mines. It would belong to Botswana, and then they joined the De Beers
                    distribution system. But because of that they have laws saying that the mines
                    must be exploited in their entirety, not just where the very best diamonds are.
                    That didn't happen in Namibia, and DeBeers was able to mine all the best
                    diamonds on their own, leaving just the secondary to what is left today in
                    Namibia. But in Botswana it was all done very properly. It's a clean government,
                    corruption free. The money they earn from their diamonds actually goes into the
                    treasury, so they're quite rich actually. But as a country, not individuals. The
                    president, as a matter of fact, was always in debt, and had to keep working
                    himself out of debt. So it is a very open society. They have an active
                    opposition party. They have regular elections. The speaker of their Unicameral
                    Assembly was white, as was one other member of the cabinet. There were no racial
                    problems, there were no ethnic problems within the country. That had all been
                    erased by the original president, Seretse Khama, who was the prince of one of
                    the tribes down there. He was educated in England and married a British girl. In
                    those days he was not permitted to go back to Botswana by the British. It took
                    several years but when he got back there, he was elected the first president,
                    and started the whole democratic system. We loved the country. The people were
                    friendly. Foreigners were actually welcomed. And on occasion if you wanted to go
                    down to the big city, you could get in a car and drive, only four hours to
                    Johannesburg. The capital was right on the border, and we could fly down there
                    in an hour as well.</p>
                <p>But when you first started, we'd go down there about once a month for shopping in
                    the malls. As time went on you find yourself going down there less and less, and
                    toward the end, why go down there, you can get everything you need here, you
                    look a little harder but...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is during the time of...was it constructive
                        engagement with South Africa where we had still the Reagan administration
                        which was considered to be not as confrontational with South Africa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: They opposed sanctions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling from Botswana, and your role, and how
                        did you feel about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Well, I think the fact that Botswana was a democracy made it easy to
                    go back with the views of the leaders of Botswana. They were also—what were they
                    called, the Front Line. We got quite a bit on how the Front Line movement was
                    proceeding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Front Line movement being the states surrounding South
                        Africa, which were black states.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: The black states to the north of South Africa, all of whom had to
                    depend on South Africa's economy because they had no other way of running their
                    economy except through South Africa. So they were in the delicate position of
                    depending on South Africa, but opposing South Africa's policies of apartheid. So
                    it was an interesting time to be reporting from there, but clearly they favored
                    sanctions even though it was going to be counterproductive to their own economy.
                    They were a little reluctant to shout too much, but they were certainly
                    supportive of sanctions. During those days we'd get visits from many members of
                    Congress. Two people who are still in the Senate, Senator Simon and Senator
                    Kassebaum, one Republican and one Democrat, went to South Africa, and then
                    stopped in Gaborone. I remember Senator Simon telling the president, “The air is
                    different up here. It's just like coming home.” And Kassebaum made exactly the
                    same kind of observation. “It really is in the air, you can sense it. Down there
                    you had that apartheid system, you move into Botswana, such an open place.” They
                    really felt comfortable. So we had a lot of people that were supportive of the
                    Front Line states, and once the veto was overridden, and sanctions were applied,
                    it made quite a difference down there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the American senate who passed sanctions over the
                        veto. Congress passed it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: What I thought was very satisfying was when the people down there in
                    Botswana, but I think in the other countries in that area as well, commented on
                    our imposing sanctions and saying, “Yes, but your administration is against it.
                    It really doesn't mean anything.” Our response that, “On the contrary. It's the
                    law of the land and we will have to observe it”, impressed them. And Reagan
                    himself made that point, while he opposed it, it's now the law and it will be
                    implemented. That was very nice. I thought that they were very impressed down
                    there with the fact that we are a country of laws. It was a good lesson for
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it difficult for you—I mean you were the new boy on
                        the block as far as Africa is concerned, but you were representing the
                        American President, who was more friendly towards the South African regime
                        than many of the policy makers as represented by the vote. Was this an
                        uncomfortable position to be in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: It wasn't easy to argue but at least in my case, the Botswanans are so
                    nice that they didn't try to embarrass me, but you did have to make the case
                    that constructive engagement was the way to go. In fact, it wasn't completely
                    lost on people like the Botswana because they had to depend on the South African
                    economy. So they didn't want something that would hurt them very badly. They
                    wanted their economy to keep going, but they wanted sufficient pressure on South
                    Africa to change the system. So it was somewhat equivocal, they didn't beat the
                    table and say, “That's nonsense, you've got to be strong and fight them.” The
                    further north you got, like Zambia, the stronger they got on these things. Right
                    next to the border, they were a little more careful about the way they
                    proceeded.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any reflections from our embassy in Cape
                        Town and Pretoria about how they felt about the situation at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: I can't remember, he was a political appointee. He left, I remember he
                    was recalled at one point, and then Ed Perkins came down. Ed was there for most
                    of the time that I was up in Botswana and we'd talk to each other on the phone,
                    visited, etc. I can recount a little story, a little anecdote I thought was
                    clever. When Frank Wisner left the front office, that was the time he went to
                    Egypt, I think, as ambassador, Chas Freeman came in to replace him in the front
                    office in the Africa Bureau. And down in Gaborone one day I got a call from the
                    Foreign Ministry close to midnight. Mind you, this is little Botswana, and that
                    was really something. They asked me if I would come over, and there was the
                    Foreign Minister and the Permanent Secretary. They said there were a lot of
                    military movements going on across the border, the border being only six Kms
                    away from where we were sitting at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Six kilometers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: And they said there was a lot of military movement going on over
                    there, and they said while there was not much love lost between the South
                    African military and the Botswana military people, there was always a tacit
                    understanding that if they were going to go through exercises close to the
                    border, that they would somehow get the word that that's what it was all about.
                    They had heard nothing at all. All of this movement going on at this time of the
                    night, made them afraid South Africa was planning another raid into Botswana.”
                    So this was midnight and I went back to the embassy, but you know, our embassy
                    was small, it really did shut down at night. For me to call the commo fellow to
                    come over would take about two hours to warm up the machine before he could send
                    a cable off. I was in much more of a hurry than that. So I called by open line,
                    even though we were convinced at that time that the South Africans were
                    monitoring these open lines.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sometimes it's handy.</hi>

                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: So I called by open line and got Chas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about the acting head of the African
                        Bureau.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: He was the senior deputy at that time. And sure enough he was still at
                    work, it was about 7:00-7:30 in the evening in Washington. I said, “I've got a
                    message here, so I guess the best thing for me to do is for me to speak
                    Mandarin.” Chas is a Chinese language officer. So I conveyed the message in
                    Mandarin to Chas in Washington. We talked back and forth, and then he called Ed
                    Perkins by phone back down to Pretoria and saying, “You better get over to the
                    Foreign Office, and say just how unhappy we would be if something like this
                    materialized.” Which he did. The Permanent Secretary in the South African
                    Foreign Office didn't know anything about it because the military and the
                    Foreign Office didn't always discuss things with each other. So he had to
                    inquire, but eventually was able to confirm that it was just an exercise. The
                    word came back through that way to Botswana. But the idea that we had to
                    communicate in Mandarin from Botswana was one for the books.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With the South Africans listening, up the wall.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: They must have wondered if something really funny was up. At any rate
                    it got the job done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The South Africans have an ambassador there, didn't they?
                        Or a commissioner?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: No, they didn't even have relations. The two sides would meet on
                    occasion, and it was always between Pik Botha the South African Foreign
                    Minister, and Madame Chiepe, the Botswanan Foreign Minister. Botha was a very
                    rough guy, and Madame Chiepe, on the contrary, is very even handed. She was a
                    school marm, that's what she was and she acted like one. That's why Shultz liked
                    her so much because she really was very calm in the way she handled matters. She
                    sort of gave a little lecture to Botha in a nice school marmish way about why he
                    was wrong in what he was saying. It would drive Botha up the wall, of course. He
                    was a completely different kind of character who wanted to beat the table, while
                    she would go back and counter his arguments each time. But, in fact, later on it
                    became clear when things did settle down that he had a great deal of respect for
                    her. But he was a great actor, and he knew how to be very gruff in the way he
                    talked, but it didn't bother the Botswanans at all. They knew the Afrikaners
                    just as well as anyone else did. So they held their ground very well. There was
                    a great deal of respect between them. I think there was also a great deal of
                    concern because Botswana was a free democracy, and the argument the Afrikaners
                    always used was that Africans were uncivilized. It just didn't apply. In
                    Zimbabwe the same thing applied eventually. Mugabe, when he became president,
                    managed the country reasonably well. So that kind of undercut Afrikaner
                    arguments.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Oh, always. That goes without saying, of course, because the ANC would
                    also not hesitate to use Botswana. There were ANC people coming in and out of
                    Botswana all the time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ANC was the African National Congress.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Even their military on occasion. They would go into South Africa via
                    Botswana on many occasions. It's a big border, and open. Cows would walk across
                    the border so why couldn't people, and they did.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Oh, sure. I've even had some, including the present vice president of
                    South Africa, come to a reception I gave in Botswana.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our relationship with ANC in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: I think most of the time it was standoffish because they were supposed
                    to have a connection with the Soviets. In fact, the vice president of the ANC,
                    was a white fellow who was a communist. So you can tell our intelligence
                    certainly focused on the ANC, and much less so on the South African military.
                    That didn't mean that we couldn't meet with ANC on occasion, which we did.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: No, they were not. Occasionally they would come to Botswana. They came
                    to a reception, I think it was one of the Fourth of July receptions they were
                    there. They didn't view us as friends, but they didn't view us as enemies
                    either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Diamonds occupying the major part of the economy, I take
                        it then that our commercial ties, economic ties, weren't very
                        important.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: We had an AID program going on there. The composition of the mission,
                    while the embassy itself was small, there was an AID mission that was largely
                    dealing in PL 480 products. They also had some health programs, and family
                    planning, and some of these other things. So there was a small AID program, and
                    then we had almost 200 Peace Corps people in Botswana.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That must have been rather pleasant duty. I'm not knocking
                        it, but it sounds like a really nice place.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: I must say I was a little bit wary because they were scattered all
                    over the country, and in order to see all the Peace Corps people, you really had
                    to have a small airplane. You couldn't get in to some of these places, and here
                    were some of our people in very isolated areas all by themselves in some small
                    village in Botswana. But we very seldom had any problems with people stealing,
                    or anything of that nature, very, very few. It was clearly quite a nice
                    atmosphere, people welcomed them, and I think our Peace Corps people felt very
                    satisfied because of that. They were welcomed into the classrooms to teach
                    without any problems. The head of the Peace Corps would visit, and I'd fly
                    around with her to all these little outposts in the country.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: I think not. They were interesting to us largely because of their
                    democratic system, and the lack of corruption. I think these were the things
                    that really stood out.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Lack of tribal problems, no racial problems. It was a fantastic
                    assignment. We really enjoyed it very much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left in '88?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: I left in '88 and I spent two years at the Industrial College as I
                    think it's called, as the Foreign Service type that's over there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, then we'll pick that up at that point then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Today is the 1st of August 1995. Nat you were at the Industrial College from when
                    to when?</p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Industrial War College. Let's see, back from Botswana from '88 to
                    '90.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What does the Industrial College...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: It's sort of a partner to the War College. It's supposed, I guess, to
                    put greater emphasis on the supply side of the military. But it's a shame in
                    some sense because they're right next to each other. They really probably could
                    join forces a lot more than they do. I mean, having a separate economic
                    department, and separate political science department, I think is kind of a
                    waste. There's been a resistance to making it a real national defense university
                    in which the different schools become a university, once you do combine these
                    different departments. But overall, though, it was a good experience. The best
                    part of the job frankly is seeing these fairly young colonels coming in from all
                    the different services, and the attitudes they have towards the State
                    Department, and Foreign Service generally, and how they changed over the course
                    of the year. When they first came in to the school, their attitude was one of,
                    why are these traitors being allowed in the building? And by the time they are
                    graduating, they have accepted that the U.S. government is a broad government,
                    and everyone has their own role, and that while the military is there to prepare
                    for war, the Foreign Service objective is to try to avoid it. That was heart
                    warming really, to see that kind of change take place in the two years that I
                    spent there.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>But other than that, from a personal standpoint, I really had a tough time. I
                    think throughout my entire Foreign Service career I've never had a job that I
                    didn't find interesting and challenging, except that one. I guess that if I had
                    been prepared after Botswana to say, okay, it's time to leave the Foreign
                    Service, and this would be a good way to adjust to my departure, I think I would
                    have enjoyed it. It gave me ample time to do a lot of things that one would like
                    to do, and probably even prepare yourself for the future. But I wasn't in that
                    frame of mind, so I kind of bridled always at what for me was relative
                    inactivity. I mean being a professor in a college...we all look at it and say,
                    gee, that must be pretty nice. But for someone that likes to be busy and
                    challenged, it's not all that great. That was the unfortunate part about it. I
                    wish it could have come either later, or I wish I could have been better
                    prepared myself mentally for those two years. As always, you learn something, so
                    I don't regret those last couple of years, but I was really pleased when I could
                    transfer over to this job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, so let's talk about the job you have. Before we get
                        there, did you get a feel for how the military...I mean you were there
                        during basically the fall of the Soviet Union.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: There was a significant change in Gorbachev at that stage. I don't
                    think it was seen then as a falling apart of the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because all of a sudden the military had to look around
                        for another gratification. Not to be facetious about it, but that's what
                        military does. But you weren't getting that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: No we didn't, at least on the industrial side, didn't put a great deal
                    of emphasis on how do you fight the Soviet attitude. It was more, how do you
                    prepare, not only the military, but the country for mobilization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So in '90 you moved over to what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: To the chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan. Because
                        we're doing this for the historical record, could you explain the background
                        to this, and then what it encompasses.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Technically speaking, as you know, the TRA, Taiwan Relations Act, in
                    fact legalized the establishment of the American Institute in Taiwan to conduct
                    the unofficial relations between the people of the United States and the people
                    of Taiwan. It actually began just before the TRA was actually passed.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: 1979. The treasurer of the corporation told me that he opened the bank
                    account for the American Institute in Taiwan with one penny. He always likes to
                    tell that story. Our account with the Riggs Bank was opened with one penny, but
                    eventually we got money from Congress to get the Institute going. We have this
                    office here which is the headquarters of a private non-profit corporation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're speaking in Rosslyn, just across the Potomac from
                        the Kennedy Center, and the Department of State.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: So, in fact, some people wanted to say we must in appearances be
                    separated from the Department of State, which we were until about two years ago
                    when the Office of the Inspector General moved into this building and this
                    became SA-39 but we don't advertise the fact that we're in the same building as
                    the State Department. It's very unique, and I found it a very innovative way of
                    carrying on a relationship that has everything that any relationship we have
                    with any country has except the name.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you give a thumbnail sketch of the history on how this
                        organization developed up to the time you took it over in 1990? It obviously
                        was a strange creature.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Yes, it remains that way, strange. It was started relatively small. We
                    had the headquarters here which is supposed to act as sort of a State Department
                    side, and then the branch office out in Taipei is an embassy in everything but
                    name. They were to report to their headquarters here, and in fact it flows
                    through to the Department from us. The system works fine except in policy
                    matters. The U.S. government must maintain complete control over policy, so the
                    State Department lays down the policy. We implement it in effect. And the man
                    out in the branch office in Taipei under normal circumstances would be an
                    ambassador, and his recommendations and reporting and all the same thing that
                    goes on, normally, goes on there. This office here, the headquarters, is more
                    the administrative headquarters with the money coming in via Washington, we
                    redisperse it out to the branch office, and most of the money goes out there.
                    That's where most of our people are. So that is what maintains this office here,
                    this job. It has other elements, not just supporting the branch office in
                    Taipei. We are responsible for the money that we're getting. We have public
                    affairs activity because the State Department doesn't conduct public affairs for
                    our relationship with the people in Taiwan. I go around the country speaking
                    largely to Chinese-American associations all the time.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>And then probably more important than anything is liaison with the Taiwan
                    representative here which I do on almost a daily basis. I'm the liaison with
                    State on a daily basis, the liaison with MFC, with Commerce, with Agriculture,
                    Treasury, all the others. They all flow through us here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's say you have a fast breaking situation—just recently

                        now, August 1st, our Secretary of State is meeting with the Foreign Minister
                        of the People's Republic of China because we're going through what the

                        something fast breaking, the idea of sending something to you in Rosslyn to
                        get over to the State Department...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Oh, no, no. In actual fact there are communications. That is, after
                    all, in the air somehow it winds its way straight over to the State Department
                    also.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They eavesdrop on your communications.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: There's no short-stop on that. We are here mainly in the
                    administrative sense shortstopping on occasion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What has the State Department had to deal with Taiwan?
                        They have to have something within the body of the State Department to deal
                        with Taiwan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Oh, there's the coordination office over there that would be somewhat
                    the equivalent of a desk, except that because we are here dealing as a liaison
                    with the Taiwan representative office, there doesn't have to be the same number
                    of people. But the relationship is as broad as you would find anywhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For example, can the State Department people, the
                        relations group, can they go out and have lunch with the Chinese, the
                        Taiwanese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Yes, I have lunches quite often.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're the 'beard', in a way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Yes, and I invite people on both sides.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're the cutout in a way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: We're technically, yes. And yes, that's really an important part of
                    the program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think it would be essential.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: In many ways, let's take the example, the trade negotiations. That's
                    relatively a non-controversial subject to get into. If we're negotiating a trade
                    issue, or whatever it is, GATT, or whatever it is they're negotiating, of course
                    the negotiations have to be done by USTR. We don't have the expertise to do that
                    kind of business. And the Taiwanese are the same, they don't have that kind of
                    people here in the Washington office, so people come from Taiwan, for example,
                    and we set up a meeting. And we have as our “consultants” people who come from
                    USTR. We sit them down at the table, and say, “Welcome to AIT, let's sit down
                    and talk trade.” And they sit down and they talk trade. If they come to some
                    kind of an agreement, they turn it over to the Taiwan representative office, and
                    to the AIT, and we write up an agreement according to the lines that they've
                    been instructed, and we sign them. It's an agreement between AIT and TECRO the
                    Taiwan representative. So that's the way things are done across the board.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suppose all we've down, the thing has been in place now
                        for what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Sixteen years. Beyond anyone's realization. I think when the TRA was
                    passed, I know that somebody that you know, gave a speech over at the War
                    College, very intimately involved in our China relations at that time...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think your talking about Chas Freeman, aren't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Who said that this thing was probably not going to be needed more than
                    about three years. Well, it's been sixteen years later. So actually by accident
                    it has survived, not only survived, but thrived. You know, we pass out, we say
                    we process more non-immigrant visas in Taipei, sometimes more than any other
                    country, but at the very minimum we are the third largest processor of NIV visas
                    in the world. I mean it's across the board. Our trade is enormous. We sell to
                    Taiwan twice as much as we sell to the PRC. I mean it's a very big
                    relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a bit about our representative's office in
                        Taipei.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: In Taipei, it's called the American Institute in Taiwan.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who staffs it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: We have a director, who in other circumstances would be the
                    ambassador. We have a deputy director who under other circumstances would be the
                    DCM. And then what we call the general affairs section, which under normal
                    circumstances would be the political section. We have an economic section, we
                    use the same words for that. We have the travel service section, which would be
                    the consular area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. You mentioned the travel services section. I'm an old
                        consular officer, and a part of consular problems, one, just visas and all,
                        which is relatively simple, but are there special provisions because the
                        visa law is set up to say, countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: The Taiwan Relations Act includes in it, or gives the AIT the
                    authority to process visas, and we are even getting the authority for passports
                    soon, because that's become...so many travelers back and forth. We did not
                    originally have that authority. The visas are still stamped as being issued in
                    Hong Kong. That clearly is not going to last very much longer. What we change it
                    to is still under discussion, but eventually that will be changed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things I take it is that you must have an
                        officer in charge of euphemisms almost.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Well, that's really one of our jobs. My deputy spends a lot of his
                    time scrubbing communications to be sure it doesn't say...oh, yes, we're a
                    laundering agent as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the important function of a consular things, and
                        that is protection of Americans. Usually you have a Consular Treaty.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: That's right, American services.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do we have with Taiwan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: We have an American Citizen Services Office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But do we have the equivalent to a treaty?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: No, we have an agreement between AIT and our counterpart on privileges
                    and immunities, and they are almost the same, but not quite the same as
                    diplomatic immunity type of thing. So that's really the thing that judges...I
                    mean our professional relationship between us and the Foreign Office there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because this is for the historical record, when you
                        say...I can never get the right term, but our office, your office in Taipei
                        is staffed, who are these people, where do they come from, and how does it
                        work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Okay, the Taiwan Relations Act has taken very good care of that. We
                    have a mixture of people, but most of them are Foreign Service people who have
                    been separated, and they are actually separated from the Foreign Service. It's a
                    very bothersome process for our personnel people in the State Department to go
                    through all the paper work that has to be done to separate them from the
                    Service. They're given a regular passport for their tour in the AIT. We in our
                    budget include all of their salaries, rents, benefits. That's why our budget is
                    as large as as it is, it's around $34 million a year, it's because it includes
                    all these things that under normal circumstances are centrally located in the
                    State Department. At an embassy the admin officer does not get the money to pay
                    people out there. Their pension checks are sent direct here at home. The rents
                    are coming out of Washington as well. That's not the case with us. We have to do
                    all of that ourselves. But we contribute to their pension fund with the TSP and
                    all the other business. So their time in service is never broken. It's smoke and
                    mirrors. We've arranged a way so that these people's service remains intact.
                    These are the bulk of the people. We do have some people from Commerce, Foreign
                    Commercial Service, and the Foreign Agriculture Service. The military is not
                    able to separate uniform military personnel, so we pick up recently retired
                    people, of course, with the cooperation of DOD, to come and work for us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They probably come out ahead on that in a way, a little
                        more selective.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: And it's not a bad deal. We have some civil service people, including
                    from the State Department, who are separated the same way. And then we have some
                    people who are direct hire. We can hire directly. So we have a whole combination
                    of people for whom we have to pay everything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at this thing institutionally, in many ways the
                        very fact that you've been here for five years now means that you have
                        probably a little better institutional stability here.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: More continuity.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...than you do in other places, which is always a...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Our people here in Washington. But the turnover out there in Taipei
                    now is very much like an overseas post, a three year assignment cycle.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there a problem there as it used to be if you served in
                        Israel you couldn't go to an Arab world?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: No, they've got American tourist passports. They can travel anywhere
                    they want.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So a service in Taiwan does not preclude their serving in
                        the PRC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Oh, no, on the contrary. We teach language students in our school in
                    Taipei, the old Language School. Most of them go to the Mainland for assignment
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Often, and I'm sure right now, there are policy
                        discussions going on. I mean the PRC is showing a propensity to export arms,
                        and to arm itself, and there is concern that this may be our next major
                        enemy...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: That's one school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, I mean it is a school so there have to be essentially
                        policy considerations about whither our relationship with these things,
                        which would mean meetings certainly between the Department of Defense and
                        the State Department and the National Security Council. What happens? Where
                        do you fit into this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Well, technically speaking, and in most part not only technically but
                    actually, policy discussions go on over at State, and once the policy is
                    decided, that's what we stand up and salute and carry out. Now, that's not to
                    say we are not asked what do you think of this, or what do you think of that.
                    But we do not have a role in the decision making. Formulating, it may be of
                    course, they will try to draw on all the expertise they can get on what they
                    think is going on here and there, especially in Taiwan, what our views are, and
                    what the reactions would be, etc. That, of course, I contribute to. But the
                    decision itself is made in government. It's got to be a USG decision.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But there has always been the thing, do we from time to
                        time at least have a Taiwan vet, I mean somebody who has been sitting there
                        in the NSC or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: You mean that kind of continuity in government?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sometimes when policy is being considered, it's not bad to
                        have somebody who knows, who has been around the block in a particular
                        country sitting over at the NSC—you're rolling your eyes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: You know, like any other service, military or anyone else, we don't
                    like to be second guessed anytime, so having someone that says, “Well, we've
                    been through this two times before, and this is the time it worked...” it isn't
                    always very appreciated. So one treads that one rather carefully.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if you'd comment a bit about how, you've been in
                        and out of this whole relationship for some time, when the Taiwan Relations
                        Act was set up, and Chas Freeman said he'd give it three years. This was
                        generally considered because, if I recall, and correct me if I'm wrong,
                        Taiwan did not seem like the greatest ally. I mean it was the end of Chiang
                        Kai-shek. Repugnant may be the wrong term, but it seemed to be two regimes,
                        the People's Republic and Taiwan both. It was very easy to have a two China
                        policy because then we got to deal with them, but we didn't like them.
                        They're not like us, but things have really changed, and I wonder if you
                        could talk a bit about your reflection on the change. Because I think this
                        is profound in what's happening.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: It is absolutely fundamental to the problems we're having right now. I
                    have to see it from the perspective of Taiwan, and some of the other people that
                    you're talking to, of course, have to look at it from the perspective of China.
                    And the PRC, there is no one that I know of, no matter how rabid a supporter of
                    Taiwan, or how rabid an anti-China person that individual is, would ever contest
                    that we should have a good relationship with the PRC. That's an important
                    relationship. No one ever contests that. But seeing it from a different
                    perspective really makes a difference. And what has happened is that our
                    policies established in the ''70s were based on the kind of two Chinas, if we
                    can use that expression, that you just talked about, and that doesn't exist
                    anymore. China, of course, has changed a great deal, but nothing compared to the
                    way Taiwan has changed. So how you deal with this set of relationships when you
                    have an authoritarian Taiwan, and how you deal with it when you have a
                    democratic Taiwan, is different. You cannot do in a democratic Taiwan, what you
                    could do in an authoritarian Taiwan. And what to do about that has really
                    perplexed everyone and that exists today among the highest thinkers of these set
                    of relationships, Mr. Kissinger included. That they can easily say, “Well
                    Taiwan, just don't make any noise now because we've got to deal with this big
                    fellow who is very important for us, and you know that's it in your interest,
                    that we have a good relationship. So you just stay down, boy, and don't make any
                    trouble.” That's not even feasible anymore. If you're a political leader and
                    depend on votes, and the people have opinions over there—they're one of the most
                    widely traveled people in the world, 20% of the people in Taiwan travel abroad
                    every year. I mean they're really very conscious of what goes on in the world,
                    so that makes them extremely sensitive to the fact they have no status. They
                    have difficulty going to different countries. They have to get visas on
                    different pieces of paper. They're getting more and more proud, or nationalist,
                    or whatever you want to call it. And that isn't given enough weight here, and it
                    absolutely is not given enough weight over in the PRC, who I think really don't
                    understand the fact. They don't understand democracy, so they don't understand
                    what's going on over there. But the fact is that there is a very, very strong
                    undercurrent in Taiwan of this kind of feeling. And a political leader has got
                    to be responsive to it, or he's going to lose power. And the president of Taiwan
                    no longer has that carte blanche power, no matter how popular he is, that the
                    old leaders of Taiwan used to have. So that is a different set of circumstances.
                    When you have say, “Please don't make noise now because we've got this boy to
                    deal with.” The leader there can't say, “Well, okay, we'll sit tight.” They
                    won't sit around very long because the people aren't going to accept that. So
                    how you deal with it is a very perplexing issue, and that is the problem that
                    we're facing today. It's a democratic Taiwan, and how in the world is that going
                    to fit into this mold that we had before? We are having problems with it
                    already. That's the reason we're in trouble now. Because in trying to deal with
                    this, if one side cannot accept the changes, or doesn't understand the changes
                    like the PRC, not able to understand the things, well, how do you deal with it?
                    So we're in what you said, a bad spot, a rough spot, with the PRC on this
                    because they are not in a position to accept the changes that have to be dealt
                    with now, or they're going to lose out. It's almost a catch 22 because, for
                    example, you mentioned the missile firing. Missile firing was a rather crude way
                    of reminding the Taiwanese to behave, because if they don't behave those missile
                    could be aimed a little bit further on. But what's the other side of that coin?
                    The other side of that coin is that they've just gone through another
                    experience, one that it was “them,” against “us.” It's a unifying experience for
                    the people on Taiwan, and strengthened the differences between the people on
                    Taiwan, and the people on the Mainland. It doesn't help. It hurts that kind of
                    tendency, saying “Fellows, you've got to get together and make up your mind what
                    kind of relationship you want.” And when you do things like, it actually drives
                    them further apart. And that's what's been going on. There are a lot of people,
                    I think, with forlorn hopes. Frankly, I think they're unrealistic. A million
                    plus people from Taiwan travel over on the Mainland. They're tourists, they've
                    got plenty of money, traveling is cheap for them. As far as I know, I don't know
                    what figures, how reliable they can be, but the last time I heard the figures
                    they say a total of 300 out of 7 million have stayed over there. These are
                    people that were old, and wanted to die in their old village back in the
                    Mainland. Nobody will stay over there, and it's become a place where—I'm from
                    up-state New York, when I was growing up a trip to New York City was kind of a
                    rare occurrence, 250 miles away in those days was a long way, and everyone
                    always said, New York is a great place to visit, but I'd never want to live
                    there. Well, that's what the attitude is in Taiwan. The PRC, that's great, it's
                    interesting, its got a big wall, big statues, big buildings, but I wouldn't want
                    to live there.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As we're speaking today, and God knows, one really can't
                        predict, it's still a very authoritarian government which is kind of falling
                        apart in many places.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Well, the standard of living also, I don't know what the per capita
                    income over in China is, maybe 400-450, it's 12,000 on the island. Just that
                    alone in practical terms...I think both sides understand that whatever—they say
                    unification, if that's what it is, that's fine, but it is a long, long way down
                    the road. And there's got to be something to take its place in the meantime, and
                    it can't be what was before, because too many changes have taken place. So no
                    one wants to bite that bullet. It's a very difficult thing. It's probably not
                    the time. China is in the process of deciding on its next leader. How long
                    that's going to take, but I think that article the other day in one of the
                    papers, Wall Street Journal, saying we're really going to have to wait until
                    things settle down over there, and probably settle down here because we have a
                    campaign coming up before anything of any substance can be done. But whether or
                    not we will be willing to bite the bullet, will have the political will, or
                    them, the PRC, to bite the bullet, and say, “Let's sit down and think about the
                    changes and what alterations we should make for this kind of arrangement.” We're
                    always going to have problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There doesn't seem to be much push for unification. On the
                        part of Taiwan, I don't see what's in it for them. In fact many of the
                        people don't...I mean it's a new generation, an island people, just in the
                        normal course of events.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Unification on Taiwan, as it is still in the Mainland is an emotional
                    issue, a carryover from the civil war on the Mainland of China. In Taiwan now,
                    with the Taiwanized government, democracy, all the things that have happened on
                    Taiwan, unification is no longer an emotional issue, it's a practical problem.
                    In China it's still among the top leadership an emotional issue. The old civil
                    war baggage is still on their shoulders. In Taiwan it is no longer an emotional
                    issue, it's a practical problem. That doesn't mean that they'd give up
                    unification. It means, though, if we've got to have it, let's do it in a
                    realistic way. The political leadership on Taiwan has got to put the welfare and
                    security of the people on that island first, or they won't stay in power. And
                    that's the change. Not unification first, the people on Taiwan first.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say you go around and address a lot of Chinese
                        American associations. What are you saying, and what are you getting from
                        them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Oh, they're in quite a change themselves. They're reflecting the
                    turmoil in thinking out there. The older Chinese American groups...I can no
                    longer go to say San Francisco or Los Angeles and just speak with one group.
                    I've got to speak to two or three, or I've got a problem because they won't mix.
                    And the older generation, they really have no emotional attachment to Taiwan per
                    se, their attachment is to a China that doesn't exist anymore. So they're
                    completely befuddled. They don't like what's going on in Taiwan. Taiwan was only
                    supposed to be a temporary footstop before we get back to China. So they're
                    unhappy. And, of course, the PRC is making hay in some of those associations
                    because they're representing themselves as the real China now, “We're not what
                    we used to be.” So they're making some inroads. Taiwan is losing the allegiance
                    of a lot of the old Chinatown crowd, places like that.</p>
                <p>The new immigrants from Taiwan are the real basis of support for Taiwan these
                    days. And they have plenty of support within the country. The younger generation
                    that is coming here now, immigrating to the United States, gets much more
                    involved in our politics than the older generation. They ran their laundry, and
                    their restaurants, and they sent their kids to medical school, and they didn't
                    care about all this other business. Not now. This younger generation here,
                    they're really savvy and they're very much involved in the politics of their
                    communities. And if these organizations were ever able to unify, which is
                    totally against their character, they probably could be a political force. But
                    they have difficulty unifying, so they're are not. But if you're talking about
                    what problems do we have, if you want to have a sense of what I think, we don't
                    here as a country have a sense of the revolution that's taking place in Taiwan.
                    I've just lived through it these five years. When I began to talk to these
                    groups, especially the Taiwanese groups, the overwhelming problem was, why can't
                    we get a visa to go back home? They were blacklisted. There were people that
                    couldn't go because they preached independence and all of this business. That
                    was the overwhelming problem of the groups here in the United States. That's all
                    gone now. It's all gone. They can go back. Some of them are in the legislature.
                    If you go to meet the leader of the opposition, he has spent 25 years in jail.
                    Nobody has been killed by this revolution that's taking place, so people haven't
                    noticed it as much. But if you could feel it when you go to Taiwan the people
                    that you're dealing with now, it's like a big breath of fresh air. They want to
                    talk independence. They want to oppose the leadership simply because they can do
                    it now, and weren't able to do it before. It's that kind of thing that the
                    leadership has to live with. They have opened the doors, and opened the windows,
                    and everybody wants to shout, and boy their politics are as vigorous as you can
                    find anywhere. Because it's new, it's invigorating. They can really do all the
                    things that they could never do before. And that strengthens them very much. So
                    we worry about that they should really be thinking about their relationship with
                    the Mainland. The only time they think about it is how much money can I make
                    over there, or if they shoot missiles, there they are, at it again. But
                    otherwise they don't think of the Mainland. They think of all their problems on
                    Taiwan.</p>

                <p>BELLOCCHI: No, although some of them are in the groups. The groups I talk to are
                    usually quite identified with the Taiwan side, and you don't find them there.
                    Where you find the differences in the groups that I talk with, are really in
                    generation because even Mainlander young people who are recent immigrants from
                    Taiwan, are not terribly different than Taiwanese immigrants from Taiwan in
                    thinking. What they have is what today's Taiwan is like, whereas the older
                    generation are thinking of the day's that are now history.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here you are in this quasi-official position. Can you talk
                        to them the way you're talking to me now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: I remember the first group I went to talk to was the Taiwanese
                    American Chamber of Commerce of North America, having their annual meeting up in
                    New York, and I decided to go and I gave them the talk. I had been giving talks
                    before that were much more candid than before. I think previous AIT people had
                    always talked about trade, and how well the relationship was doing, and put them
                    all asleep type of talk. And I decided Taiwan was opening up, and we had to tell
                    people what Taiwan was like. It was more than just trade in this relationship.
                    So they were a little bit shocked in the older groups that I would talk about
                    the changes taking place, and how bad it was. They weren't letting their own
                    citizens back into Taiwan, and the fact that they were developing quite a
                    different identity on Taiwan than those people on the Mainland. This was almost
                    heresy to be saying this. Well, when I went up to the group in New York, this
                    was the first Taiwanese group...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was about when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Towards the end of 1990, around that time. There was still all the
                    business of visas and all, so I gave them that kind of talk and told them what
                    Taiwan was like. And you can't imagine the feeling of the people. There was
                    about 400-500 people. They always have huge crowds in these things. There were
                    about 400-500 people there and you could tell that they were so, so happy that
                    someone from what they perceived government, was actually paying attention to
                    them. They had never had anyone pay any attention to them before. So as I travel
                    around the country talking to more of these groups, I sense they really had a
                    very strong feeling that they were sort of cut adrift. I think now that that's
                    changing. They're really getting a lot more confident. I mean Taiwan's pragmatic
                    diplomacy is giving us a lot of problems in terms of our policy. But it is very,
                    very well received by the Taiwanese community, even here in America. Certainly
                    back home that's given them a little pride.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I keep referring because right now I'm doing a couple of
                        interviews with other Chinese more Mainland oriented. One as we mentioned
                        before is Chas Freeman, who was both deputy chief of mission in Beijing, and
                        also ambassador to Saudi Arabia. So I asked him about the difference between
                        the Taiwanese lobby and the Israeli lobby. The Israeli lobby is renowned in
                        the United States. And his thing was really in many ways the Taiwanese
                        lobby, particularly in this day, was getting more effective because the
                        Israelis were more in your face in that they would come, and say you do
                        this, and if you don't do this I'll have a Senator calling you by this
                        afternoon. Whereas he said the Taiwanese have cultivated and really gotten
                        much more into that. I don't know. I just want you to comment on that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Okay, I know Chas has just made a speech out there in Hong Kong that
                    said they bought the vote, I think that's absurd, really, I'm sorry, it's
                    absurd.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about the vote about...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: ...whether or not we should give them visas to come here to visit. The
                    resolution got a 96 to 0 vote. Lobbying certainly helped. There's a lot of
                    lobbying that goes on. That doesn't hurt, but it's the message, and I think it
                    really misdirects our ideas if we think that they bought it. But, there's no
                    question about their effectiveness, and they're coming close to what you have
                    just described. They have plenty of people up on the Hill, influencing a very
                    broad spectrum of politicians. It used to be that only very conservative
                    Republicans...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about Senator Knowland and a few from
                        California.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: But that's changed now, democracy has made quite a difference up on
                    the Hill. I mean, someone like Leiberman in Connecticut, and Paul Simon in
                    Chicago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about quite liberal Senators.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: ...these are people that support them because they are a democracy,
                    and they have turned their human rights thing around so completely, so they have
                    a very broad spectrum of support up on the Hill. And yes, the Taiwan lobby is
                    getting more and more open because it's a democracy and they can't hide the
                    figures anymore. And even PR firms like Cassidy are being used to generate
                    public relations. Well, that's a lot like what the Israelis were doing. It's the
                    same kind of thing. And the fact that the Taiwanese themselves are far more
                    politically active in our politics, all of this has meant that they have greater
                    radar reach on the Hill, and they more clearly understand that the only thing
                    that really keeps them in play is the Congress. They're well aware of that.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Nat, to sort of end this, from your perspective
                        we're talking about August 1995. How do you see the relationship with
                        Taiwan, the People's Republic, and the United States developing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Taiwan would like us to detach that trilateral relationship and make
                    that two separate bilaterals. I don't think it's possible, of course, because
                    you've always got to take the other into consideration. But it's troublesome. I
                    think the relationship with the PRC is a separate issue, and it may even get
                    worse because of our politics. But that hasn't anything to do with Taiwan.
                    Unless we can start accepting that we've got to do something different than we
                    were doing before, I mean really different, we'll have trouble. We won't have
                    the same kind of relationship we've had with Taiwan in the past. They've got
                    money. They've got great economic strength, and they've got political strength
                    because in March 1996, I'm sure Lee will be elected, directly elected, by the 21
                    million people on that island to be their president. You can't get more
                    legitimate than that. And what do we do about it? When they say, “I'm the
                    president of Taiwan, I want to do this, and I want to do that, or I want to go
                    this way.” We can say no, of course, but at some cost.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Taiwan's relationship with other countries? We
                        tend to be U.S. centric. when we put this thing together, but how do they
                        deal with other countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: With difficulty because all these other countries as on almost every
                    issue, are hiding under our skirts. They always tell the Taiwanese, “You deal
                    with the Americans, and you want to enter GATT, you deal with the Americans.”
                    Only when the Americans stick their neck out, are they willing to stick their
                    neck out afterward. But in many cases it's getting more and more difficult. When
                    we gave Taiwan trouble on military sales, the French moved in and sold them
                    Mirages, for example, and then moved right back out again. They don't have the
                    same interest we have, none of the Europeans do, so they can dance in and out of
                    these problems and leave it up to us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I imagine Japan...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Oh, no, they're more cautious than ever. I mean they've got more at
                    stake, they're much closer to China than we are. They've got problems, and
                    they're growing problems. Some of the problems that they're growing in Japan are
                    the same things that we've had to face. They've got a lot of business with
                    Taiwan; they have more business with the PRC than we do. We have more business
                    with Taiwan than the PRC. They have it the other way around, but they also have
                    a democracy that's increasingly aware of the democracy in Taiwan. So Taiwan's
                    support in Japan is actually growing. It was very high at first because they
                    appreciated that old Chiang Kai-shek didn't demand reparations for World War II.
                    Well, that crowd has sort of died away. They've sort of become history just like
                    Chiang Kai-shek has become history. But now the newer group is coming up.
                    They're doing business with Taiwan. They respect democracy in Taiwan. So I think
                    the Foreign Office, in Tokyo is beginning to feel the same kind of pressures
                    that our State Department feels on the issue of Taiwan. In a much lesser degree
                    now because their inclination to be more wary of the PRC is much greater than
                    ours, based more on geography than anything else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about some of these other relationships, sort of an
                        ASEAN, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines, again they're in that
                        area very suspicious of the power of Mainland China.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: But there's something else too. Taiwan has become the largest investor
                    in Vietnam, and the second largest in most of the other countries, Thailand,
                    Indonesia, Philippines. The Philippines are becoming a major factor in this. So
                    here's little Taiwan which offers no threat to them at all putting money in
                    their country. Whereas their own Chinese population, many of them are putting
                    money in Mainland China, taking them out of the country. Here's Taiwan, putting
                    some money in. So that helps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you see upon the Taiwan government...is this natural
                        economic expansion, or is this, I mean as you see it, are they making real
                        efforts to make sure they invest in various places?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: No, they can't direct it. It's very much a free market. As a matter of
                    fact if they could direct it they wouldn't have this much going into the
                    Mainland that goes now. It really is very difficult for them to direct. I mean
                    they can try incentives, which is what they're doing with the southern strategy,
                    for example, and being led by some state enterprises, to go down there and
                    invest. But that's all. They can't coerce their private sectors into these
                    areas. Erland Heginbotham, formerly a DAS at State, attended the seminar that I
                    was in, and he said that if you want to know where the next economic
                    opportunities are in the Asia area, follow the Taiwanese businessmen, because
                    they're largely small corporations, or little branches of bigger ones that take
                    risks, and they move. I mean, if the opportunity, especially labor costs are
                    cheaper here than there, then they take their machines out of there, and simply
                    move them over to the other ones. A very simple operation.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds like a much more flexible operation than say the
                        Japanese.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Oh, yes. It's part of the character in Taiwan. They can never get
                    together, so they're all little individual companies, but it really gives them
                    enormous flexibility. So you find some of the investment that has been in China
                    gets disgusted, they simply pick up their machines, put them on a boat, and go
                    down to Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would imagine the Taiwan-Vietnam relationship...Vietnam
                        as we talk now we've just started to open American relations, but I would
                        think the Vietnamese would welcome Taiwan because there's obviously no love
                        lost between Vietnam and China these days.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BELLOCCHI: Also no danger. So no, of course, they have an investment guarantee
                    agreement with Taiwan. Even the KMT has made investments in Vietnam, a big
                    industrial park down there. And a lot of companies have gone down there. They're
                    welcomed by the Vietnamese. One Taiwanese businessman I talked to in Taichung
                    who had factories in both Fujian and Vietnam, and asked him what he thought of
                    the two. And he compared in very much an absolutely apolitical way, he wasn't
                    thinking of politics at all. But saying labor costs were cheaper in Vietnam,
                    trainability was better in Fuchien, but quality was better in their labor in
                    Vietnam. And then he wrapped up the discussion by saying that one big difference
                    was that Vietnamese officials encourage him to invest, while Chinese officials
                    expect him to do so.</p>
