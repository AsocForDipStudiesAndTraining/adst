                <p>Interviewed by: James F. Shea and Don R. Kienzle </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: November 15, 1993</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>Shea: My name is Jim Shea. Today is November 15, 1993. Don Kienzle and I are at
                    the new National Foreign Affairs Training Center in Arlington, Virginia,
                    conducting an interview for the Labor Diplomacy Oral History Program. Today we
                    are interviewing my old friend and colleague Bruce Millen, who among other
                    things served as Labor Attach� in Rome, Oslo, New Delhi, and Ankara. Bruce, do
                    you want to tell us something about your background, how you got interested in
                    labor, and how you came into the Foreign Service?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: I first became interested in trade unionism when I was in university. I
                    came from a rather conservative, Republican background both in terms of family
                    and in terms of community, so this was a kind of a departure that all at once I
                    should get interested in labor issues.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Where did you grow up?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: I was brought up for the first ten years of my life in Appleton,
                    Wisconsin. My family then moved to Oak Park, Illinois, after my father lost his
                    business in the depression. Later I went to Northwestern [University] for my
                    undergraduate studies. At one of these colloquiums where a guest speaker came
                    in, I exhibited an interest in following the trade union movement. He said, “If
                    you don't come out of a plant, forget it!” Incidentally I had a similar
                    experience when I exhibited an interest in going into the Foreign Service. That
                    particular speaker said, “If you don't have private money, forget it.” Those
                    were the first two jobs I had after I came out of the military. That's the
                    background. I came into [the Foreign Service] partly because I was in political
                    trouble in the unions. I thought I was going to get fired because of internecine
                    warfare between George Boldanzi and Emil Rieve over the Presidency of the
                    Textile Workers Union; I tried to stay neutral, but it did not work.</p>
                <p>Shea: Was this the Textile Workers Union?</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>MILLEN: No, the CIO Southern Organizational Committee which often tied into TWU
                    projects. It was interesting how I got my job with the CIO. I read in Newsweek
                    that the CIO was establishing a Southern Organizing Committee. I was living in
                    New Orleans at the time and about to be discharged from the military. So I sent
                    a night letter to a man named Van Bittner, who was mentioned in the article. He
                    was from the Steel Workers Union and had a long record with the Miners Union
                    with CIO President Murray. At any rate, he wrote back immediately, “Go see Fred
                    Pieper, the CIO Director at 544 Camp Street, New Orleans.” I walked in and Fred
                    hired me. I was still in [military] uniform.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Was this in 1945?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Early 1946. I was still in uniform. He didn't ask for any references or
                    anything. He just hired me. He said, “When you get out of uniform, come in.” He
                    put me on the Political Action Committee payroll.</p>
                <p>Shea: I didn't catch the name. Who was this fellow?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Fred Pieper. He was out of the Automobile Workers Union. He came out of
                    the Homer Martin group, so he was not in great repute himself with the existing
                    leadership. They had put him down there [in New Orleans] partly to exile him.
                    From my point of view, he was a remarkable person.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Could you explain for future students who the Homer Martin people
                    were?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Homer Martin was the first President of the United Automobile Workers
                    before it even became the CIO. He came out of a preacher's background, and he
                    was a great speech maker [but] not much of a union leader. He eventually ended
                    up as a captive of the industry, so there was a great struggle within the UAW
                    when they finally got rid of him. That battle and its repercussions went on for
                    years. It turned out that Fred organized a lot of people during the war years,
                    and he was really one of the most capable people I ever met in the trade union
                    movement.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Was he part of the Textile Workers Union?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: No, he was Regional Director for the CIO.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: What were your duties then for the CIO?</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>MILLEN: Well, at that time they turned me into a Political Action Representative,
                    so I raised money and tried to keep track of political action and so forth. I
                    was in one Congressional campaign. We were maneuvered by the state textile group
                    into backing a candidate. The group got on this fellow's bandwagon very early on
                    and shoved him through, and all at once we had a candidate, who we really didn't
                    know very well. It was laughable and yet I got a lot of experience out of it.
                    Our man lost as we thought he would, but we thought that we might force a run
                    off with F. Edward Hebert, who was beginning to accumulate seniority, and jiggle
                    the results a little bit more to our satisfaction. As it turned out, our
                    candidate got roughly 5,000 votes, but that wasn't enough to affect the
                    primary.</p>
                <p>Then the CIO wanted to transfer me to the Chicago Political Action Committee, but
                    they said, “After the elections in November [1946], we are not sure you will
                    have a job.” So I went to Fred and told him about this. He said, “Well, hell, I
                    didn't put you on their payroll to have you go to Chicago. I put you on their
                    payroll for you to get a little experience. I'll put you on our payroll now.” So
                    I stayed in Louisiana, then later was transferred to South Carolina, then to
                    Alabama briefly, and finally to Virginia. Soon after I applied to the Foreign
                    Service-I was recruited through Jim Taylor and Bureau of International Affairs
                    over in the Department of Labor-my recall to the Army popped up on the horizon.
                    I had an anxious two months until it was all sorted out, and I was sworn in as a
                    Foreign Service Reserve Officer in June 1951. Kienzle: Well, let's back up just
                    a minute. You were busy in organizing activities in the Southern states?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Yes, after Fred put me on the organizing staff, then I worked as an
                    organizer, although I was doing lobbying along with Fred in 1948 in the
                    Louisiana state legislature.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: So your application for the Foreign Service was submitted in about
                    1949?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: It was submitted sometime in the late 1950.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: How long were you an organizer?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: For about five years. The same day that my security clearance for the
                    State Department came through, I got my orders to report back to the Army.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: This would have been in what year?</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>MILLEN: This would have been in early 1951. It was during the Korean War. I had a
                    nervous several weeks [not knowing] whether I was going into the Foreign Service
                    or back into the military. There was a lot of to-ing and fro-ing at that time. I
                    was in Radford, Virginia, working on a Hercules Powder Plant campaign, so I was
                    coming back and forth to Washington pretty often and some of the people in the
                    CIO staff, [in particular] Walter Harris, formerly of the Mine Workers, were
                    trying with the military to get me out; even Anna Rosenberg said that she would
                    help if necessary. She didn't like to interfere with individual Army units, but
                    if it was absolutely necessary she said she would take up [my case]. As it
                    turned out Jim Taylor from the Labor Department out-foxed the bureaucracy.
                    Taylor had State write me a letter saying that when I reported for duty at the
                    Department of State, I would be offered the job of Assistant Labor Attach� in
                    Rome and then he had the Secretary of Labor, I think, write a letter to the
                    Third Army saying, “He's going to fight Togliatti single-handedly.” The Army
                    released me.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Would you identify Anna Rosenberg for us?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: She was Assistant Secretary for Manpower for the Army. She was a very
                    bright, liberal social activist and powerful person in both Democratic circles
                    and in military circles. Jim Taylor was at the Labor Department in the Bureau of
                    International Labor Affairs.</p>
                <p>Shea: Let's go back just a little bit. Did Mike Ross and the people in the [CIO]
                    International Department put your name forward?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: No. I more or less just walked in off the street. A friend of mine, who
                    was a reporter for the Christian Science Monitor, told me about the availability
                    of these jobs. So I just walked into Jim Taylor's office, and they were
                    immediately interested. Of course I had to have Mike Ross' approval and Phil
                    Delaney's approval from the AFL side. So that was it.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Did you have any trouble getting AFL support given your CIO
                    background?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: In those days Mike and Phil had a working relationship [and I could
                    expect approval] unless I came in with warts all over my head or something.
                    Early on in my briefing over at the Department of State, I began to realize the
                    factions that were developing over labor policy in Italy. They were all trying
                    to enlist my support, and I being a neophyte was trying to fight them off. I
                    knew nothing about Italy, foreign labor or anything else. So I certainly wasn't
                    going to join a cabal at that stage of the game. On the other hand I learned
                    that there were existing cabals.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Could you describe the briefing process that went on in 1951?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: I really can't in any detail. I saw this and that fellow: Dan Horowitz,
                    Irwin Tobin, the fellow from Latin America who finally got in trouble with the
                    McCarthy. Shea: John Fishburn?</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>MILLEN: Yes, [John] Fishburn. All those people. Some of them took me a little
                    higher in their organizations, but to me it was a brand new experience and I was
                    reeling from [both] the confusion that existed within me and the excitement of
                    this type of assignment.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: How long was the briefing process?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Well, it went on for a long time, because, as I remember, I got to
                    Washington and I was sworn in on June 29th and through some failure of the
                    appropriations bill, all travel was suspended. So here I was sitting over in a
                    room on 16th Street all ready to go and I had to wait an extra four or five
                    weeks before I could get in motion. I arrived in Rome on August 15th or
                    something on that order, right in the middle of ferro agosto, where you wondered
                    where all the people had gone. I must say, however, the delay did give me a
                    period in which to assay the factional battles being fought with State.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Do you want to go into the factions that were there?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Well, it really boiled down to the pro-UIL (Unione Italiana del Lavoro or
                    Italian Union of Labor Unions) and the pro-CISL (Confederazione Italiana
                    Syndacati Lavoratori or Italian Confederation of Workers' Unions) [factions],
                    the former being a mildly Social Democratic-Republican mixture and CISL being a
                    Christian Democratic [group]. Of course at that early stage I didn't realize how
                    thin the veil was over CISL with regard to its professed apolitical,
                    aconfessional image. It was anything but.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: How would your characterize it?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: In reality CISL was almost totally dominated by the Christian Democratic
                    Party. The only ones who didn't know that were the Americans, I guess. I
                    remember going into a barber shop in La Spezia. I had gone upstairs to the CISL
                    office and [nobody was there]. It was around lunch time, so I went downstairs
                    and got a haircut in the barber shop. I told them I was looking for the CISL.
                    “Oh, Sindicato de preti.” was his response. (The syndicate of priests.) The
                    Italians knew this game and it was only the Americans, particularly the American
                    trade union leaders, who came over and were so firm in their beliefs that this
                    was an apolitical, aconfessional union.</p>
                <p>Shea: Did you get any language training in the United States?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: No, in those days we didn't get paid [for language training]. Those bills
                    were not paid. I started the first week I was in Rome at Berlitz, and studied
                    for the first six to eight months. Then along about that time [the Department of
                    State] brought in language subsidies.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: You had no Italian before you went over to Italy?</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>MILLEN: No. In fact one of my fears was, as we came down and landed on a Saturday
                    night, I said to myself, “What am I doing here? I know not one word of the
                    language.” Italy was a strange new world, both bureaucratically on my side of
                    the fence and in terms of the Italian culture and systems and so forth. I was
                    petrified, absolutely petrified. [On my arrival] I was greeted by a fellow who
                    had been called in from his vacation to come and meet me at the airport. He was
                    in not too cheery a disposition, but he did get us into town, and the next day
                    being a Sunday, some guy from the Administrative Office called up and said, “Is
                    this Bruce Millen?” And I said, “Yes.” He said, “Thank you,” and hung up.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Who was your boss there, the Labor Attach�?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Colonel Lane. We all called him “the colonel” because of his military
                    background. He had earlier had experience with the Fifth Army, much of which was
                    over in Trieste. Then right after the war he moved into the Embassy in Rome. I
                    guess he had been a colonel in “intelligence,” and this operation going that was
                    interesting. I had been there two days, I think, and was writing about some
                    little thing out of the paper to send back as a form of a dispatch-It would have
                    been my first dispatch. Those are high moments, you know.- and I was told by
                    Tom's principal assistant, “You can report anything as long as it is favorable
                    to CISL.”</p>
                <p>Kienzle: There was a slight bias?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: That was my welcome.</p>
                <p>Shea: Can you recall who the assistant was?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: It was Jim Toughill. He came out of the I.U.E. He was a charming
                    rascal.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Was he an American?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Yes. So that was my first instruction. Then I had been there not more
                    than a week when I was called over by either the Political Counselor or Tommy
                    Thompson, who would have been Deputy Chief of Mission. I don't know [which for
                    sure]. Anyway, talk came up about my background and I told them what I had been
                    doing, and he said, “Oh! We were told that you were out of public relations in
                    the union movement.” Here again, the atmosphere already had this sense of
                    mystery and conspiracy, and I had only been there a week. But life settled down,
                    and I enjoyed myself.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: How would you characterize our policy toward the trade union
                    movements?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: In a way [our policy was] juvenile.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>Kienzle: In terms of promoting CISL at the expense of other non-Communist but
                    legitimate unions?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: In a way. It wasn't that everything we did was wrong. We were pumping a
                    lot of covert money in and certainly at one stage of the game back, in 1948,
                    that was important. As I have noticed these things over the years in different
                    countries, we just don't know how stop anything. That which has a very
                    legitimate starting point usually just continues on and on and on and builds and
                    more and more people get a vested interest in it and there is no way to stop it.
                    To gain perspective, one must realize our support for CISL was only indirectly a
                    trade union issue. The U.S. commitment to CISL by the U.S. Government and the
                    American trade union alike was, more accurately, support for the Christian
                    Democratic Party as the chosen agent against Communism in general and the USSR
                    in particular. The Communist CGIL, being so powerful and with its ties to
                    Socialism ( no matter how confused at times) or variants thereof, became a major
                    field of battle.</p>
                <p>Many labor attach�s and others doing related work in the international labor
                    field thought that building solid, independent trade unions in and by itself
                    contributed to building democratic institutions. In Italy, we reverted to the
                    pre-World War II pattern of building a religious political movement and a union
                    movement controlled by, or guided by, the Church. This was a chancy gamble given
                    the extent of anti-monarchical and anti-clerical opinion in Italy. The policy
                    worked in 1948 fortunately because of the fear of Communism in the general
                    public-even among those who normally would never vote Christian Democratic. But,
                    in the long haul, it was a self-defeating policy.</p>
                <p>On the labor side with the break away of the CISL group (helped in great measure
                    by U.S. assistance) its leaders and the U.S. sources, public and private,
                    declared the new labor confederation to be apolitical and a confessional. Few
                    Italians believed that claim. The moderate Saragat Socialists under Saragat set
                    up their own union, the UIL; the International Confederation of Free Trade
                    Unions accepted the UIL membership. The U. S. persisted in its sole support for
                    CISL as the representative of the Italian workers. In effect, we denied trade
                    union and political legitimacy to a substantial part of the Italian electorate.
                    Instead of working to build a multi-faceted, genuine anti-Communist trade union
                    force which could contribute to complementing other democratic institutions, we
                    returned to an old agenda.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: How were we assisting CISL?</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>MILLEN: Oh, we were paying an awful lot of money out. I don't know [exactly how
                    much but] the Italians used to tell me to the tenth of a lira how much we were
                    paying out. Tom Lane's English counterpart, the British Labor Counselor, would
                    have lunch with me and say, “And what about this 620 million lire?”-or whatever
                    the amount was in those days. He had specific figures and I knew nothing about
                    amounts or anything like that. There were lots of indications that money was
                    being passed. There were certain safes that I couldn't use and things of that
                    nature. There was plenty of evidence that CISL was pretty much in our keep. The
                    amusing thing was that all we did was pick up the tab for what the Christian
                    Democratic Party would have had to pick up if we hadn't been there. The
                    rationale-and I think it could be justified at one time-was that if we paid CISL
                    that made the unions more independent of the party. But I never saw any evidence
                    that CISL had that much control over anything very important. Of course, Lane
                    had influence in the selection of ministers of labor and that sort of stuff, but
                    it created such an unreal situation that over the long run it probably made it
                    much more difficult for CISL to become an independent force from either the
                    party or us.</p>
                <p>But as I said, I had fun. Lane dreamed up this idea that we would use [our]
                    bargaining power when we issued large contracts or loans. We would use political
                    criteria and I spent a lot of my time out on the road checking the political
                    situation in various plants there. How much [union representation came from]
                    CGIL (Confederazione Generale Italiana del Lavoro or the Italian General
                    Federation of Labor) or CISL or UIL or MSI (Movimento Socialista Italiana, the
                    neo-fascist labor movement).</p>
                <p>Kienzle: These were assistance loans to private firms?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Yes, or they were contacts.</p>
                <p>Shea: Was this the forerunner of the off-shore procurement policy?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Yes, this was part and parcel of off-shore procurement, combined with MSA
                    loans, etc. In fact I remember one day-I was not invited until very late-some
                    admiral from the United States came over with his flock to discuss the
                    procurement of 75 to 90 million dollars worth of ships, and I talked about using
                    these contracts as a political instrument. There must have been 50 to 75 people
                    there. Looking back it was funny because the admiral just looked at me and said,
                    “Very interesting, young man. We're here to buy ships.” He could not have cared
                    less about the political complexion.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Were there cases where contracts were denied to organizations that had
                    unions other than CISL?</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>MILLEN: Well, it gave us a basis for bargaining. I think for a while we had some
                    impact. We didn't say to fire anybody, or at least I didn't. Some others did.
                    But you could say, “Well, it is our understanding that the Communists”-We called
                    them “shop stewards” which was not exactly a precise term but a short hand
                    method for their representatives on the Commissioni Interni, the Internal
                    Commission.-”are reportedly running free, while the CISL members are tied to
                    their machines.” So we could make pitches to give them at least equality of
                    treatment: “Either tighten up on one force or let the other force loose” and
                    things of that nature. I think for a while we had some short run influence, but
                    I began to suspect later on that what CISL and all the unions were really saying
                    was, “Well, look, if it is the difference between getting a contract or not
                    getting a contract, we'll give you ten of our Commissiones Interni members,” and
                    all could agree to that kind of a division. Jobs were jobs. Possibly we induced
                    management to be more circumspect.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Were we in effect influencing management to give preferential treatment
                    to CISL?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Yes, this is what we hoped to do. But it all broke down and was very
                    discouraging. I ran into one straight three million dollar loan from the Mutual
                    Security Administration, which we now call AID, for a plant up in the Alto
                    Adige, right outside of Bolzano. That was one of the plants that Mussolini had
                    put there to get some Italian presence up in the Austrian part of Italy, and it
                    was staffed 99 percent with Italians. Mussolini moved Italians up there to take
                    those jobs. Well, the problem there, at least from my point of view, was that
                    the management was supporting neo-fascists, so I blocked the loan and got in
                    serious difficulty with our Deputy Chief of the Economic Aid Mission. I also got
                    a lecture from either the Deputy Chief of Mission or the head of the Political
                    Section. I pointed out, “If we are not here to support democratic rights, what
                    good is all our anti-Communism going to do us? You are going to lose.” Well, he
                    was much disgruntled by my [comments].</p>
                <p>Kienzle: There was no effort at all to eliminate fascists from positions of
                    power?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: The management there was actually giving active support to the fascist
                    unions. So I held up that [loan] but at some personal cost. I was informed the
                    loan was approved after my transfer.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: This would have been around 1952?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: This would have been 1953 or something on that order. My attitude didn't
                    leave a satisfactory taste in the mouths of our people who called me in.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>The one person I know about who was fired because of our efforts provided a great
                    deal of (from my point of view) national adverse publicity to our Mission and
                    provided to the cynic in me a piece of high comedy. A plant superintendent in
                    Florence, an avowed Communist famous for his behavior during World War II,
                    credited with bringing his optical plant back into production quickly after the
                    war, was identified as one who “must go.” All this in a city with a saintly
                    Christian Socialist mayor who supported the plant manager.</p>
                <p>A high level delegation from the U.S. Mission trouped over to Florence to insure
                    action. It worked. Dozens of papers in Florence and Rome headlined the
                    “discharge.” The plant manager was released, transferred to headquarters in
                    Belgium with a big title, made a member of the Board of Directors and provided
                    with a much larger income. Peace was restored and the Embassy was satisfied.
                    Fortunately, I was too junior to accompany our warriors, and for that matter,
                    never knew what propelled us to take this action. For a change, I kept my
                    comments to myself. It was a purely Italian solution and apparently satisfactory
                    to all concerned. One final story under this category took place one night in
                    Minister Tasca's office. A director of one of Italy's myriad of state owned
                    enterprises sought support for a loan or contract. After listening to the U.S.
                    plea for more sympathetic treatment of the CISL, the director stated bluntly
                    that it was not a difficult problem. He would direct the discharge of 3,000
                    Communist workers. I coughed and yammered and finally succeeded in getting our
                    Minister out of the room. I pointed out to him that the United States Government
                    could not absorb this type of publicity as the story was bound to become
                    public-in fact the plant director would be the first to claim he was “following
                    U.S. orders.” We came back into the room and explained we were not demanding
                    discharges, simply equal treatment of CGIL leaders and CISL activists on the
                    work floor. The three of us parted soon thereafter, convinced we had done
                    something important, nebulous as that might be.</p>
                <p>In general one might say the entire effort of political-economic coercion to be
                    of sound and fury. It might have stiffened a few backs on the side of
                    management, but suffered diminishing returns as the Italians learned how to
                    manipulate the system.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: How did the Labor Attach� Tom Lane react [to your blocking the MSA loan
                    to the plant in Alto Adige]?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Tom seldom said anything to me. He boasted of his never leaving
                    “fingerprints,” i.e. his signature on any matter. And that was certainly true in
                    all of his relationships with me. He stayed out of this one publicly as he did
                    on any issue involving me or any of the issues I raised. On economic issues or
                    decisions I took, I did pretty much what I wanted.</p>
                <p>Shea: Who was the ambassador at that time?</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>MILLEN: When I got there, we had one of the real old-timers. I can't remember his
                    name. He went from there to France. Then we got the sugar king, [Ellsworth]
                    Bunker. He was a delightful guy, savvy and a decent type of person. He was not
                    ideological in the sense others were, a pragmatist one would say. You could talk
                    to him and reason with him. In later years, when I would meet him on the street
                    or when he was Ambassador to India-I visited him there.-I always enjoyed talking
                    to him.</p>
                <p>And then in about 1954 we had Clare Boothe Luce come in. I didn't have much
                    contact with her. I was led to believe that she, by mere chance, saved my neck
                    on an investigation of me. I was the subject of an apparently informal inquiry
                    within the Embassy about me, and the best that I could make out of it was that I
                    was being charged with being an irresponsible radical.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Who raised the charges?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: I don't know. A year later I was later told by the Political Counselor
                    that he had not been there long when a serious person in the Embassy had laid
                    letters in front of him pertaining to me which he signed. He said the he had no
                    reason to doubt that this fellow and others and didn't understand what was going
                    on. He said to me, “I signed the papers and sent them to Washington.” I was
                    later told by the fellow who kept the records on this investigation [at the
                    Embassy] that it went on for two months. I never knew anything about it until it
                    was all over.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: What were the specifics of the charges?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: I have told you as much as he told me. My friend got semi-drunk one night
                    after both of our wives had returned to the United States, and we had been
                    invited over to dinner at somebody's house. Afterwards he came back to my place
                    and we talked and drank and drank and talked. This whole story came out. It is
                    just absolutely fascinating. This guy was a personal friend. He was a garrulous
                    old boy from Tennessee, and I am sure it would have been hard for him to sit on
                    this information, so he just told me. I was absolutely flabbergasted at the
                    whole thing. Finally it was just dropped. I don't think it ever reached any
                    conclusion. As he told the story, Ambassador Luce came through while they were
                    deliberating one day and said, “Is this [discussion] still [about] the Millen
                    problem?” They said, “Yes.” And she said, “Why don't we forget about it,” and
                    that was the end of it!</p>
                <p>Kienzle: So Ambassador Luce closed the case?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Unwittingly she closed the case. I think that she had begun to lose faith
                    in Tom Lane.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: What sort of labor background did Tom Lane have?</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>MILLEN: Tom was member of the Brick Masons' Local Number One in Washington, D.C.
                    I could never figure out whether he ever actually laid brick or not. I suspect
                    that he did in his youth. He became a lawyer, which always dumbfounded me
                    because he was “illiterate” in both English and Italian. What a show he could
                    put on!</p>
                <p>Kienzle: He must have been a good “contact person”?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Well, look, anybody who is delivering that much money is a good contact
                    person. You don't have to look for friends. I heard him once. I had written a
                    despatch of some sort, and he called [into his office] Louisa San Severino, a
                    marvelous research person, [who worked at the Embassy]. She was both a Contessa
                    and a Professoresa. She was an interesting and nice person. She did research for
                    us and translation of articles. I happened to be in the outside office one day
                    and Tom was saying to her, “What do you think of that?” There was a pause. I
                    guess my name was attached to this question, because I stood stock still. She
                    looked at it and said, “Well, you know, I turn material over to Mr. Millen and
                    then he does with it what he wants. I don't assume direct responsibility for
                    that interpretation, but if you want to know whether I agree with that, yes, I
                    do.”</p>
                <p>Shea: Bruce, at that time you got around Rome. Did you meet any of the officials
                    of the CGIL.</p>
                <p>MILLEN: No. There was pretty much a non-contact policy, and they weren't
                    available. I used to go to all their rallies. I would go to some of their inside
                    rallies when DeVittorio was speaking in a theater, and they never objected. But
                    when an architect-sculptor. . . I have forgotten his name now, but the man who
                    did the figure in front of Solidarity House in Detroit. . . He was a architect.
                    He did public housing. He was an advisor to Walter [Reuther] and so forth. [In
                    any case], among other things he did a statue that he cast in a little town just
                    outside of Florence, and I got an invitation for the unveiling. “Oh, God, no!
                    You can't go there!” was the cry. “They have a Communist mayor.” Well, I said,
                    “So what? The mayor probably won't show up anyway.” Well, he didn't show up. I
                    did go. Nobody could really dream up a reason why I shouldn't go.</p>
                <p>Shea: What were your impressions of Giuseppe DeVittorio?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Well, from reading and seeing him at meetings and so forth, he was a very
                    commanding guy and had a true presence on the platform. He looked like a big
                    peasant from my recollection.</p>
                <p>Shea: As I recall he was a peasant, I think, from Puglia.</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Yes, something of that sort.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: This was the head of the CGIL?</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>MILLEN: Yes</p>
                <p>Shea: As I understand it, he was from the Farm Workers Union.</p>
                <p>MILLEN: He may have been. I have forgotten all that. But that CGIL staff had good
                    economists. They really were for the most part first rate. I remember once that
                    the CGIL put out a five year economic plan for Italy, which was a good plan,
                    worthy of serious consideration. I wouldn't want to buy the whole thing. At any
                    rate I went to a reception from the Confindustria, which is the industrial
                    association, and I asked one of their chief economists what he thought of the
                    plan. He said, “Well, it's not bad.” [I asked], “Does the Confindustria ever put
                    out any such documents?” He replied with a grin, “Our job is to create a
                    response to the CGIL plan.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Were your contacts almost exclusively with the CISL?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: And the UIL. I had a lot of contacts with the UIL. That was part of the
                    problem that I had there. I got into trouble with Irving Brown and Jay
                    [Lovestone] and the Colonel [Tom Lane] and the Embassy and the CIA and the AFL,
                    because I was being friendly to the UIL and occasionally I would get them a trip
                    to the United States, or some other favor. It was the contacts which really
                    troubled “our crowd.” At one point I got both groups at the senior working level
                    to agree on worker housing legislation.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: The UIL was the Socialist trade union?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: The UIL was Social Democratic along with a Republican current. And
                    because the ICFTU (International Confederation of Free Trade Unions) accepted
                    them for membership, my activities were tolerated, even though not always
                    appreciated.</p>
                <p>Shea: Who headed up the UIL?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Italo Viglianesi-later to be Minister of Transport as the Christian
                    Democrats weakened and had to look for allies.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Why did you get in trouble [for your contacts with UIL]?</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>MILLEN: Because they were not part of CISL. And then of course there was always
                    the suggestion that the UIL were really laced with crypto-Communists and so
                    forth. It was that they were out of step with what we wanted them to do, which
                    was namely become one unified opposition to the CGIL. When we engineered the
                    separation of CISL from the CGIL, we didn't realize that we were setting in
                    force traditional Mediterranean cultural-political instincts to have multiparty
                    operations. Once you broke a big piece off of CGIL, it was inevitable that
                    smaller pieces were going to come off and try to maintain their own identity and
                    their own political force. Given the AFL's strong plea for unitary unionism,
                    i.e. no dual unionism, it was only natural from our point of view to say, “Well,
                    you can't have two [labor movements]. You've got to have one.” That just went
                    counter to the entire European tradition. The general European mode of operation
                    led to coalition governments as well as trade unions, leaving the door open to
                    Communist domination. It lead to muddied politics, not clear-cut results as
                    exemplified by the American model. All of this is true, of course. We just never
                    realized we could not pull it off.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Who in the Embassy supported your contacts with the UIL?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: To my knowledge, no one on the political side of the Mission. The
                    economic division and many on what we now call the AID Mission, including the
                    Minister, were quite comfortable with my activities. One or two from the CIA
                    seemed quite comfortable and cooperative.</p>
                <p>The UIL contacts came about naturally. I didn't break my neck to do it. And there
                    were people, who were not my superiors and so forth, who were quite happy to see
                    material coming out [of the contacts]. Many people on the economic side of the
                    Embassy felt there was a smell of craziness about the work of the labor section.
                    And a good many of the Consular officers were very realistic in their appraisal
                    of Embassy policies.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Did Tom Lane oppose the contacts?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Yes, but he couldn't say, “You can't do it.” because the ICFTU recognized
                    the UIL and because they were afraid of possible repercussions. They just
                    thought that I shouldn't. I wasn't trying to be an obstructionist or anything. I
                    just thought it came naturally, and I certainly was not in opposition to the
                    CISL. I just thought that if you can't have one organization fighting the
                    Commies, then you had better make use of what tools you have and that was it.
                    UIL, standing alone, could never have been a match for the CGIL. It would have
                    always been an adjunct to the CISL, never a substitute.</p>
                <p>Shea: Pastore headed up the. . .</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Yes, Guilio Pastore was head of CISL. I kind of liked him. He was a
                    short, squat, little fellow. But he never commanded the respect of a DeVittorio,
                    nor could he shape Christian Democratic policy.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>Shea: Do you recall his origin?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: No. That has faded into the past. He was always interested in the
                    development of the south. I can't remember whether that came from part of his
                    origins or whether he just felt that in order to develop Italy had to do
                    something in the south. He was no dummy. He was a respectable guy. Bruno Storti
                    was his deputy and later became [head of CISL]. Bruno was motion picture star
                    handsome. Didn't you think that?</p>
                <p>Shea: Yes, that's right.</p>
                <p>MILLEN: I understand third hand that by 1967 or 1968 Storti had pretty much had
                    it up to the throat with American interference, . . . — because actually we were
                    still monkeying around there — and there was a move for unity among the trade
                    unions.</p>
                <p>Shea: And they were engaged in joint collective bargaining.</p>
                <p>MILLEN: I understand that the AFL-CIO was doing its best to try to block that and
                    were putting up a fair amount of money to stop it.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: To stop the unity?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Yes.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Because they were afraid of Communists and Socialists?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Oh, I suppose so, although I really was amused [sometime] along about
                    1970 [when] I was reading the AFL-CIO News and there was a picture of the UIL
                    General Convention up in Torino and by God there must have been five presidents
                    of AFL-CIO [member unions] in that picture. I thought,”How things have
                    changed!”</p>
                <p>Shea: Five Executive Council members?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Yes, and then of course we had Harry Goldberg there in residence as part
                    of the Lovestone operation.</p>
                <p>Shea: Didn't they have the trade union training school down in Anzio?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: CISL had one up just outside of Florence in the hills.</p>
                <p>Shea: Jazali?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: I am not sure.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>Kienzle: Do you want to describe Harry Goldberg's operations.</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Well, it was too veiled. He floated around. Occasionally he and his wife
                    would invite my wife and me to lunch, and then, as I understand it, he would
                    frequently go back to CISL and talk about my “Communist connections.”</p>
                <p>Kienzle: What was his official position there?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: He was just a representative of the Free Trade Union Committee. I believe
                    that probably would have been his title. He was a likeable and bright guy.</p>
                <p>Shea: And an accomplished musician.</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Yes, a very fine musician. I don't know whether he may still be living,
                    but he was in very bad health.</p>
                <p>Shea: He passed away a few years ago.</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Did he?</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Why did he report back on your activities?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Because they were very unhappy with my contacts and the things I was
                    doing. I never considered these things to be all that important, but they became
                    magnified in the minds of some observers.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Was there any sense that there was a need to keep track of other
                    factions in the trade union movement besides CISL, even if we did not influence
                    them?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: They certainly wanted information about the UIL, and they certainly
                    wanted to keep track of me. We had one fellow in the office who was openly from
                    the [Central Intelligence] Agency. He was a nice fellow. He made no bones about
                    his connection. We worked together and traded information back and forth. Then
                    another fellow was assigned, and interestingly enough my first alert came from
                    [our local] Italian employees in the Mission. “Be careful of this new guy coming
                    in. He is out looking after you.” These employees were from the Mutual Security
                    Agency. How they knew it I don't know, but that was the first warning I got;
                    later I danced with the wife of a CIA employee and she said, “Bruce, be careful.
                    This guy is here primarily just to watch you.”</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Do you think that her husband put up to saying that?</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>MILLEN: No, I don't think so. I was a good friend of her husband's. No, I don't
                    think he put her up to it. I don't think he would have trusted her with that
                    kind of information. Then, interestingly enough, when I was getting ready to
                    leave, the agency wanted to fill my job too. That was when I worked something
                    out with Henry Tasca, who was Deputy Chief of the Mutual Security Agency
                    Mission, and I think also Minister of Economic Affairs in the Embassy, but I am
                    not quite sure of that.</p>
                <p>Shea: Yes, as I recall, he was.</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Well, at any rate, I went to Henry and said, “Hey, Henry, I understand
                    that 'they' are trying to put somebody in my job.” He was startled and said,
                    “How can we stop it?” I said, “They apparently haven't selected anybody yet.
                    There's nobody ready to come right in. Maybe you can fill the job on an 'acting
                    basis' right away.” So he called Ted Long down [to Rome] from Genoa, and Ted
                    took the job [at the Embassy] and stayed in it.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: How did the Agency go about filling those spots at that time?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Well, I don't know. The one that I told you about that I had been alerted
                    to. . . I can't imagine him being very effective in any sense of the word. I
                    heard indirectly that he was not a deep or a great agent. I guess that they
                    selected him on the basis that he had an Italian name and spoke some Italian. He
                    was responsible for vetting some of my reports-in fact stopped one. He succeeded
                    in getting new cars for three CISL officers in central Italy. That type of
                    thing.</p>
                <p>Shea: Bruce, going back to [the subject of] the CGIL, when you went to some of
                    these CGIL rallies, would Togliatti, [head of the Italian Communist Party], put
                    in an appearance?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: No, I never was at a meeting where Togliatti spoke. I think that was part
                    of their game too. They didn't want to juxtapose these two forces.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: They made a distinction between the party and the union?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Yes, I think they were trying to, but nobody was fooled by it. It was for
                    public relations purposes.</p>
                <p>Shea: As I recall, from its very beginning, the CGIL always had a Socialist
                    Assistant Secretary General.</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Yes, the Nenni Socialist Party made common force with the Communists and
                    was also in the CGIL as the main socialist party. They were rewarded with
                    second-level jobs.</p>
                <p>Shea: This would have been Nenni?</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>MILLEN: This would have been Nenni's people. I have forgotten the names of the
                    CGIL people, but [Nenni's people] had the important spots in the CGIL and
                    probably from time to time had considerable influence. There was no question
                    that the Communists controlled the operation.</p>
                <p>Well, we have talked so much about this covert phase and I don't want to leave
                    the impression that that's all which occupied me. It took up only about ten
                    percent of my time, but because I was right in the middle of it, it loomed as a
                    very important part of the picture. I think we did some good things: that school
                    in Fiesole and some of those things.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Did you have other duties besides labor?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Indirectly, yes. I worked with the Economic Aid Mission closely. I sat on
                    their loan committee, and I think I had some influence there, partly because of
                    the political information that I had about individual plants where loans were
                    being directed. I got involved to some extent in the cooperative situation.
                    There again, Tom Lane had a certain instinct for what was important in a
                    political sense. He said one day, “You know, we don't know much about the
                    Italian cooperative movement. Why don't you look into it.” So I wrote a very
                    extensive report on it. Of course, it was almost a mirror image of the trade
                    union situation, but to my knowledge nobody had ever touched on the subject
                    before. The Communist Cooperative Movement was strong, healthy and so forth, and
                    organized much like the CGIL. I did work with the productivity committee, as
                    well as general economic work.</p>
                <p>Shea: It was particularly strong in the Emilia Romagna.</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Yes, there farm cooperatives and everything were very [strong]. The other
                    parties had matching organizations, which were about as effective as [their
                    counterparts] in the trade union field. Bang! This report hit Washington and
                    within a month we had a special group out on co-ops.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Did we support co-ops?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Just to figure out what we could do and how we could strengthen them, as
                    far as I know, but in Italy, who knows?. Interestingly enough San Severino, the
                    Professoresa, was a consultant to the Christian Democratic Cooperative Movement.
                    She was a professor at Pisa. She would go up there two or three times a year “to
                    take examinations.” What she meant was to give exams. I have no knowledge she
                    ever met a class, but that would be part and parcel of an Italian university.
                    You know, they don't have enough seats to seat all their students if they came
                    to class. It is not like an American university set up. You are pretty much on
                    your own. You are an independent scholar and that is one reason why to this day
                    relatively few people get university degrees.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Shea: Yes, I can attest to that because I was a student at the University of
                    Perugia for a while. Bruce, do you remember when Abe Kramer was there?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Oh, yes. This is an interesting story. For three years I was not
                    permitted to go to Torino, Pisa, or Trieste, because those were Tom's private
                    bailiwicks.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Any particular reason for that?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Well, in Pisa he had set up a dual dock union, which was really run-I may
                    be oversimplifying here-out of the prefect's office. They selected the people
                    who would load and unload American ships. That was one of the major debarkation
                    points for both our troops and supplies going into Austria. So in a security
                    sense it was very important.</p>
                <p>Shea: That was at Livorno?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Yes. So Tom Lane had established this separate section of the Dock
                    Workers which was pretty much a CISL operation with the prefect running the
                    show. I guess that was considered to be too delicate for me to go into it. For
                    the first two or three years, I was just not permitted to go. So Tom went up
                    there one day and the newspapers mentioned that he was up in Livorno/Pisa. He
                    was a public figure. I am not quite sure what the problem was but among other
                    things, the leadership needed more money. I think that's what it was. So he went
                    up there. He never told us or anybody about what went on. Well, Kramer was in
                    town at that time, and Irving Brown was in the Flora Hotel. So the same guys who
                    met with Tom on Tuesday met with Irving Brown on Thursday. They told Brown that
                    they didn't get much from Lane and so forth, so Brown upped the ante. Kramer was
                    at the Brown meeting and told me about it.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: How did he do that? What was the mechanism?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Keeping matters and finances straight in so far as activities of the CIA
                    and their surrogates [are concerned] is beyond my ken [capacity]. I don't know
                    what the mechanism was, but obviously he and Lane were in great competition.</p>
                <p>Shea: Kramer, as I recall, was brought down from Germany.</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Well, he went into Trieste, because that was a special flash point. There
                    was a lot of labor activity in the port, even though it was a declining
                    port.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>One final anecdote about the Italian scene, and then let's move on. I tell this
                    simply to demonstrate CGIL-CP methods and tactics versus those of CISL. Probably
                    in 1954 or 1955, CGIL ran a most impressive and economically devastating farm
                    strike in Ferrara, north of Bologna. Day after day, newspapers in Rome of all
                    political persuasions carried front page stories. It was fast becoming an
                    important political issue with the Socialists and the Communists playing the
                    story for everything possible. The economic issues have long been lost to my
                    memory.</p>
                <p>I went to Ferrara for three days to see developments first hand and spent most of
                    two days with two fine CISL representatives who were overwhelmed by events-and
                    frankly they were more than a little frightened in as much as they had to flee
                    from the rear as the CGIL supporters broke in the front. Farmers were afraid to
                    go out to milk their cows; animals were being shipped out of the province;
                    cattle were going un fed. The CGIL mounted demonstrations led by pregnant
                    women.</p>
                <p>Initially the police had bicycles for transport while the strikers used
                    motor-scooters. Jeeps were brought in for the police, but the strikers ripped up
                    the loose planking which formed the road service for many of the small streams.
                    I felt the isolation of the CISL forces and was stunned when, in thanking me for
                    my visit and attention [one of them] said, “Tell some of the CISL leaders we
                    need help. Some of our people from CISL should visit us.”</p>
                <p>The dispute was resolved a few days later under terms virtually identical to a
                    set of recommendations I made to Minister Tasca upon my return. Cause and
                    effect? Who knows?</p>
                <p>So that's it. Why don't we move on to another country? Suffice it to say that
                    Lane gave no consideration to economic issues or the work of economic
                    development. I did not even consult with him on issues in this area.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Okay. Well, how long were you in Italy?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Three and a half years.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: So you were there until about 1954?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: I left in about October 1954.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Where did you go from there?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Then I went to Norway. It was such a contrast!</p>
                <p>Kienzle: How would you characterize the differences?</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>MILLEN: Well, one of my old friends who worked with me in Rome, but was
                    [actually] stationed in Paris, was the Mutual Security Administration's chief
                    guy in Norway. This was a small operation with about five people involved at
                    that time. We were talking and I wanted to get something done, and he said,
                    “Bruce, you are not in Italy. You can go from point A to point B with no problem
                    at all. You don't have to go through points C and D to get to point B.”</p>
                <p>Kienzle: So you were able to free-wheel a good deal more?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Well, first of all, 90 percent of the anti-Communist stuff we could leave
                    to the Norwegian Labor Party. I did a few little things that they asked me to
                    do, or I thought might be worthwhile in that direction, but it was a pretty
                    straight-forward kind of thing. They wanted some special information, or if they
                    wanted something taken care of that I could do, we would do it. They once asked
                    me to visit one of the Communist strong points up in northern Norway.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: “They” being the Labor Party?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Yes, the Labor Party and Haakon [Lie]. He asked me to go up there. He
                    said, “You know, those idiots are up there blaming Americans for everything, and
                    they have never ever seen one. Would you go up there and show them what an
                    American is?” So I went up there, and they had a seminar or some sort of a
                    training session going on. So I spent two or three days with them and I found it
                    very enjoyable. They would come up to my room later and argue politics and drink
                    my scotch.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: The Communists?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Well, the whole group. They weren't all Communists. They would fight over
                    issues in my hotel room. Other than showing the flag, my role was just to be a
                    kind of an interlocutor so to speak.</p>
                <p>It was interesting. One of the things [I found]-and this was true in Italy as
                    well as in Norway and in fact all the countries I was in-was that one of your
                    chief sources of information and one of the areas where you could introduce
                    ideas and so forth was through academic circles. And in Norway, in contrast to
                    Italy, the employers invited my participation in their events and listened to me
                    and talked frankly about issues and so forth. In Italy that never took place.
                    Some of the individual staff economists in Italy were interesting and useful,
                    but the officers would never deign to sit down and talk to somebody in my
                    position, while in Norway everything was reduced in scale because it is a small
                    country. But it was also a highly democratic country. I used Bob Flemming as my
                    entry point to the Norsk Arbeidsgiver Forening (Norwegian Employers Federation)
                    or NAF. [To Jim Shea] Remember Bob Flemming?</p>
                <p>Shea: Oh, yes</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>MILLEN: Anyway he was later President of the University of Michigan, but at that
                    time he was at [the University of] Illinois. He was a lawyer and arbitrator and
                    mediator. I used his visit as a point of entre with the employers, and they were
                    delighted to see me and maintain contact with me. I put out a little bulletin in
                    Norway called “Labor News in America.” We did it by offset press. I was talking
                    with the Director of the Employers Association once, and he said, “Bruce, I am
                    not trying to impose censorship, but you know that right now the issue of the
                    forty hour week is before Parliament. Could you stay away from that subject?” He
                    said, “You don't know what that paper does? You put something in that paper and
                    we've got a demand within twenty days from some place in this country for
                    contract conditions you have in the United States.” He said this with absolute
                    good humor. “You must know that the 40 hour week in the United States was, in
                    part, a job creation effort; here we have less than two percent unemployment.
                    The 40 hour week will come. Give us some time.”</p>
                <p>The difference between Italy and Norway is illustrated by the relationship I had
                    with the Norwegian Employers' Federation. It was marked by almost complete
                    openness as the prior exchange illustrated. The Deputy Director once told me
                    that one of the proudest moments in his life took place when he was a regional
                    director in Stravanger. It seems that his union counterparts and his group had
                    worked several days on negotiating a series of amendments to a contract and the
                    pressures had been intense. When the issues had finally been resolved, the chief
                    union negotiator said, “I must make this next train. Would you put this series
                    of agreements in final form and see that they are distributed to my members and
                    yours so there are no further delays.” The director told me, “I was humbled and
                    honored at such trust being placed in my hands.”</p>
                <p>Finally, I should say, based on my Italian experience, I was somewhat wary about
                    approaching the NAF (Norwegian Employers Federation). Finally, my reservations
                    were overcome by the chief economist for the trade union federation, who told me
                    I must avail myself of the opportunity. He said, “They have excellent people and
                    far more resources than we. You would be doing yourself a disservice by
                    neglecting the group.” How right he was! Kienzle: What kind of work week did
                    they have in Norway at that point?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: I think they had a forty-four hour work week. They started right after
                    World War II with a forty-eight hour week, and they had gotten it down to a
                    forty-four and the unions wanted to go to forty. The employers knew that
                    eventually they would go to forty. It was simply a question of when, one year or
                    three.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Eliminating Saturday morning work?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Yes.</p>
                <p>Shea: Who was our ambassador [to Norway] then?</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>MILLEN: Coren Strong, who was a great socialite and had quite a bit of money. He
                    was a very decent guy. Once he got accustomed to the fact that I didn't wear
                    horns, we got along very well. In fact he used to boast to some people that he
                    had personally selected me.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: What kind of professional background did he have?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Really it was hard to tell. The thing that gave him most satisfaction was
                    his Army time. I have forgotten what kind of a unit he worked with. He inherited
                    his money. He was an orphan, and he was brought into the Eastman Kodak clan, I
                    think, and that was the source of his money. His wife was a martinet but smart.
                    Oh, gosh, she was smart, and she cracked the whip. She told the ladies, “The
                    Ambassador wants a tight ship here.” But he was a sweet fellow and it was always
                    fun to be around him.</p>
                <p>Shea: How did he regard the Socialists?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: He seemed to be above that. The Socialists didn't bother him. I remember
                    once I convinced him to give a party on Labor Day for the Executive Council of
                    the Norwegian Trade Union Confederation, which had about 55 or 60 members. They
                    met quarterly, and were to meet prior to Labor Day. I convinced him to throw a
                    party. We got the invitations up, and we invited the wives although we knew that
                    not many of them would be there. We sent out the invitations three weeks in
                    advance, so they would get the invitations at their homes, because that
                    gilt-edged invitation is good coffee time talk in these small towns up above the
                    Arctic Circle. So then the only issue was that there was still one Communist
                    member of the Executive Council. What were we going to do with him? And I said,
                    “Let's invite him. We'll get brownie points from the Norwegians and he won't
                    come.” And he didn't. It was a good party, and the Ambassador was quite happy
                    about it.</p>
                <p>It is the members of the Foreign Service who sometimes give you problems. The
                    last day I was at the Embassy-The next day I was to pack up and the day after
                    that sail-I was sitting behind a screen in an empty office and filling out some
                    papers, and the personnel officer came in to interview a prospective Norwegian
                    for a job. The whole thrust of the interview was to try to elicit whether that
                    [applicant] was a member of the Labor Party, and it was quite clear that he
                    wouldn't be hired [if he was]. You would think that by some process of osmosis
                    people would become civilized. This [personnel officer] was displaying all the
                    God-damned prejudices and nuttiness of big organizations. They left [the room]
                    before I did, and they never knew that I was there. Later I said to the
                    [personnel officer], “You know, if that guy were to repeat the questions from
                    the interview you were giving him, we would be in real trouble around here. Our
                    friendly relations with the Labor Party could break down on the issue of our
                    trying to keep Labor Party people off our [Embassy] payroll.”</p>
                <p>Kienzle: What kind of position was he being recruited for?</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>MILLEN: Oh, I don't know. Just a routine job.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Was he to work for the Political Section?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: No, no, no.</p>
                <p>Shea: Was the ambassador aware of this?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: No, these were individual employees responding to the unstated objectives
                    of their bosses, which just goes to show you the pervasive atmosphere in
                    institutional life.</p>
                <p>Shea: How was the Political Counselor?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: We had two while I was there. Stratton Anderson was in charge of the two
                    person Political Section. By way of comparison the Political Research Office-the
                    Agency-had four people. The Deputy Chief of Mission was Hayden Raynor for most
                    of the period. Hayden Raynor was a nice fellow. He was not a world-breaker or
                    anything like that but competent and truly cooperative after he took my
                    measure.</p>
                <p>Shea: Did he clear off on your dispatches?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: I was in the Economic Section which was a friendlier place, where, for
                    the most part, my supervisors were most helpful. The first thing I wrote at
                    Embassy Oslo was slapped back at me. It was a report on the first strike in 25
                    years held by the Norwegian Labor Movement.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: 25 years!</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Well, at least since the prewar [period]. This was 1955, and I had not
                    been in the country two months before the Transport Workers Union struck Esso.
                    [Earlier] I spent two years of my life trying to organize an Esso refinery. [The
                    Norwegian Transport Workers Union] had Esso organized to the point where Esso
                    apologized to the union because it kept white collar workers on the payroll who
                    were not striking.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Esso in general was anti-union.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>MILLEN: Well, in the United States Esso had company unions. Legally you can't say
                    that they were company unions, but for all intents and purposes when I was
                    working with them they were just that. So I wrote the report, and I had among
                    other things a report written by the Employers Association that I was working
                    from, but I didn't include it in my report. I just extracted parts. I couldn't
                    read even “beginning” Norwegian at that time, so anything I got had to be
                    translated. I took a few hundred words out of that report and included them here
                    and there in the report that I wrote, and it came back to me. The Political
                    Counselor had given it to the Deputy Chief of Mission saying, “He is biased.”
                    There upon I had the whole fucking report translated, and I just said, “In
                    regard to the report to which somebody took exception, I submit this internal
                    report from the Employers Association.” That was the last I ever heard of it. My
                    report went to wherever it was supposed to go, and nobody ever raised the
                    question of biased reporting again.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: In what sense did they think you were biased?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Well, I guess they thought that I was too pro-union and anti-Esso.</p>
                <p>Shea: Was the Norwegian labor movement highly organized?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Oh, yes. It was not as high as Sweden, but it was over 50 percent.</p>
                <p>Shea: Do you recall the Secretary General of the Norwegian [Trade Union
                    Federation].</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Konrad Nordahl. He was a very interesting personality. He was a former
                    member, I think, of the Communist Party, and the Norwegian Party had been a
                    member of the Second and One-Half International for a short period. He couldn't
                    get a passport for the United States, because of that connection. In any event
                    the only way he could come to the United States was on diplomatic credentials as
                    a delegate to the United Nations and so forth. [After] I had been there a couple
                    of years, I went to him and said, “Konrad, would you like to go to the United
                    States legally sometime.” He said, “I'd love it.” He didn't say it [quite] that
                    way because his mode of expression was more formal. So I started the process of
                    getting an exception to the Attorney General's list or whatever it was
                    called.</p>
                <p>Shea: The Attorney General's waiver list.</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Of course about half way through this [waiver process for Nordahl] I got
                    request after request for more information about him from different [people] and
                    I thought to myself, “Boy, if this doesn't go through, I'm in real trouble.”
                    Anyway it took about three months and finally [the waiver was granted]. I went
                    over that afternoon and said to Konrad, “You are as pure as driven snow,
                    Konrad.” He grinned. He was a tough guy. I think he was one of the strongest men
                    I have ever met. His demeanor frightened people.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>Kienzle: Physically or emotionally?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: In his capacity to control events. He ruled that place with an iron hand.
                    Some of his assistant officers, or assistant “foreman” as they are called, used
                    to come to me to take messages to him, because they would say, “He gets along
                    with you, and you are a foreigner, and he won't get mad, so would you sound him
                    out about this? And if he doesn't react too badly, I'll take it back on my
                    own.”</p>
                <p>Kienzle: What were his policy priorities that they felt so hesitant to deal with
                    him on directly?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: First of all, he was a tightwad; he didn't want any money spent;
                    secondly, on matters of collective bargaining and legislative strategy. I don't
                    know what it is like now, but [at that time] they had an extremely centralized
                    bargaining process. [The leaders] had to approve every contract, and they could
                    end a strike or they could start a strike. They could call the whole movement
                    out if they wanted to. If the metal workers had a strike, after two weeks strike
                    support funds automatically came from Denmark and Sweden, as part of any
                    agreement [made back] in the 1910's. So it was very highly centralized.</p>
                <p>Shea: Were there many figures from the resistance movement in the trade
                    movement?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Yes, I knew quite a few of them. There was an amusing story. I don't know
                    whether you want it on tape or not</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Go right ahead.</p>
                <p>MILLEN: It has nothing to do with what we are taking about, but one of my friends
                    at 31 [years of age] was Assistant Director of the Bank of Norway-a former
                    German prisoner. The problem was that he tried to run the country from that
                    position. He tried to tell the Finance Minister [what to do] and so forth, so he
                    finally got bounced out but later became what they called a junior cabinet
                    minister. He was minister for prices and wages. He was an entertaining fellow.
                    His brother was my closest friend, but I knew Gunnar pretty well.</p>
                <p>After I had been overseas someplace, I went back [to Norway] for a visit. I used
                    to try to take two or three days vacation in Norway on the way home. This was
                    one of those occasions and a friend of mine set up a dinner for me at his house.
                    His wife was part Indonesian [and served] good Indonesian food. Gunnar was among
                    the guests and along about 10 o'clock, he said he had a cabinet meeting in the
                    morning and he should be alert and so forth. I knew that Gunnar was not going to
                    his hotel room, so we made a date for lunch the next day at one o'clock. Well,
                    Gunnar was late; Norwegians are never late. So he came in about 15 minutes late
                    and apologized. He said, “I had to return to my room and change my linen.”
                    That's the way he talked. So he said, “You know I sat in the back of the room
                    with my dark beard and so forth.”</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>I said, “Gunnar, I didn't know that the Norwegian Cabinet gave any concern about
                    the sinful activities of its members.” He said, “Normally they don't, but the
                    entire quota for the entire cabinet is being used up by the Minister of
                    Agriculture at this time.” So then I said, “Oh, that explains the hurried visit
                    of the Minister of Agriculture a couple months ago to the United States over for
                    a weekend.” He came because his girlfriend was a U.N. delegate. Gunnar didn't
                    know that, so we traded [information].</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Did you have much contact with the government ministers for labor or
                    other related subjects?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Interestingly enough, the Labor Minister in Norway doesn't have a great
                    deal to do with labor. [The ministry] used to be the Ministry for Communal
                    Affairs and Labor. They ran a job placement [service] and things like that, but
                    the ministry does not have much to do with labor policy. The Ministry of
                    Commerce had more to do with labor, because so much of the Norwegian economy was
                    based on exports, and it was always interested in getting wage settlements. And
                    the trade unions were too. This is the interesting thing. When they went into
                    negotiations this was one thing that they can do with the centralized
                    bargaining. They could get a reading from the Minister of Finance and the
                    Minister of Commerce, and set their demands in such a way that they would have
                    the least impact on wage costs and so forth. But every once in a while they
                    would find themselves in a position where they would have to say, “Look, we've
                    had too long a stand still. We can't claim to be representative of our members
                    if we don't get something out of these negotiations.”</p>
                <p>I was once asked to sit in on the meeting between the Labor Party and the trade
                    unions on hammering out wage policy, and I turned it down. I said, “I don't
                    think that I want to be seen there. I don't think you want me to be seen there.”
                    Then whoever asked me said, “Yes, maybe you're right.”</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Did they have a purpose in inviting you?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: No, they just said, “Well, we want you to know what goes on around
                    here.”</p>
                <p>Kienzle: It would be interesting to be a mouse in such a meeting.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>MILLEN: Yes. Well, Murray Weisz once visited Norway at the time of the Labor
                    Party convention. And there was a surprise. [Usually] these things are so well
                    organized in Norway that you don't get surprises, but some guy proposed a
                    resolution from the floor [restricting] the use of nuclear weapons, which was
                    [quickly] passed. I couldn't believe my ears. I thought, “Well, my Norwegian
                    isn't that good. I missed it. No, nothing of that significance could go through
                    that quickly without any discussion.” Murray and I immediately went over to the
                    Labor Party office after that meeting and listened as top party and government
                    officials discussed [the resolution]. “How the hell are we going to handle this
                    thing.” It was for real. One person suggested, “Well, why don't we just leave it
                    out of the minutes?”</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Was this a “nuclear free zone” type of proposal?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Yes. And of course that idea was batted down right away. “You can't do
                    that. First of all, we would get caught. . . “ For a minute almost a hysteria
                    took over. It was a bizarre moment.</p>
                <p>But on another occasion, a trade union convention, I helped to write the
                    resolution on [use of] nuclear power. I sat with the party guy who was
                    responsible for preparing it, and we worked it out. It was more his than mine,
                    but I contributed to it.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Was it for the use of nuclear power?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Well, yes. It was [really for] the status quo. There was opposition from
                    the floor on it, but Konrad Nordahl was tough in the way he handled this issue.
                    At that very moment when he was on the floor making it clear that there was
                    going to be no deviation from the established policy, my chair broke and I
                    collapsed. I was so embarrassed, and of course I had in the back of my mind,
                    “Jesus Christ, I helped to write this thing.” [Laughter]</p>
                <p>Shea: What about foreign visitors? Especially for the AFL-CIO?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: We had our fair share. Irving [Brown from the AFL-CIO office in Paris]
                    came there. I was fairly helpful to him on that occasion. I think he began to
                    realize for the first time that I was a human being.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Did he work at all through you on this visit?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: No, except at the edges.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Or did he arrange everything privately or through the trade unions?</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>MILLEN: Yes. He would set it up and I would find out through the papers when he
                    was coming. He wasn't very active up in Norway. After all, there wasn't much for
                    him to do. The Norwegian Labor Party had reduced the Communist vote from ten
                    percent to less than three percent. The Labor Party [controlled] all of the
                    presses for the Communist Party press and so forth through loans. They provided
                    it unpaid for years because they thought it would be bad public relations if
                    they yanked the presses away from the Communist Party. People might think that
                    the Labor Party was undemocratic. So there was not a great deal for Irving to do
                    about Norway itself. He had his own contacts built up over the years.</p>
                <p>Now, I remember once the cooperative movement people came to me and said that
                    they were in a bind because a delegate from the Soviet Union and a delegate from
                    China were coming to their convention, and they had no indication that anybody
                    was coming from the United States. So I wired, and we got somebody there. I had
                    hardly sent the wire sent and I received an answer that a guy out of Minnesota
                    would be there.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Did you advise Washington that they might be Communist delegations
                    there?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: I told them. I said that the cooperative movement [had invited the Soviet
                    and Chinese delegates] and I assume that the [Central Intelligence] Agency sent
                    this guy [from Minnesota]. He was an outstanding fellow. That was kind of a
                    harmless little thing; in fact it was handy at that time.</p>
                <p>You know, we talk about the [Central Intelligence] Agency. Sometimes they do a
                    lot of things that we are grateful for.</p>
                <p>Shea: The Norwegians were always very active in the international trade
                    secretariats.</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Oh, yes. Historically this was a longstanding thing. Before the Second
                    World War they did it too. Once I stopped in Belgium just before an ICFTU
                    [International Confederation of Free Trade Unions] convention, and of course I
                    went to see the American delegation at the Metropol [Hotel] and a couple of
                    other snazzy hotels. I went to visit the Norwegian delegation, and there was
                    Konrad Nordahl and his boys in hotel which at best was second class.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: I don't think Irving [Brown] went second class anywhere!</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Oh, no, not Irving. But I'm talking about all the officers and top staff
                    of the Norwegian labor movement. Nordahl really was parsimonious.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: How long were you in Norway?</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>MILLEN: I was there just about three and a half years. I left in June 1958
                    because I was selected that year to go to university [training]. Incidentally
                    after Ambassador Strong left, we had Frances. . .,who was the first woman
                    ambassador that we ever had. She went to Switzerland. A very fine person. It
                    bothers me not to remember her last name. She was excellent and most supportive
                    of my efforts.</p>
                <p>Shea: She went to Oslo?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Yes, she went to Oslo after Ambassador Strong, and was there a couple of
                    years. She was very supportive of me personally. In fact, she called me in when
                    she arrived and said, “I did something that I very seldom do, but I have to let
                    you know that I did it.” She said, “When Hayden, the Deputy Chief of Mission,
                    was in Paris, as I was preparing to go home and come back here, he told me that
                    he thought you were being moved out, and he thought that you should stay. So I
                    asked the Department to retain you here. I did it without asking you and I
                    apologize for that.” She was always very helpful to me.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: So she extended you from a two year to a three year tour?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Well, as it turned out, she didn't want me to go when I left at the end
                    of three years or three and a half years. I saw this opportunity [for university
                    study]. She said, “But I'll request that it be picked up when you do leave
                    here.” I said, “You know this bureaucracy. You can never count on them to come
                    through, and I now have the opportunity.” She was a little pissed off but she
                    got over it. Well, I used to drop in and see her at the United Nations
                    occasionally, and she would take me to lunch. She was a first class woman. I
                    later saw her in Ceylon when I was doing research for the Brookings
                    [Institution]. Did you know that I spent a year or so at Bookings? But first, a
                    final note on Norway.</p>
                <p>Before dropping the subject of Norway, it seems appropriate to mention the covert
                    side. This is particularly true in view of what I said about the Italian
                    situation. In Norway many covert operations were started as a result of war time
                    activities. The stories told me by the head of the maritime union and his
                    activities in American ports were fascinating. Others had ties to the OSS In
                    1956 or 1957 one friend told me Foreign Minister Lange warned people to be
                    careful in their dealings with American friends-that times were changing. By the
                    mid-1950s the situation was contained and the Communists have been driven out of
                    most spots of importance. They had one member on the L.O. [Norwegian Trade Union
                    Federation] National Council (Representskap) and a few members in the
                    Parliament, the Storting, and some influence in specific local unions. The Labor
                    Party occasionally found their votes on domestic issues in the Parliament useful
                    and on foreign policy matters made use of non-Labor Party support. My main role
                    was acting as a sounding board on issues, foreign and domestic.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>I was responsive within the Embassy to a fairly large number of requests for
                    specific information directed to me through the DCM which obviously originated
                    from the Agency. I had a social relationship with one couple which was open and
                    above board. He pumped me for information as I did him, e.g. his fake
                    association with the Newspaper Guild provided by the union. But there was
                    nothing untoward, except on one occasion, when he used as an explanation for
                    breaking security on a matter most embarrassing to me by the use of the standard
                    ploy, “We were working for a higher goal.” On another occasion he jarred me with
                    his threat to the future career of one of our political officers, because, as he
                    so delicately phrased it, “. . . we keep the books.” Stories of this nature were
                    rife throughout the Department of State, but I had reason to recall it ten years
                    later when somewhat the same language was directed at me via a third party close
                    to the Agency.</p>
                <p>From the above, it is clear that the situation in Norway was a far cry from that
                    of Italy. A cadre of strong, disciplined leaders from the unions and the
                    Norwegian Labor Party did most of the job on their own. Many had had a dalliance
                    with the Communists and rejected it as being a variance with the Norwegian “will
                    for democracy,” which suffused most of the Norwegian political left. This made
                    for an ideal situation for me as Labor Attach�. I had immediate access wherever
                    I went. The General Secretary of the Labor Party once, when asked if he wanted
                    to talk to our Ambassador on some subject, replied, “When I want to speak to
                    your ambassador, you will represent me. The Russian Ambassador once complained
                    to the General Secretary about the attention I received and a lesser level
                    embassy type spoke to reporters about how frequently my name and picture
                    appeared in the Labor Party and trade union press. One can understand why I
                    found this assignment so rewarding.</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Now to Brookings. I did a book for them, The Political Role of Labor in
                    Developing Countries.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: That was after your tour in Norway?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: That was after my tour at [the University of] Wisconsin. I finished at
                    Wisconsin in 1958 and was assigned to the Department [of State]. In the summer
                    of 1961 I went to the Brookings [Institution]. A lot of people said. “You
                    shouldn't do that! You are outside the promotion chain, particularly after
                    having been away just a year [earlier].” By that time I was having reservations
                    about the Department of State anyway.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Was your year at the University of Wisconsin in labor studies?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Yes.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: In the famous school there?</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>MILLEN: No, that school was for mainly trade union people. No, I was in the
                    Graduate School of Economics. That was a good year too and it was very useful to
                    me. It was absolutely essential . . . (End of Side B, tape One)</p>
                <p>The experience a Brookings was so fine, because I really had the feeling that
                    Brookings was a collegial body, and everyone treated me as though I were a
                    member of the staff. I would attend staff meetings. I would sit in on all the
                    meetings that involved their internal workings, and if they had a visitor from
                    Italy, for example, they would invite me to sit in on it and so forth.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Could you describe the project which you undertook there?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Well, it was started by Ben Stephansky, and of course he was going to
                    base it on Latin America. He and Phil Kaiser. Phil was teaching at that time at
                    American University.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Along with Murray Weisz?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Well, Murray was teaching there too, and I had also been there a little
                    bit. Ben had hardly started [the project] when he [was nominated to be] an
                    ambassador. Both he and Phil [were nominated] after the election of John F.
                    Kennedy. Ben really hadn't done much [on the project], so they suggested that I
                    do it and Brookings agreed to change venue to underdeveloped countries, India,
                    the Near East, Africa, and so forth. Without that year at the University of
                    Wisconsin, I could never have done the work at Brookings.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: What years were those?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Well, the Wisconsin years were the academic year 1958-1959, and then the
                    Bookings years were the summer of 1961 to the fall of 1962. [I wrote] a short
                    book. I did all the research and the whole process of [writing] the book by May
                    of 1963. The book was in print and in my hand [by then].</p>
                <p>Kienzle: What is the title of the book?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: The Political Role of Labor in Developing Countries.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: And the Publisher?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Brookings. Like so many books written at that time about economic
                    development, it was overly optimistic. Once you start the game [of economic
                    development], there was a kind of an automatic process.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: The Rostow approach?</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>MILLEN: Yes, that's right. I remember that [Rostow's book] was one of the books I
                    read just after I finished the project, and it sustained me in this kind of rosy
                    glow of things, but I don't think I was unusual among people writing in those
                    days. [However], I did identify the problems of tribalism and the problems of
                    development as opposed to wages and so forth.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Did you make field trips to the area?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Yes, I spent seven weeks in Africa and Ceylon. The Rockefeller Foundation
                    gave Brookings $10,000 in support of the project. The way it was set up the Ford
                    Foundation gave a permanent grant to Brookings. My office rent, supplies, and
                    administrative expenses came out of the Ford Foundation grant to Brookings. My
                    travel and a part time research assistant, etc., came out of the Rockefeller
                    money. They even had enough money to take about $400 or $500 and apply it toward
                    the printing costs. That's how far $10,000 could take you then.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: After Brookings, what did you do?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Then I went to India.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: At some point you worked in NEA [Bureau of Near Eastern and South Asian
                    Affairs, Department of State]?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: That was between Wisconsin and Brookings.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Do you want to describe your duties as the Labor Advisor?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: In NEA, I sometimes thought maybe I was the conscience of the
                    organization. I did my best. I helped the Peace Corps get into the region,
                    because I convinced everybody that I should sign off on all outgoing telegrams
                    unless they involved a policy matter. This meant that about nine-tenths of all
                    the bureaucratic chit-chat could go through without having to be cleared by all
                    the [country desks]. In various ways I tried to make life easier for them. One
                    of the higher ups wanted me to come to work for [the Peace Corps] . I said,
                    “Look, I like the Peace Corps, but I don't like it as a 24 hour [a day] matter.
                    It's going to be great for the Americans who go over. I'm not sure what the long
                    term impact is going to be abroad, but I think it is a marvelous experience for
                    those who participate. But that's not my life.” I also warned my special contact
                    about infiltration which lead to meetings between Director Shriver and Allen
                    Dulles.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Any other notable things occur in the labor field during that time?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Yes.</p>
                <p>Shea: Did you get a chance to visit many of the countries in the region?</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>MILLEN: Oh, yes. Greece, Israel, Egypt, Aden, Ceylon. . . There was one big
                    blow-up, which the State Department had so much difficulty understanding, and
                    that was when Paul Hall. . .</p>
                <p>Shea: The Seafarers Union.</p>
                <p>MILLEN: The Seafarers Union. Paul Hall called some sort of a job action. I have
                    forgotten what it was [all about]. I guess he wanted to pull his crews off the
                    ships in the [Suez] Canal, and the Arab League responded with a boycott of all
                    American ships. It caused a big flurry, and before I even knew this had
                    happened, the desk officers, the one for Egypt in particular, called the
                    National Labor Relations Board to see how this law could be called null and void
                    or whatever. So by the time I heard about it they had already muddied the
                    waters, but it was obvious that the NLRB had nothing to do with it. Tensions
                    between the Egyptians and the Seafarers' Union got awfully high. The Egyptian
                    Labor Attach�, who was a really nice guy, was sitting on my doorstep, and
                    finally Arthur Goldberg, who by this time was Counsel for the Steelworkers, got
                    involved. Goldberg stepped in and there was a controversy over that because one
                    key document that he was responsible for turning out dropped a key sentence, and
                    the accusation was made that he was really a crook at heart. Anyway, it finally
                    settled down and I wrote a big report on [the incident], which surprisingly
                    enough was fairly well accepted-after the fact..</p>
                <p>Not long after that I went to Egypt and met with the Egyptian trade union people
                    about it. I don't think that I convinced them a bit of anything, but there was
                    some high comedy. I remember that I went to see the Egyptian Ambassador in his
                    office one morning, and his point to me was: “In my country, they should all be
                    put in jail.” [Laughter] Here was a guy who was educated in France and spent
                    most of his life in Western countries including ours. His response was: “They
                    should all be in jail.” I also saw Paul Hall about it. This was the only time I
                    ever had any contacts with him.</p>
                <p>Shea: This was when Nasser was in power?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: No, this was after Nasser. This would have been 1961. But I did meet Paul
                    Hall in the process, and that was interesting. He was a really flamboyant
                    personality and I would say, at times almost lovable. Part of the problem was
                    that Paul Hall was married to a Jewish woman, and that didn't help the matter.
                    [Anyway, he] said, “For Christ sake, I just acted like a trade union leader.
                    They were fucking my guys up and I responded like any trade union would.”</p>
                <p>Kienzle: What were they doing? Were they stopping ships in the Canal in some
                    way?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: I think they were messing them up when they went ashore. There were a lot
                    of personal attacks and so forth. It's all dim in my memory now.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Were there other highlights of the NEA tour that you recall?</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>MILLEN: Oh, just the little petty stuff. Actually there were some friendly people
                    there. Some of the people on the India desk were really great: Wes Adams. He was
                    a very liberal guy. And [there were] others. Well, the things that happened. . .
                    Again in a big bureaucracy. Bob Senser was just coming in, and the Department
                    wanted to send him to India. Well, at that time he had a black wife, and
                    somebody up in personnel passed the word that he would be totally unacceptable
                    in India, because Indians would not accept [someone of] color.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Was that true?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Well, some of the Indians were sensitive to the issue, yes, but not to
                    the extent that you couldn't send somebody there. At any rate, I went down to
                    the desk, and I think almost universally Bernie Horgan, Wes Adams-There were
                    about six guys working on the Indian Desk at that time-and they asked, “Who
                    passed out that kind of information?' They said, “Sure, maybe down south there
                    might be a little bit of a problem, but are we in the business of sending people
                    out there to please the prejudices of a few Indians?” So again, somebody up high
                    thinks that he's got wisdom and you get this kind of a response. Well, as it
                    turned out, Bob Senser went some place else. I've forgotten [where]. But these
                    are some examples of the interesting things that happen in a bureaucracy.</p>
                <p>Looking back on the NEA experience really revealed some of the weaknesses of the
                    Labor Attach� Program. The Paul Hall issue, for example, bordered on turning
                    into an incendiary affair and yet my Bureau made very little use of the Labor
                    Advisor, me, and I was kept away from the policy decisions. Furthermore, the
                    AFL-CIO, Arthur Goldberg, etc. made not a single contact with the one person
                    within NEA who might have been able to help the unions extract themselves from a
                    very sticky situation.</p>
                <p>I recognized from the outset that NEA, because of the political nature of their
                    client states, the Israel issue, etc. represented a difficult area within which
                    to work, and my fears were realized quite soon. Despite the high quality of many
                    members of the staff, and even the desire of some of them to be helpful, the
                    Labor Advisor had little leverage. Doing day-to-day chores were easy, but
                    trouble arose whenever I raised issues outside of the immediate and most narrow
                    definition of my function. For example, through happenstance I became friendly
                    with a Deputy Assistant Secretary at the Department of Interior and uncovered a
                    program designed to foster the development of water desalinization in arid
                    countries. Efforts to raise discussion of the program with NEA were frowned upon
                    within my immediate office and I came close to being reprimanded.</p>
                <p>Another instance: A brief memorandum to the NEA Assistant Secretary pointing out
                    a weakness in a speech by the Secretary of State, which appeared in the
                    publication Vital Speeches gained me an invitation to spend an hour with the
                    Assistant Secretary but earned me only demerits from my supervisor.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>A report to another NEA Assistant Secretary (after returning from a trip to Iran)
                    about the activities of SAVAK (Iranian Intelligence) which was battling with the
                    Iranian Department of Labor for control over trade union activities was met with
                    instructions to my boss that he did not want such reporting, that after all “I
                    helped establish SAVAK.” Later I was to discover that on a subsequent field trip
                    to the general area the Assistant Secretary in question had instructed all
                    missions to supervise all of my contacts. Fortunately, most of the missions
                    chose to ignore the instruction.</p>
                <p>One last comment and then we will move to another subject, the posting to India.
                    On two or three occasions the NEA Deputy Assistant Secretary told me of an
                    upcoming meeting with Agency people to discuss labor issues. He apologized
                    sincerely and said he would like to have me present, but the Agency had a rule
                    never to meet when a Labor Advisor was present because they might reveal names
                    of certain U.S. trade union leaders with whom they had dealings. On one occasion
                    I laughed and told him that, if he wished, I could return in a few moments with
                    the names of at least 20 trade union leaders or employees in the Washington area
                    with whom the Agency had regular contact. He looked chagrined and that was the
                    end of that. I have often wondered whether on not Labor Advisors from other
                    Bureaus were subject to the same restrictions.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: When did you go to India?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: I went to India in the fall of 1962. But you probably don't know that I
                    had been slated to go to Brussels after Brookings. That bubble burst about three
                    weeks later when Assistant Secretary George Weaver from ILAB at the Department
                    of Labor told me that "16th Street” (AFL-CIO) had blocked the Belgium
                    assignment. I was not surprised- understanding the political winds at play in
                    this situation-but I was disappointed.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: This was after your tour at Brookings?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Yes, after Brookings. [Before leaving Washington] there was a two or
                    three month period when I was doing a few things in the Department. I got to
                    India in October of 1962 and stayed until late April or early May of 1965. India
                    was not really my cup of tea. On the other hand, I am sure glad that I worked in
                    a country such as India or one like it, so I could really get an understanding
                    of the dynamics of the situation. It was fascinating.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: How would you characterize India at that point in history?</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>MILLEN: Well, in a way, it was sad. The political structure was under great
                    stress, partly as a result of the fact that Nehru was coming to the end of his
                    life and had obviously lost a lot of his vigor and a lot of his capacity to
                    control events in India, to the extent that anybody can. He had lost a good deal
                    of that, and I had the impression that the corruption level was rising. While
                    corruption is endemic in all developing countries, I had the feeling that it was
                    on the rise, and part of it was [due to] Nehru's increasing age. He was a
                    remarkable person to watch. [When you looked into his eyes, you almost felt that
                    you were looking into a person's soul. And the day he was buried, everything ,of
                    course, closed down except for the events surrounding the funeral, and it was
                    not inappropriate that earthquake tremors went through Delhi on that day. It was
                    almost in keeping with the event. Something cataclysmic had happened, at least
                    in the life of India, that this man, who was a brave and highly intelligent man,
                    and, I think, for the most part a good man, [had died].</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Was there any institutionalized corruption in the Congress Party?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Oh, yes. The Congress Party was just kind of a place for boodle and
                    payoffs, but it is hard to separate out that which is endemic to countries with
                    this level of poverty and this level of diversity and challenge. The first time
                    I went to India, I was on a study trip for the Department of State. I came back
                    and I opened [my trip report] with the sentence, “In the functioning anarchy
                    called India. . . “ And it wasn't until two or three days before I left [India],
                    as I was going through the files, that I found Ambassador Bunker's commentary on
                    my report. He fairly well accepted most of what was in the report, but he said,
                    “I have trouble coming to grips with Millen's opening statement on functioning
                    anarchy.”</p>
                <p>Shea: It is like what somebody said about the Austrian-Hungarian Empire prior to
                    the First World War. It has a policy of calculated negligence.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Was Ambassador Bowles there?</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>MILLEN: Ambassador Galbraith was there when I arrived. He gave speeches and was a
                    public figure, but he didn't pay much attention to the running of the embassy.
                    He wrote some very fine essays in the form of cables that were very interesting
                    and deserved to be published, but he was a “stand apart” guy [with] that big
                    ego; nothing mattered [to him] but what he was doing. Once in a while you would
                    feel that he missed the lecture class, so he would call a staff meeting, and
                    after a couple of administrative comments had been made, one of them always
                    being that there had been so many security violations in the last month,
                    Galbraith would pick up the burden and give us these sometimes rather
                    interesting little essays or commentaries. His writing style was fluid and so
                    forth. I got the impression that he must work on his writing very hard, because
                    when he spoke he would use a word, then pull it back and insert another word,
                    and sometimes [do this] even a second or third time. He was very careful with
                    each word, and he seemed [to be] almost listening [to himself]. When I would
                    pick up something that he had written, [I thought] “God, he must spend an awful
                    lot of time editing.” His speaking style was just so different from his writing
                    style. Not that the words didn't come out fine, but he searched for the
                    appropriate words. It was an interesting experience. Of course, we were kind of
                    amused when the Chinese attacked India in early 1963; he obviously had so much
                    fun marshaling military support and going out to meet the planes that our
                    military sent over. He also got a great deal of pleasure out of bare-knuckling
                    Krishna Menon. He set it up with Nehru where he didn't have to do business with
                    Krishna Menon during that period.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Krishna Menon was the Foreign Minister during that period?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: No. Defense Minister. When Galbraith left, everybody [in the Embassy] was
                    looking forward to a change, because morale was not exactly high, and everybody
                    was saying that it's got to be better [under the new ambassador]. Of course,
                    Bowles came in and nothing much changed.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: How would you characterize the labor movement at that time, INTUC, and
                    the Communist Party movement and H.M.S.?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Obviously the Communist Party's labor movement, the All India Trade Union
                    Confederation or AITUC, was a superior group and much better organized. I used
                    to make rough comparisons with the Italian situation. You had the Communist
                    movement, the Congress Party federation INTUC (The Indian National Trade Union
                    Congress), the feisty H.M.S., which was a mildly socialist movement, and the
                    revolutionary socialists plus a plethora of independent unions. Once I put
                    Victor Reuther up to posing a question to the head of the revolutionary
                    socialist trade union movement, who was a very interesting personality. In
                    India, you could cross all these lines. So Victor, who was traveling through the
                    country, asked — I can't recall the name. — the leader of the revolutionary
                    socialist union what was so different between H.M.S. and his union that would
                    make it impossible for them to merge. He was very polite to Victor and said,
                    “Well, look, I need these guys from the Communists. Do you think I would be a
                    member of the state parliament, if I worked with H.M.S? You're crazy. I can't do
                    business with H.M.S.”</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>Kienzle: Rampant opportunism.</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Not from his point of view. Jatin Chakravarti-that was his name. I
                    remember it now-was effective in trade union affairs because of his political
                    position; he knew it; and I wanted Victor to understand it .</p>
                <p>Oh, God. I got into a little bit of trouble over two people I sent on leader
                    grants [even though] I didn't have much influence over the leader grants. Dave
                    Burgess, one of my predecessors, had negotiated an agreement with the Ministry
                    of Labor, which put almost the entire authority [for the selection of grantees]
                    in the hands of the unions. And we were getting some real bad ones! So I went to
                    the Ministry of Labor and I complained. I said, “I know that you don't
                    personally pick these people, but I wish you could convey to the unions that
                    they have got to pay more attention to the quality of people that they are
                    sending.” Then I went to each of the unions and I made my little spiel. One of
                    them said, “What the hell! We don't know what else to do with this guy. He's
                    worked hard.” I said, “Well, that's fine from your point of view, but you have
                    to look at the quality factors. You just can't send dummies.” In the meantime,
                    we sent one fellow from Kerala, who was a Christian, a big dark fellow, who when
                    he left for the United States was in the middle of a word war that involved some
                    anti-American sentiments. The politics of Kerala are particularly volatile. It
                    is a heavily Communist area and comparatively speaking a highly educated group.
                    So he went, and the Consul General in Madras didn't complain to me, but he
                    complained to Bowles about this kind of a guy going. Then earlier this
                    revolutionary socialist fellow Chakravarti went. He was one of my favorite
                    people. He had been nominated [earlier] and I came along during the processing
                    [of his grant]. There were objections to his going, and I said in a somewhat
                    flip way, “Well, Christ, he has been to Moscow, Prague, London, and China. Why
                    don't we continue his education?” So he went.</p>
                <p>Well, both those cases [worked out successfully]. The fellow from Kerala came in
                    after his trip pleased as punch. He would like to go back again and take his
                    wife. He said, “Before I went I thought that American women were loose [and had]
                    poor morals, and that you had an immoral society. I talked to a lot of parents
                    and I talked to some grandparents, and I realized that you are just different.
                    It's not loose morals. It's a different structure than we have.” I thought that
                    was quite an accomplishment for six weeks in the United States. And the
                    revolutionary socialist came into my office not long after he returned and said,
                    “Hey! I turned down an opportunity to demonstrate in front of your consulate in
                    Calcutta a few weeks ago.” I said, “Well, what about that!” He said, “You know
                    that trip to the United States? [That visit] proved that all of the things that
                    I have been accusing America of in the last ten years are wrong. Unfortunately,
                    I wrote this to a friend of mine and he's got the letter and he's threatening to
                    release it.” So I thought that [his change in outlook] was quite an
                    [accomplishment]. I told him, “Look, the price of admission to the United States
                    is not that you never demonstrate in front of our consulate again.” He said,
                    “No, I understand that. But I just didn't feel like it.” He used to like to come
                    up to my room. He would never drink in public, but he would come up to my room
                    and he liked scotch in moderation.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>Kienzle: How influential were the union leaders in the political process?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: The process was so muddy and so gigantic it was hard to tell. But when
                    one measures pay scales and the decisions coming out of the Wage Board
                    structure, one must say that they did rather well. When George Fernandez shut
                    down the city of Bombay under a process called a “bund” or general strike two
                    years in a row, reluctantly followed by the Communists, the unions got changes
                    in the state cost-of-living index. The unions had great influence in the banking
                    system and on the docks. They could often pose a threat to public order at time
                    which gave them intermittent power, but not in the daily running of
                    government.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Excuse me, could you define “bund”?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: It is like the German word Bund, but it is an active word. It is not a
                    noun. It's an action. It's a general strike. Well, Bombay unions following
                    Fernandez lead that twice. Once, for example, one of their main complaints was
                    that the so-called cost of living index as reflected by their state government
                    figures was inaccurate and that the workers were getting cheated. Well, as a
                    result of this particular direct action, the government set up a committee and
                    they concluded that the index was inaccurate; in fact the government admitted
                    that certain items put in that budget in 1936 had never been changed and the
                    products were no longer on the market.</p>
                <p>The [Indians] set up of wage boards, which are an anathema to us. To me they made
                    very good sense. The only way you could ever get some kind of a wage structure
                    was to have a reasonably impartial group study the whole history and more or
                    less lay out the benefits to be paid. Over a period of time the textile industry
                    [developed] a pretty decent wage structure, which could never have been attained
                    through direct collective bargaining. Not those levels. They also had, I think,
                    a wage board for the iron industry. These wage boards were very influential
                    economically, and they came about primarily through trade union actions, for the
                    most part [through] politics. Here again what's politics and what's trade
                    unionism? It's hard to separate them. I think the trade unions had an influence
                    but not on the order of what we would see in a European structure, where you
                    could trace where the trade unions said this and the government said this and
                    you can watch the process go on. Everything [in India] was too oblique and all
                    the lines were dotted and so forth, so it was very difficult to apply any
                    standards of measurement. But yes, the trade unions did have influence, a
                    considerable amount of influence. For example, in the United States, during my
                    days working with CIO, we could never organize the EXXON workers. In Bombay
                    EXXON refineries were organized. Now they weren't organized in the tight compact
                    form that we would have it, but by God, they had influence in that plant.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>Once I found an American pharmaceutical manufacture, I think it was Pfizer,
                    which, when I talked to the manager about the fact that the unions in the
                    industry were communist dominated, said yes, he knew that and they were worried
                    about it. And I got him to pretty well agree that if I could get [a
                    non-Communist] union-I was thinking about using H.M.S., because it had a fair
                    amount of strength in that industry-and if we could get a couple of breaks from
                    the employers' side, H.M.S. might be able to break the lock that the Communists
                    had. And this guy said, “I would be willing to take some strikes on it.” This
                    was totally foreign to most American employers, because they won't take a strike
                    for an ideological reason. Unfortunately I couldn't put the H.M.S. thing
                    together, so it never did work out.</p>
                <p>Unions did have considerable strength in the banking industry.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: What about the influence of INTUC given its special relationship with
                    the Congress Party?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Well, INTUC was represented, [for example] over in the Bombay textile
                    industry, and of course in its home location in Ahmedabad in Gandhi's union.
                    That was a local which Gandhi personally organized. Now these organizations had
                    considerable influence, but it was hard to measure the impact and hard to trace
                    the connecting points.</p>
                <p>Shea: What about unions organized along religious lines?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: That was beginning to develop strongly when I left. The Janata Party and
                    the Hindu revival groups were just forming into influential political elements.
                    They may have been organized at the plant level long before, but you first began
                    to see evidence of them or hear discussions them about the time I left in
                    1965.</p>
                <p>Shea: Do you recall a trade union leader by the name of George Fernandez?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: George was famous, and George was fun.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Could you identify George Fernandez?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: He was a Goan by origin and started out to be a seminary student. I am
                    not quite sure how he made the connection with trade unionism, but he did in the
                    Bombay area. He ended up having a large proportion of the taxi cab drivers and a
                    lot of others [in his union]. His was an independent union. He was building
                    strength. He was putting fight into the government. During the Chinese invasion
                    period, the government put him in jail for about three months, because it said
                    he had connections with the Chinese Communists. When I told the Consul General I
                    would like to see George in jail, the Consul General damn near shit.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Who was the Consul General?</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>MILLEN: I forget. Once Phil Bradley from USIS and I set up a one day conference.
                    We didn't have any money. We couldn't even offer lunch or anything. We did get
                    hotel space for the meeting. I invited industrialists, academic people, the
                    trade unions, and so forth. In the morning we talked about collective bargaining
                    and tariffs, in the afternoon about politics. No records were kept. It was just
                    absolutely fascinating. That was the kind of activities that were fun to do in
                    this job. The problem was that I never wrote up my notes and sent them in to
                    boast about what we did. It was just like opening the flood gates. Everybody had
                    something to offer. Ideas were brought up and knocked down, but there was no
                    rancor to speak of between employers and unions.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: I think the Indians like a rigorous discussion.</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Well, they do. They are great talkers.</p>
                <p>Shea: George Fernandez was from Ga.</p>
                <p>MILLEN: He was very important in throwing up these twenty-four hour stoppages
                    everywhere, which were organized and had an impact. He once had a meeting, which
                    I attended together with my British counterpart. We got there early, and, of
                    course, the honored guests were invited to sit on the platform, but [in India
                    the organizers] frequently do not have any chairs, and you are put on cushions.
                    The floor is padded and you have cushions behind your back. For someone not
                    accustomed to spending a couple hours [like that] it's pretty hard. Generally
                    one way you told the difference between an H.M.S. meeting and an INTUC meeting
                    was that at an H.M.S. meeting most of the participants came with a Western shirt
                    and pants on. [At an INTUC meeting] many of the Indians came in a dhotis; there
                    were no chairs; and they squatted. They are trained to do that and could spend
                    hours in that position. This was kind of a fundamental [difference] in the
                    behavior patterns of the two groups.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>So George invited me to a meeting. I don't remember what the event was. One of
                    the H.M.S. people gave a speech. He was a good guy. I basically liked him, but
                    his speech had an attack against Americans, because we weren't solidly enough
                    behind India in a little war that was taking place up north along the Pakistani
                    boarder. So he used that as a takeoff point to attack the Americans. We were
                    being pro-Pakistani, etc. I read his written speech, which was three or four
                    pages long. When my British friend Gordon came up-I have forgotten his last
                    name-I said, “We're not sitting up here. Let's sit in the audience.” He didn't
                    know why I said that. I said, “I'll tell you why when we go downstairs.” Of
                    course they weren't attacking Great Britain, I just took it upon myself. I said,
                    “I don't mind sitting here. I don't care if he wants to attack us, but I am not
                    going to sit on that God-damned platform as if I am agreeing with him. If I sit
                    up there, I'll ask permission to speak.” So we went down and sat in the
                    audience. Later I had a cup of coffee with George. He said, “Bruce, I have never
                    seen you angry before.” I said, “I wasn't really angry. I just didn't feel I
                    wanted to sit on a platform while you guys were attacking us. After all, there
                    are about eight shiploads of American grain out in your harbor right now, and
                    there was no mention made of that. George said, “Yes, I noticed you weren't
                    smiling today.”</p>
                <p>Shea: What about the coal miners in India. I always had the impression that they
                    were highly organized.</p>
                <p>MILLEN: They are pretty well organized. I once went to one of their national
                    conventions, which was held outside under tents and so forth. It was so hot that
                    they delayed the opening until after 5:30 at night. For Indians to call [a
                    delay] it has to be really hot. This was an INTUC meeting and there were about
                    2,000 delegates.</p>
                <p>Shea: What about wages and hours and working conditions in the mining
                    industry?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Oh, I would hesitate to say. It's not easy to make a comparison in the
                    first place. They had their wage boards over the years.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Was there a problem with child labor?</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>MILLEN: Oh, there always has been. You just see it all over the place. You look
                    around the construction sites and there were kids. Maybe they were not even
                    getting paid, but they were helping their mothers. Women do a lot of the
                    burdensome work on the construction sites there. One of the most impressive
                    things that I ever saw was [when] I was with Victor Reuther on his tour there.
                    We were down in Hyderabad, which is south. We took a trip about 40 miles by jeep
                    to where they were putting in the tallest and widest mortar dam in the world.
                    They would start with these great big rocks that looked like granite. Everybody
                    in the area was breaking these rocks up into little [pieces] for road beds and
                    so forth. People were all over the place: men, women, and little children just
                    chipping away. That was a major source of employment. There must have been
                    30,000 people just working on rock chipping. They were up to the 200 or 300 foot
                    level when we were there. They were walking on bamboo ramps which go up and
                    down, and men were carrying rocks which must have weighed 300 or 400 pounds
                    hanging from bamboo sticks carried on the shoulders of four to six people. The
                    women carried mud and cement. (End of Side A, Tape Two) There wasn't a machine
                    in use for the first 250 feet. Then they had cranes up at the 250 foot level.
                    Everything came up by hand. It was most impressive. It just staggered me.</p>
                <p>Shea: Almost like building a pyramid.</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Yes, on that order. I remember we used to get pictures during the Second
                    World War of building airfields in China, and you saw those flanks of people out
                    there. Well, this was the same kind of a picture, except they were going up the
                    side of what was damned near a mountain. Now they did not have authority to put
                    sluices in to make that a power plant. This was to be for irrigation and flood
                    control. But they were putting the sluices in anyway on the assumption that in
                    short order somebody would say, “By God, why aren't we developing power here?”
                    So that gave them a little bit of a head start on that project. India was a
                    fascinating place, but one of the things that made [my tour there] unpleasant
                    was the atmosphere in the Embassy. For reasons I am not quite sure of, I ran
                    into troubles there almost from the day I landed. And, of course, I wasn't a
                    perfect citizen. I sometimes reacted. I never did see a so-called efficiency
                    report from there, except that I did get a special letter saying that the
                    problems with me even extended into the distaff side of the house, because I had
                    not praised my assistant's wife sufficiently. That was the only solid comment
                    that I ever saw about my days in India.</p>
                <p>Shea: What about Ambassador Bowles in all this?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Well, Bowles was a charmer! But he had never left the New Deal behind
                    him. I can see how he would be a terrific advertising executive. He had a real
                    flair.</p>
                <p>Shea: I got to know him quite well, because he was not only the Governor of
                    Connecticut but he was also the Congressman from my home area. He was a charmer
                    all right.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>MILLEN: He was a real charmer. But I heard him once ball out three consuls
                    general for reporting honestly. He was just furious with them. They were giving
                    very good reports but you had to report according to Bowles, if you wanted to
                    get along with him. He was beyond his prime. He had Parkinson's disease. He died
                    just recently, but he lived a long time and [I don't know] how he kept up the
                    active life he did. He was a hard working guy. I have been at his place when we
                    had small groups and he would almost push people out of the door, because as he
                    said, “I am so tired I have to go to bed.”</p>
                <p>His main problem was that he so loved the Indians that he just didn't want to
                    ever say anything bad about them. I was present one night and he was saying how
                    soft the Americans were to send our kids to special schools. His kids would go
                    to the Indian schools. Of course, I knew the school that they would go to. They
                    would go to the Modern School for high level civil servants. He went on about
                    the superiority of these Indian schools and how soft we were, and my former
                    wife, not noted for diplomatic skills, said, “Mr. Ambassador, I couldn't agree
                    with you less.” [Laughter]</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Did the Ambassador laugh too?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: No, he didn't laugh. But what he probably did not recognize was the
                    snobbishness of a large part of the Indian school system for the elites, nor the
                    fact that any seat taken up by one of us reduced the total for Indians.
                    Furthermore, Indian schools followed the British model. .</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Well, shall we stop here and resume at some later time?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Yes. I think so. (End of Part I of the Interview)</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Today is November 22, 1993, and Jim Shea and I resuming our interview
                    with Bruce Millen. Bruce, do you want to begin by giving the statement that you
                    have prepared?</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>MILLEN: This isn't really a prepared statement, but I would like to go back and
                    add to the comments which I made previously about Italy. First of all, I just
                    want to say that given the circumstances, [Tom Lane], the Labor Attach� in Rome,
                    had great influence. He had influence in the Italian Government and with his
                    particular section of trade union activity, but he was considered to be a
                    powerful man in the country, and he was a powerful person in the Embassy. As far
                    as I could see, his power went unquestioned until near the end of my stay there.
                    As the Assistant Labor Attach�, I, on the other hand, had to carve out my own
                    little world, which was mainly in the economic affairs operations of both the
                    Embassy and the Mutual Security Agency, and I found warm acceptance there. The
                    leadership of both the aid mission and the Embassy economic officers were most
                    helpful and supportive, and they used me frequently. People like Vince Barnett,
                    who when I first went there headed the economic aid operation, was one of the
                    most brilliant and effective leaders I've ever served under. His deputy Leland
                    Barrow was almost in the same category. And Howard Cotton, who was Agricultural
                    Attach�, was most supportive. They all understood what was going on on the
                    political side, so they tried to help me and they tried to be supportive of me,
                    and they made life livable for me. And despite all the problems that I had, I
                    was a person of some substance on this.</p>
                <p>Now, the bizarre circumstances that I discussed earlier were there and were
                    palpable. There wasn't a day that went by when there wasn't some manifestation
                    of this attempt to keep a cover on covert operations or to keep the truth from
                    me or from the reporting system and so forth, but I did improve the reporting
                    out of the Embassy. I self-censored myself, and there were only two or three
                    occasions when I [experienced] interference with my reporting. That was partly
                    because I had a pretty good sense of what I could get through and what I
                    couldn't. So many of the labor attach�s worry about whether they are effective.
                    I was very effective on the economic side of the operation, and I enjoyed
                    myself.</p>
                <p>Just to show how bizarre this thing was, a friend of mine, who was a Fulbright
                    Scholar, was seen with Colonel Lane down in Naples at a meeting. The colonel
                    left, and a fellow came up [to my friend] and said, “Tell the colonel to give me
                    50,000 a month more.” thinking that he was associated with Lane. “The cost of
                    living is going up. I need 50,000 a month more.” So that is the kind of thing we
                    ran into.</p>
                <p>The real danger of what was taking place in Rome had to do with feeding a myth
                    which we came to believe. We then distorted political reporting.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: The myth being?</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>MILLEN: The myth being that when we were discussing the CISL we were dealing with
                    a non-confessional, apolitical trade union movement. Nobody else in Italy
                    believed that. Only Americans believed that. This showed up in our reporting,
                    and it was a disastrous position for an Embassy to find itself in. And the
                    [disaster] came to reality when De Gasperi and the Christian Democratic Party
                    lost considerable influence in the election of 1954.(?) That, I think, is the
                    lesson to be learned from this Italian experience and something that has
                    applicability throughout the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: In short, that our covert activities should not distort the objectivity
                    of our reporting?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: That's right. [Covert activities] distort. They make us analyze problems
                    incorrectly. Here there was such unanimity because you had not only Lane, the
                    Labor Attach�, but you had the AFL and the Embassy and the CIA all working in
                    the same direction and therefore nobody was looking at the situation very
                    honestly or with any sense of reality.</p>
                <p>So that's about all I have to say. I think it is an important ending to my
                    earlier statement.</p>
                <p>Shea: Just one question. You're saying that there was never any question about
                    the ties between the Christian Democratic Party and the CISL?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: No [question]. I know that we started out with the idea that we could
                    develop a labor force independent of the Christian Democratic Party, but we
                    never could, and I never saw any indication from any of the CISL leaders, high
                    or low, that they had any meaningful independence from the party. All we did was
                    save the party money for financing the union. We financed it instead. I had no
                    quarrel with the objectives of what they were trying to do, but a little
                    subtlety and a little willingness to put these people on their own would have
                    been a big improvement.</p>
                <p>Shea: Just one other question. Would you say the same thing about the socialists
                    and the UIL?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Well, I got UIL involved in a few small but legitimate programs through
                    the economic aid mission. I put together with the housing chief a housing bill
                    with low interest rates, and I brought CISL and UIL together. I left and I don't
                    know whatever happened to that piece of legislation, but we at least had them on
                    the surface working together. Occasionally I would get UIL people trips to the
                    United States, but this was all petty-ante stuff. I'm not saying that UIL was a
                    perfect instrument either. They had their means of financing, which by our
                    standards were highly irregular and so forth. So we are not dealing in absolutes
                    here. We are simply dealing with being honest to our own selves and our ability
                    to analyze accurately. I improved it by my presence because I eliminated some of
                    the brazen falsehoods that had been going out.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Did the AFL accept your activities with the UIL at all?</p>

                <p>MILLEN: Well, the AFL didn't like them, and certainly Irving [Brown] and Jay
                    [Lovestone] didn't. But the individual AFL leaders, who came over, were decent
                    for the most part. In fact one of the friendliest fellows that ever came down
                    the pike was Tom Murphy from the Bricklayers Union. The ICFTU had recognized the
                    UIL, so the AFL couldn't absolutely say you can't do any of these things, and
                    the things that I did were just small stuff. They helped the UIL a little bit
                    and gave it a little legitimacy, and I don't think they harmed the other
                    program. The idea was not to bring these organizations into greater conflict. It
                    was just to “live and let live.” They both had something to offer to our joint
                    effort against the Communists.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Is there anything else that you would like to add on your assignments in
                    either Oslo or New Delhi?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Well, I can't quite recall what I said about India. I may have said this.
                    India was an interesting experience. I'm glad I was there. It was hard. I was
                    not accepted not by the Embassy, but I was accepted by the Indians. I had good
                    rapport with many academicians, many British, American and Indian business
                    people, and a good share of the trade union movement. I felt like I made a
                    contribution there, but I had an internal conflict in the Embassy which made
                    life hard for me. I got to the point where I was watching my back a good deal of
                    the time, and that was unfortunate. Looking back, I am not in the mood to
                    discuss who struck whom first. Personally, I did feel I did a great deal of
                    creative work in cooperation with AID, but it all ended on this note as
                    expressed by one colleague, “We are afraid to be seen talking to you.”</p>
                <p>Kienzle: I think we left off last time at the end of your tour in India. Do you
                    want to talk about your subsequent assignment in Turkey?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Yes. I went to Turkey and I was initially assigned as Executive Assistant
                    to the Secretary General of CENTO . Given the kind of unfortunate circumstance I
                    had in India, that [assignment] was to get me back in the shadows where I could
                    hide for a while.</p>
                <p>Shea: Could you specify what CENTO was?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: The Central Treaty Organization, which was the successor organization to
                    the Baghdad Pact, which was the northern tier. CENTO didn't have much
                    substantive value. It may have had a little public relations value with the
                    Turks and the Iranians and the Pakistanis.</p>
                <p>That was a strange year. During the summer months the organization had [a work
                    schedule] of 27 and a half hours a week and we didn't know what to do with 27
                    hours of it. So when the [Department] created a spot in the Embassy for a Labor
                    Attach� , and I had recommended this myself about seven or eight years earlier,
                    there was a little bit of a “to do” about it. An objection was raised to my
                    being made the Labor Attach�, which, I guess, came out of the AFL-CIO. I never
                    heard much about it. I guess the Department [of State] must have just beaten
                    back the challenge on budgetary impact alone.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>That was an interesting assignment. Turkey was one of the few where you had the
                    genesis of American-style unionism abroad. The AFL had spent a lot of time there
                    in the early 1950s, and there was almost a business-type unionism.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Who was your predecessor?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Well, there was none. I was the first Labor Attach� there. Turkey came
                    closer to business-style unionism than any place I have ever seen in the world.
                    And it was effective. Turkey had a Republican Party which was moderately left of
                    center. The party names have all changed in Turkey, but in the 1960s the Demirel
                    Party was the dominant force, and it showed. Its political alliances were not
                    hidden or anything like that. The two forces got along pretty well inside the
                    trade union movement, and while I was there, we paid all their bills through the
                    AID Mission. We even built their [union headquarters], which was one of the
                    better pieces of architecture in Ankara. Everything was pretty much out in the
                    open. True ideological political unionism did not really start until roughly
                    1967. Subsequently the entire picture has changed and I have not been able to
                    follow events.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: This was Turk-is?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Turk-is was the major federation and it functioned pretty well, but as I
                    said, we financed almost all of its activities. This was well known. There was
                    nothing covert about it. The only criticism I would have made of that operation
                    was that we weren't preparing them for the day when we would cut them loose, and
                    they weren't making any effort to be cut loose either. I'm afraid that I
                    frightened Einer Edwards and his crew over on the AID side of [the Embassy],
                    because I got started looking around at the funding of [the trade union
                    movement] and they thought I was there to wipe [the funding] out. I wasn't. I
                    simply thought that we must make preparations sooner or later, hopefully sooner,
                    to let the [Turks] become self-financing. As the head of the Restaurant
                    Employees and Waiters Union told me, “We haven't paid our dues. We usually wait
                    until right before the convention and then we pay our per capita, so we can get
                    our delegates, but we see no need to pay in as long as you are there.”
                    [Laughter]</p>
                <p>Kienzle: How many members were there in the trade union movement?</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>MILLEN: Oh, I can't recall, but it was a strong movement, and they had a piece of
                    [labor] legislation you would not believe. They didn't have an election but a
                    union got bargaining rights by sort of a finger in the wind and a sense of the
                    effort, and they were recognized. When this happened, everybody in that plant
                    except the plant manager was a member of the union. The first contract was
                    always taken up with the plant executives being bargained out of representation
                    in the union, and of course all sorts of little goodies came up like increases
                    in pay or [as for an example] in one factory they had to provide soap or soap
                    powder and so forth, which was expensive in Turkey. If you weren't a member of
                    the union, you paid 1.25 times the union dues. In other words you increased the
                    union dues for the guys who paid an “agency fee.” Now I am not sure whether that
                    legislation has all gone down the drain, but it was fascinating that in Turkey,
                    which was regarded as a third world country, they had these concepts. In fact
                    one Ministry of Labor official told me one time, “We're thinking of increasing
                    that [agency fee] to 1.50.</p>
                <p>Shea: And there were no direct ties at all with the political parties?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: There were no common institutions through which they [interacted]. No,
                    they were just aligned and they used their influence for one party or another.
                    There were no institutional arrangements as there are in Scandinavia and so
                    forth, where the roles are laid out. It's just that some of your influence [as a
                    union leader] comes from being part of the government party and [the government]
                    throws favors to you which increases your influence with the workers or in the
                    organization or whatever the case might be. While I was there, there was no real
                    conflict between the two major political wings [of the trade union movement].
                    And then you had a truly radical labor organization-DISC. Whether it was
                    Communist or not I'm not quite sure. I am sure parts of it were. DISC was led by
                    Turkler and the Metal Workers Federation in it, and Turkler's union came as
                    close to being like the U.A.W. as any union in the underdeveloped world. That
                    was a operation the likes of which are hard to find. You would go into their
                    office and you would see that the printing press was always going, and they all
                    had classes; they had indoctrination; they had everything going all the time in
                    that union. I am trying to think what that union was called, but it was the star
                    performer of that left wing group. The metal workers were the core of it.
                    Turkler was later assassinated. I admired Turkler. I never sat down and talked
                    philosophy with him or what his true political thoughts were or anything, but he
                    certainly was far to the left of anything that Turk-is ever developed.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Did Turkey have a cooperative movement to go with the labor movement,
                    say as you would find in Scandinavia?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: I can't recall. And then there was another wonderful guy who was a
                    leader, the chief editor of the Republican Party newspaper in Istanbul, Ipekci.
                    He was one of the few people in Turkey with whom I felt comfortable sitting
                    [down] on a veranda and talking. You know, in calm terms. I wasn't up in arms
                    about Vietnam, but I certainly had a lot of questions about it. He was one I
                    could trust when talking [confidentially]. He was later assassinated too.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>Kienzle: Were the Turks really interested in the Vietnam issue at that time or
                    was that something that we were trying to push?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: It wasn't a big issue with them, not the way it was in India. And, of
                    course, you had that strong military cult in Istanbul, which gave almost
                    automatic support to anything called “Anti-Communism.” I don't remember seeing
                    much in the press, and you certainly didn't see it expressed in trade union
                    affairs.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Would you describe the collective bargaining that went on as free and
                    unfettered?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Well, it was aggressive. There were strikes. Every once in a while a
                    party figure would step in to increase the leverage of one side or the other,
                    because Demirel's party was of course basically a conservative party. So there
                    were these conservative pressures on the trade union movement not to go too far,
                    but it was a rough and ready kind of a situation. You might think of the Western
                    frontier in America, which in many respects it [resembled].</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Were the trade unions basically independent of government and free to
                    bargain collectively?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: It is hard to say. It was more like ward heeling politics on a local,
                    regional, and national scale. Non-structured give and take, rewards and
                    punishment.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: I believe that in the late 1970s and early 1980s there was a problem,
                    and the ICFTU looked pretty carefully at the relationship between the government
                    and Turk-is.</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Well, in the late 1960s nobody walked in lock step. This isn't to say
                    that they didn't get a message from this minister or that minister saying knock
                    it off and so forth, but it wasn't that obvious and I thought Turk-is was very
                    aggressive given the framework within which it existed.</p>
                <p>I enjoyed myself there but one of the reasons I had the feeling I wanted to get
                    out of the Foreign Service was that I had so much difficulty with the Turkish
                    language. I had too much time when I was in CENTO. I took double language
                    lessons, but I really didn't make much progress at all.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Well, Turkish is not one of the easier languages to learn.</p>
                <p>MILLEN: I know, but I was 45 or so, and it just didn't work out right. I was also
                    going through a divorce and I had just been ranked in the bottom five percent of
                    my class from India. I was looking for a new job. I had a rough time.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>Shea: How long were you there, Bruce?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: In Turkey just two years. Almost exactly one year in CENTO and one year
                    as Labor Attach�.</p>
                <p>Shea: Who was your Ambassador?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: First, it was Ray Hare, and then later Pete Hart. He came from a small
                    town banking family. He was kind of a nice guy.</p>
                <p>Shea: How were the employers? Were they neanderthals?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Not all of them. There was a progressive [element]. For example, there
                    was one group that I used to meet occasionally. I made the initial contact
                    through the man who ran the biggest glass factory, which produced fine glasses
                    and art work and so forth. There were some progressive people there but they
                    didn't know much about unionism. I remember the first time that I went there as
                    a visitor. I had lunch with them and I spent maybe three and a half hours in the
                    restaurant just “bullshitting” so to speak. They enjoyed it, but it was hard
                    working through an interpreter. That's what got me down in Turkey. [At the same
                    time Turkey had] some of the most interesting sight-seeing and so forth. That
                    whole Mediterranean area there is just gorgeous! I had only one chance to go out
                    to the east, and I was sick and I couldn't go.</p>
                <p>Shea: Isn't it Izmir where they have the old Roman ruins?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Yes, they had Efes near Hadrian's wall out there, half way between Adana
                    and Izmir.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: After Turkey you joined the Department of Labor?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Yes, then I went with the Department of Labor.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Do you want to describe the transition and how you got your job
                    there?</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>MILLEN: Well, of course I had been recruited originally through the Department of
                    Labor and worked with their people in various capacities at the International
                    Labor Organization. I knew a lot of people in ILAB, guys like Leo Wertz, who was
                    Assistant Secretary for Administration, and Phil Arnow, who at this time was
                    head of the Policy Evaluation Staff. So I had entree. It just took a bit of
                    time. On one occasion I paid my own way back and met with Under Secretary Jim
                    Reynolds. There were two jobs open. One I really didn't think I was qualified
                    for; that was in the equal opportunity field. That job went to Jim Jones, who
                    held it for about two years and then left to be on the faculty of the University
                    of Wisconsin Law School. He was a very bright fellow. The other job was in Labor
                    Relations Management Services, and Bea Burgoon eventually got the job. My entry
                    on the scene forced Reynolds to fill those two jobs that had been vacant for a
                    long time. I didn't get either one of them. I could see that putting Burgoon in
                    a high, super-grade job took care of the women's end, and she was a highly
                    competent woman. And putting Jim, who is black, into that other one satisfied
                    some other needs in the Department. So I had no complaint. I was just amused
                    that those jobs might have remained empty for a long time had I not come back
                    and seen Reynolds.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: What job did you finally get at the Department of Labor?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: I then went into what we just called the Office of Policy Planning . That
                    office gets a different name with every new president. When I left the
                    Department in 1981 it was the Assistant Secretary for Policy Evaluation and
                    Research (ASPER), but in essence it was the policy planning office. I headed a
                    small unit there on wages and labor relations. I was there for 13 years, from
                    1967 to 1981. The last year I got out of ASPER and I was the Special Assistant
                    to Dean Clowes, who took over the Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB).
                    I had known Dean [earlier]. Dean was out of the Steelworkers. I used to organize
                    with him and his father used to be my boss. Later I had been in Italy with him,
                    where he was part of the Productivity Division.</p>
                <p>Shea: Were you able to get back to Italy?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: I have only been back two or three times. I used to go back to Norway
                    fairly frequently, but now I haven't been back to Norway since 1978 and I
                    haven't been back to Italy since 1983.</p>
                <p>Shea: Back on Turkey, Bruce, it is always regarded as one of the most progressive
                    Moslem countries. Would you care to comment on the status of women there?</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>MILLEN: Well, first of all, the Turks were always easier to deal with on the
                    Israeli issue. They did not have an embassy when I went there, but they did have
                    a representative and they did a lot of business with Israel. Israeli contractors
                    worked there and so forth. They kept these low level relationships. So it was
                    not a rough situation, but they didn't want to irritate the Iranians and all the
                    other Arab countries. On a lot of other issues, they didn't want to irritate us,
                    so they frequently were at least understanding of what we wanted to do and went
                    along with us. When I was there you had the first signs of their being a little
                    resentful of our influence. Nothing rough, but we were conscious of the fact,
                    and I can understand that. My God! Around Ankara [we had a] number of our troops
                    and our hospital and our school and all that sort of stuff. Then in Izmir we had
                    a [large contingent] of navy as well as air force. It was inevitable that sooner
                    or later you were going to get some outcries, but basically I didn't think that
                    we were faced with a difficult situation there. I enjoyed those few Turks [I
                    knew but because of my short residence there and because my language limitations
                    I didn't get to know many of them very well.</p>
                <p>in Turkey I didn't have much trouble, except once I had a fight with the head of
                    Turk-is at a lunch given by the Ambassador. Afterwards the Ambassador called me
                    over to his office and told me he didn't like it. I said that I was trying to
                    make a point with [the head of Turk-is]. He wasn't going to push me around.
                    Well, there were no further outbreaks of hostility by the Ambassador, and he
                    never held that against me. Generally the Embassy let me go about my work and
                    accepted what I tried to do. I did only small scale things except for reporting
                    and trying to find out what the hell was going on. We had a very fine Deputy
                    Chief of Mission named Martin, who was very easy to work with and very
                    understanding of problems and I came to have some appreciation for him.</p>
                <p>Of course the way the Department of State evaluated people doing our type of work
                    is strange. I tried to get close enough to the radical trade union movement to
                    get information and maybe [conduct] a little bit of cross chat, which I could do
                    with Turkler. But attempts to do it [were sometimes problematic]. In Izmir I had
                    a long interview with a fellow, who was secretary or whatever, and he wrote an
                    article attacking me and the Americans. Well, I was, of course, a little ashamed
                    of that, or at least a little disappointed, that I hadn't been able to pull this
                    off quietly. The Deputy Chief of Mission put that in my efficiency report as
                    something that I should be commended for, [i.e.], that I had come under attack
                    by left-wingers. I didn't argue. . . (End of Side B, Tape II)</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Okay, we are back on the record.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>MILLEN: Well, the Labor Attach� Program has always had to fight for its
                    legitimacy, and from what I hear when we listen to [the current Special Advisor
                    to the Secretary of State and Coordinator International Labor Affairs] Tony
                    Freeman, it hasn't changed one whit, except that you have fewer people. I think
                    that's just part of the fact that the labor function just doesn't have a natural
                    niche in an institution like the Department of State. Now I found [the Labor
                    Attach� Program] much looser, less structured and more liberal-and I am not
                    saying that in a political sense necessarily-and easier to function in during
                    the 1950s than I did in the 1960s. The old [Foreign Service] structure was
                    asserting itself [in the 1960s]. All the new breath that came in with the Second
                    World War was probably crystallizing, so you were getting a more bureaucratic
                    style.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Would you attribute that to the fact that there were more political
                    appointees in the Labor Attach� Program early on in the 1950s, and that the
                    leadership became more career oriented later on?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: That may account for it. It used to always be fun — I don't know if you
                    ever noticed it — watching your British colleagues. There was more bizarre and
                    aberrant behavior amongst the British, because they all wore the proper ties.
                    They didn't have to kowtow to the ambassador or his upper group. They had gone
                    to the [same] schools. So you had, I thought, frequently a bunch of freer
                    spirits on the British side of the fence than you did on ours. I don't know if
                    that's a generalization that holds up or not, but that was my feeling from time
                    to time.</p>
                <p>During the most intense part of the Cold War period, I think we [in the Labor
                    Attach� Program] were tolerated to one extent or another, as, for example, in
                    Rome when everything was keyed to the anti-Communist image. You had greater
                    tolerance of our activities because we were expected in some way or another to
                    be at the forefront of the anti-Communist struggle. I think that just about the
                    time that Nixon and Kissinger got into d�tente the labor function fell apart
                    almost instantaneously. I don't know whether that was a coincidence or not, but
                    I had that feeling. Certainly we were moderately useful to some mission chiefs
                    during that period, but I am sure — and I think you're seeing it now — that if
                    there are budget cuts and any staff cutting at all, the labor attach�s will
                    frequently be the first on the list to go. I just think that this is in the
                    nature of the State Department, which has never found that perfect type of a
                    labor attach� to do a certain specific thing and never will.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Do you see a role for the labor attach� in working with the AFL-CIO
                    institutes in say democracy building?</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>MILLEN: Well, there always is a conflict. There are different viewpoints as to
                    what is required. A young lady in [the Bureau of] Intelligence and Research
                    commented to me not long ago, “Oh, the AFL-CIO is just making things dreadful
                    in. . . “ I think she was talking about things in Russia or Eastern Europe. She
                    said, “Their viewpoints are so wrong.” Well, I didn't want to get into a
                    discussion on it. First of all, I don't know what the AFL-CIO is doing in
                    Eastern Europe, so I was in no position to discuss much. But I think government
                    obviously has a different outlook than the trade unions have on what is to be
                    done. Once you get beyond the simple business of anti-Communism, when you get
                    into the business of building democracy, these disparate viewpoints make
                    themselves even more felt. Certainly that was my experience in Italy and other
                    places, where just being anti-Communist wasn't enough for [Irving] Brown [and
                    company]. You had to be super anti-Communist. So you have that kind of a
                    conflict between labor attach�s [and the AFL-CIO representatives] if they are
                    trying to work together, or dovetail their work. You can't work as a team with
                    them, because that would certainly undermine their entire position of
                    independence, and I think quite rightly so. There might be an identity of
                    interests in the long term, but how to get there is always going to be an area
                    of division, and I suppose that this is one reason that the AFL-CIO has paid
                    much less attention to the Labor Attach� Program in recent years. In 1980 we got
                    [then Secretary of State] Muskie to focus in on trying to stimulate [AFL-CIO]
                    interest in the Department and work more closely with George Meany's operation
                    or at least to attract their attention and support, but that, of course, fell
                    apart with the election [of 1980]. Whether anything would have [otherwise] come
                    of it or not, I don't know. Muskie wanted to do it, and the people at the Labor
                    Department were trying to put together some ideas on it, I know. But the fact of
                    the matter is that even after fifty years the labor function has never been
                    institutionalized, and I don't think you're going to do.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: I think that [S/IL] Tony Freeman has a group once again reexamining the
                    role of the labor attach� and where it fits in and trying to advise [on the
                    future of the Labor Attach� Program].</p>
                <p>Shea: But Bruce is absolutely right. Right now the Department has asked for a 14
                    percent cut in personnel. All the missions are coming in and the first job they
                    want to eliminate [is usually the labor attach� position]. That's what Tony and
                    Jack Muth told me a couple weeks ago. They are faced with this terrific
                    personnel cut due to the budget. Right away as soon as the missions get the
                    inquiry, the first one [cut is the labor attach�]. Then of course the word is
                    out that in [the State Department's personnel] program of up or out the labor
                    attach�s don't make it. I have addressed a few of these groups [in the labor
                    attach� training program at the Foreign Service Institute] and the young people
                    tell me that they want one or maybe two labor assignments and then want to go on
                    and be political officers.</p>
                <p>MILLEN: Well, you have the case of that very energetic man, Dan Turnquist. He
                    wanted to be a labor attach� in the worst way, but nobody would promote him. He
                    went for years without a promotion. And he thought maybe he would have to leave
                    the labor group, but finally I guess he did get a promotion.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>Shea: He's done very well.</p>
                <p>MILLEN: And Lennie Sandman went for years without a promotion. Of course he had
                    some sickness and so forth, which may have been a partial explanation. For my
                    part I fared unusually well as far as promotions and special assignments were
                    concerned, but obviously my string was running out.</p>
                <p>Shea: Well, I went for a good many years [without a promotion].</p>
                <p>Kienzle: Bruce, are there any other comments you would like to make before we
                    conclude?</p>
                <p>MILLEN: No, I don't think so.</p>
                <p>Kienzle: If not, I want to thank you on behalf of the Labor Diplomacy Oral
                    History Project for allowing us to do this interview, and Jim, thank you for
                    participating.</p>
                <p>Shea: Once again, it has been a pleasure, Don.</p>
