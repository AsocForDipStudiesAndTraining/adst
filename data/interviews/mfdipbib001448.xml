                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is April 29, 1996. This is an interview with John D.
                        Scanlon. This is being done on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic
                        Studies and Training and I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy. Can we start at the
                        beginning? When and where were you born? And tell me something about your
                        parents.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: I was born in a small town in northwestern Minnesota called Thief River
                    Falls, December 20, 1927. My mother was second generation Norwegian, 100%
                    Norwegian in origin. My father was a second generation born in the United States
                    Irish. So, I'm of Norwegian-Irish heritage. I grew up in Thief River Falls,
                    graduated in 1945. The war was still on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your father doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: He for most of the time was a salesman in a men's clothing store.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And was your mother a housewife?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: She had a year at the University of Minnesota, but they married very
                    young. I think they were both 20 or something like that. She interrupted her
                    college career to become a mother and a housewife. Her father was one of the
                    local bankers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to high school where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: In that town, at Lincoln High School. I graduated in early June 1945.
                    World War II was still on. I was 17 �, so I enlisted in the Navy and I was in
                    boot camp when the war ended.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For how long were you in the Navy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: During the war, you enlisted theoretically for the duration or 6 months.
                    All of us were out by mid or late '46. I was discharged after a little over 13
                    months service in August 1946.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: I stayed home for a year, worked various jobs in Thief River Falls. I
                    wasn't quite sure what I wanted to do in college. Then the following year, 1947,
                    I enrolled in the University of Minnesota.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: I took a BA. I dropped out for almost a year. I took a BA in '52 in
                    modern history and political science. I got very interested in Russian. In the
                    summer of '52 after I graduated, I took an intensive course in Russian, 10 weeks
                    of 20 hours a week. The University of Minnesota had one of the early 4 year
                    Russian programs. I found that I had a reasonably good ear for languages, so I
                    stayed on. Over the next 2 � years, I wound up with 4 years of Russian, a year
                    of French, a year of German, intensive courses all of them, a year of
                    Serbo-Croatian. I spent 2 summers abroad, one in Turkey and one in Yugoslavia. I
                    took an MA in Russian area studies in 1955.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What directed you towards history?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: I was always interested in history during my high school years. I read
                    prolifically World War II history, 20th century history. It just interested me,
                    European history mainly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Russian history?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: That started mainly in my college years, particularly right around my
                    junior year. I took various courseRussian history, Russian government, a very
                    lengthy survey of World War II history which got deeply involved with the
                    Russian campaign. A course in Russian geography and Russian culture. The
                    interest grew and grew and led me to try the language.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went abroad to Turkey first?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>SCANLAN: Yes. The University of Minnesota had a program called Student Project
                    for Amity Among Nations [SPAN], which was started in 1947. Every year they
                    selected 4 countries. It was not just the university. It was 12 other colleges
                    in the state of Minnesota. You were selected a year ahead of time. You prepared
                    with an advisor a topic of study. Plus the language if you didn't already have
                    the language. And then you would go for 3 months or so in the summer, live on
                    the economy, frequently with a family or in an institution, a school or
                    something, and work on a study project, come back the following year, write up
                    the project, and participate in administering the program for the next group of
                    students. It's a very good program. You got credits for this. I applied for a
                    group to Turkey and went to Turkey in the summer of '54. En route I spent almost
                    2 weeks in Yugoslavia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yugoslavia then was pretty much...SCANLAN: It was pretty
                        basic. They were still very poor. Tito was beginning to become a more
                        moderate dictator, but it was still a pretty tightly held country. I spent
                        about 10 days there on my way to Turkey and almost a week on my way back
                        because, frankly, I was more interested in Slavic societies than Turkey or
                        Muslim societies. When I got back, my Russian professor called me in and
                        asked me if I would be the faculty advisor for a group that they had
                        organized to go to Yugoslavia the following summer. They made me a half-time
                        instructor so that I would technically qualify as faculty. I studied
                        Serbo-Croatian with my group of 11 students and took them to Yugoslavia the
                        following summer. I took the Foreign Service exam in the embassy in Belgrade
                        in June 1955. In those days, it was given in June and you could arrange to
                        take it at any embassy if you were going to be overseas. So, I did. I took
                        it in Belgrade in June of '55.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I took mine the year before in Frankfurt. I was in the Air
                        Force at the time. My first post was Frankfurt.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: In my case, I went back eventually to be ambassador in the same building
                    where I had taken the exam in June of '55.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were in Yugoslavia, what did the group do? Could
                        you describe Yugoslavia at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: The first time I was there on my way to Turkey, I did not speak
                    Serbo-Croatian. My Russian was already reasonably fluent. I found that in those
                    days most Yugoslavs spoke Russian. It was an obligatory language in school. So I
                    was able to get by in Russian.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>The following year, I had 11 students. One was a graduate student. The rest were
                    undergrads. Several of them had learned Serbo-Croatian amazingly well in a 1
                    year course. Some of the others just barely got by. They scattered all over the
                    country. They all had individual projects. My mission was to help get them
                    established and to visit each 1 of them at least twice during the summer. I
                    think the most interesting case was an anthropologist, the graduate student, who
                    went to Prizren, spent the entire summer there studying the role of the
                    marketplace as a meeting place for the disparate ethnic groups in Prizren, which
                    were pretty disparate. They had Albanian Muslims, Albanian Catholics, Serbian
                    Orthodox, Macedonians, there was still a fairly significant Turkish population
                    there. There were quite a few gypsies who he categorized as belonging to 3
                    groups. There were gypsy Muslims, gypsy Catholics, and gypsy Orthodox. He did a
                    marvelous job of surveying all the neighborhoods. They tended to live in
                    distinct neighborhoods, but they came together in the marketplace. In his case,
                    I only went once. I spent a week with him there. Very, very poor, the whole
                    country poor. But nobody was starving. Everybody seemed to have a reasonably
                    good diet. Food was plentiful and inexpensive. Everybody was housed. You didn't
                    see beggars. There was a basic level of life available to everyone. On a couple
                    of occasions for minor illnesses I had to go to medical clinics. I went to one
                    in Prizren for a minor infection. Very well organized and staffed, small,
                    modest, but life wasn't bad. But they all were very much aware of the fact that
                    they were living in a police state. Tito had begun to moderate his dictatorship
                    then but it was still pretty tight. No cars. No private cars. They started the
                    summer of '55, they signed a contract with Fiat to start producing small Fiats.
                    But I think the statistics in '55 were something like 27,000 privately owned
                    automobiles in the entire country. I traveled all over the country, met a lot of
                    people. I never met anybody all summer long who owned an automobile. Most people
                    didn't have refrigerators or other household appliances. And there was a
                    tremendous community living arrangement, extended families, extended friendship
                    groups. People helped and supported one another. But they were still talking
                    about World War II, very much so. Tremendous feelings against one another,
                    particularly the Croatians and the Serbs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go into Croatia?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>SCANLAN: Yes, I did. My first stay in Zagreb, I stayed in a private home that was
                    arranged by a Croatian I had met in a camp where we lived in pup tents south of
                    Dubrovnik. I went down there with some students from Belgrade University and wet
                    met some Zagrebi university students. So, when I went to Zagreb, this student
                    arranged for me to stay in a friend's home, an apartment. One of the first
                    things I heard from the woman that I was staying with was criticism about my
                    language. Why would I learn such a peasant tongue like Serbian when Croatian was
                    such a much more sophisticated tongue? I said, “My professor at the University
                    of Minnesota was a Serb.” Right away, I heard this sort of demeaning tone
                    towards the Serbs. Earlier in Belgrade, I had heard these blood curdling tales
                    from the Serbs about all of the Croatian atrocities, the Ustasi atrocities
                    against the Serbs during World War II. I'm sure all of these things grow in the
                    telling. But again, it was a generational thing. The students didn't talk this
                    way. The students I was with from Belgrade University were very happy to be
                    friends with students from Zagreb University and vice versa. But the World War
                    II generation had become traumatized and were still directed against one another
                    so to speak.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel the hand of the police state at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: It was there lightly with regard for me personally... On a few
                    occasions, I recognized that they were keeping track of my whereabouts. It
                    depended upon where you were. For instance, when I went down to Kosovo, I took a
                    train and wound up in Pec in the middle of the night in a hotel. I had a feeling
                    that they knew who I was. But most of the time, no. In those days, frequently
                    you didn't get a hotel room. You got a bed in a hotel room and there would be a
                    stranger... Sometimes I wasn't quite sure who the stranger was. They never mixed
                    sexes in the hotel rooms. Once in a while, I would be told that there had been a
                    police inquiry after I had visited somebody. But that was sort of a light hand.
                    The police state was clearly there. People were still somewhat frightened,
                    particularly Serbs who had had a World War II record of being with
                    Mikhailovich's forces. I had met some of them.Q: These were the Chetniks.</p>
                <p>SCANLAN: Yes. After the war, many of them had been imprisoned or what have you.
                    They were very anti-communist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you getting about the feeling towards the Soviet
                        Union and towards the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>SCANLAN: Very open, warm, friendly towards the United States. The Soviet Union,
                    mixed. I suppose it depended upon the circles you were traveling in. I was
                    traveling in either student circles or in friendly family circles who did not
                    tend to be part of the new class. Djilas' book had come out right after that.
                    That was right at the time when Debi and Djilas were under attack by the
                    authorities. I didn't get much of a feeling... Once in a while, somebody would
                    speak very favorably about the Soviet Union and Soviet liberation, particularly
                    if you met somebody who either believed in communism or was playing an official
                    role. But I don't recall much discussion of the Soviet Union. Most people
                    greeted me warmly as an American. One time on a train, a young military officer
                    was rather hostile to me. But other than that...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You took the exam at the embassy. I guess this was the old
                        3 � day exam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: No. I think it was the first year of the 1 day exam. In '55, you had to
                    take the language exam, but it was the first year where you didn't have to pass
                    it. In my case, I did. I got a very high score in Russian, which probably helped
                    me in the oral exam because they saw that. Then within another year or 2, they
                    totally eliminated the foreign language exam. In '55, they still had it, but it
                    was 1 day, about 8 hours.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any contact with the people at the embassy at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>SCANLAN: My impression was that Ambassador Riddleburger was very highly regarded
                    by his own staff and by Yugoslavs in general. The people in the embassy that I
                    meI didn't spend that much time in the embass1 in particular, a young political
                    officer named Steve Palmer, was very helpful to me. We discussed the possibility
                    of a Foreign Service career. He had very good Serbo-Croatian. I was notified
                    towards the end of the summer that I had passed the written exam. In the
                    meantime, through some contacts at the university, I had been offered a Yugoslav
                    government scholarship to spend a year studying at Belgrade University, which
                    rather appealed to me. I went into the embassy and talked to Steve about this.
                    He gave me some very good advice. He said, “The question is, do you really want
                    a Foreign Service career?” I told him I thought I did. He said they had a freeze
                    on, they hadn't taken in very many officers for the past several years, and they
                    probably would take in a considerable number in the next 2 or 3 years to make up
                    the deficit. He said, “It's up to you if you really want a Foreign Service
                    career, it would probably be a good idea to go back and take the oral
                    examination on home ground because if you wait a year, this opening may close.”
                    It was good advice. I went back and took the orals in November in St. Paul,
                    Minnesota. Steve was the 1 person I really got to know. Other than that, I met
                    various people. My whole group was invited to the Fourth of July party at the
                    ambassador's residence. We went on that occasion. That's the only time I was in
                    any embassy. But we were living on the economy. We went there, we made our own
                    arrangements, we were not on any official exchange program. I went to the USIA
                    library on occasion in Chikalubina, which they just closed, unfortunately. And I
                    went to the USIA library in Zagreb. But other than that, I didn't spend that
                    much time with embassy people.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You took the Foreign Service exam in St. Paul. When was
                        this?SCANLAN: I got home late September and they had a traveling panel that
                        came through in November of 1955. I took the exam in June of '55 and I was
                        up before a panel in November '55.</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall any of the questions or what the panel was
                        after when they talked to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: They asked me quite a bit about the Soviet Union, a variety of factual
                    questions. They asked me factual questions about U.S. history, U.S. geography.
                    They asked me what states bordered on Kentucky. I asked them if I couldn't talk
                    about those that bordered on Minnesota. They wanted Kentucky. There was a person
                    on the panel from the Department of Commerce who was appalled at my ignorance of
                    international economic matters. I remember that. But I don't remember very many
                    specific details.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came into the Foreign Service when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>SCANLAN: The process moved much more rapidly in those days. Right after the
                    panel, they sent me out of the room and then they called me back in and offered
                    me an appointment. I accepted. The next step was 2 things: the physical
                    examination and the security check. I was then a Reserve officer and military
                    intelligence army captain. I had a Russian DP interrogation team in the
                    Reserves, which was a very nice arrangements. I had 3 Russian DPs who were
                    students at the University of Minnesota. We met every Monday night for 2 hours
                    and spoke Russian, which was very useful for me. That, I think, helped, since I
                    had to have clearances for that. I think it helped with the clearance process. I
                    got a call sometime in early February offering me an appointment in early March
                    of 1956. But I had obligated myself to a 2 week active duty tour at Fifth Army
                    headquarters in Chicago in March, so we agreed for April. I entered the Foreign
                    Service on April 6, 1956. It was a very fast process. Nowadays, it takes at
                    least twice that long. I have a son in the Foreign Service and it took him at
                    least twice that long to go through the entire process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you characterize the class you came in with and some
                        of your training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: We took the A100 course, at that time a 3 month course. They split it.
                    If you got a Washington assignment, you only did the first 6 weeks of the
                    course, which was a general introduction to the Foreign Service without any
                    specific consular training or anything like that. It was pretty general. A lot
                    of senior people in the Department came over and talked to us about what the
                    Foreign Service was, how it was organized, what the Department of State was, how
                    it was organized. The highlight was, we took a week trip to New York. I don't
                    think they do that now, but it was marvelous. We all flew to New York. We did a
                    variety of things there. We went out on tugboats with the INS and people to meet
                    oceanliners coming in, which was great fun. We observed the INS and Customs
                    procedures on the boats as they were coming in to New York Harbor. We went out
                    and met the Queen Mary and the Andrea Doria. A few months later, the Andrea
                    Doria was at the bottom of the sea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I went on the Andrea Doria.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: Of course, there was the United Nations, Seamens' Hearing, all of these
                    things that you might have to do overseas.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>The thing that I remember best is, I had been in New York only once in my life
                    for 1 or 2 days. So, in the evenings, we had free time. I went to see “My Fair
                    Lady,” which had only been on Broadway for a few weeks at that time. Jim
                    Rosenthal, a friend of mine in the class, and I got orchestra seats for $7.00. I
                    remember going out at intermission and looking at Jim and saying, “Gosh, I can't
                    believe this is happening to a guy from Thief River Falls, Minnesota.” We also
                    saw “Damn Yankees” and then a drama called “Hatful of Rain.” We went down to
                    Greenwich Village and saw “Three Penny Opera.” Both Jim and I were baseball fans
                    and we went to Yankee Stadium and saw a baseball game. It was a great week.</p>
                <p>But that trip helped reinforce the feeling that you were in a very special
                    profession, that you were going to do some very important work for your country
                    overseas. Travel in those days was... There were no jet airplanes.
                    Communications were not as rapid. So, you felt you were going to be the extended
                    arm of your country, which was the most important country in the world. It was a
                    very good feeling.</p>
                <p>But it was a 6 week course and I was assigned to the Department, to INR as a
                    half-time Soviet analyst and half-time on Yugoslavia. Then in the fall of that
                    year, '56, when you had the Hungarian Revolution and the Polish October, they
                    needed another analyst on Poland, so they said, “You can read Russian and
                    Serbian. Polish won't be too difficult for you.” So they switched me to being a
                    full-time Polish analyst. As a result, I only did the first 6 weeks of that
                    course. About half my class went overseas and about half stayed in Washington.
                    Then 2 years later when I was assigned to Moscow, I went back and did the second
                    half of the A100 course, which was largely very detailed consular training,
                    particularly in visas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the INR side, what was your impression of what we knew
                        about the Soviet Union when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: INR was a very big operation in those days. A couple of years later, a
                    lot of their functions and assets were transferred to Langley to CIA. But in
                    1956 I was very impressed with the caliber of analysts in INR, with the scope of
                    the operation. I learned techniques of gathering, collating, evaluating, and
                    analyzing information that I had been unaware of before in my academic career,
                    where we worked mainly from open texts that were available. It was a good
                    operation. But it was in the throes of Wristonization, the integration of the
                    Foreign Service. A lot of these analysts didn't want to be in the Foreign
                    Service. They were extremely good analysts with tremendous academic credentials,
                    but they weren't terribly interested... Some did, but most of them didn't want
                    to go into the Foreign Service, but they were forced into it. My own view is, I
                    think we destroyed an excellent research service because those who didn't want
                    to go into the Foreign Service either left or transferred to CIA or something
                    like that. I was impressed with the quality of the people and the quality of the
                    product.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our attitude towards the Soviet Union at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: This was right in the middle of the Cold War. This was '56-'58. We
                    regarded the Soviet Union as a major threat to our way of life. We regarded them
                    in those days as capable of imperialist adventure, so to speak. This was during
                    the period of massive nuclear buildup on both sides and lots of talk beginning
                    about so-called “missile gap,” which later on turned out to be inaccurate. There
                    was a great concern about the possibility of some eventual conflict with the
                    Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved in the Hungarian revolt of '56?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: I was in INR at the time. That's when they did some realignment of
                    assets. In the division I was in, Biographic Information, which dealt with
                    analyzing cadres and leadership and movement within leadership groups and what
                    have you, it was decided they needed to strengthen the Polish side and I was
                    assigned to work with... At that time, they only had one Polish analyst in that
                    division. But that was true throughout INR. They started putting more people
                    working on Hungary and Poland. There wasn't just Hungary. That was the time when
                    Gomulka sort of looked like he was going to become a Tito-like figure, which in
                    retrospect was an exaggerated notion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the attitude in INR towards Yugoslavia? Did they
                        feel that Tito was with us or against us?SCANLAN: At that time, it was sort
                        of in a transitional period. You found people on both sides who felt that
                        Tito's break with Moscow was a hoax. They were in a minority. We found more
                        people outside of government than in government. I remember one congressman,
                        Representative Judd from Minnesota, was a strong advocate of that belief,
                        but he was also very much of that mind...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the son of missionaries and very much a Chiang
                        Kai-shek...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: Very much a Chiang Kai-shek China lobby.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>But within the Department, certainly within INR, they were watching Yugoslavia
                    very carefully, but the preponderance of belief was that Tito's break with
                    Moscow was real and that we had done the right thing in coming to his aid
                    militarily and economically and that his heresy had given birth to the Hungarian
                    revolution in a sense and emboldened the Poles, but we were a little bit
                    disappointed with his behavior with regard to Hungary. Initially, they had
                    supported the Hungarian revolution. In the end, they caved to Soviet pressure.
                    Nadge was in their embassy, they surrendered him to the Russians, who killed
                    him. So, there was a slight ambivalence toward Yugoslavia at that time but still
                    a feeling that it was better to have Yugoslavia outside the Warsaw Pact than
                    inside the Warsaw Pact. It kept the Russians off the Adriatic and probably
                    helped keep communism from prevailing in Italy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe events in Poland? People think about
                        October '56, the Suez crisis, the Hungarian revolt, and Poland sort of gets
                        ignored.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: It was a very important period in Polish history because by Gomulka's
                    return to power and by sending home Marshall Rokossovsky, for instance, who was
                    the Russian of Polish origin that the Russians had imposed upon Poland in 1948
                    as Minister of Defense - but not just Rokossovsky; there were dozens of high
                    ranking other ranking Polish Russian officers who were sent homPoland took
                    charge of its own destiny again but remained very much a member of the Warsaw
                    Pact. It was important from the point of view that from that point on, we were
                    able to have something of a special relationship with Poland, which had been
                    impossible before from the time the communists prevailed in Poland in 1947 up
                    through '56. Poland was a very loyal member of the Warsaw Pact and you might
                    well have dealt with Poland through Moscow. That was no longer the case after
                    '56. Even though by '61 or so Gomulka had begun to impose a somewhat harsher
                    regime on Poland, they had a period of flowering between '56 and '61, more or
                    less, where the better minds in Poland were able to express themselves. We got
                    deeply involved in that period and remained involved in very large exchange
                    programs. The Ford Foundation went in there between '56 and '61 and brought to
                    the USA well over 50 very carefully selected leading minds in the Polish
                    academic world. We trained a whole school of Polish sociologists. Poland
                    remained from that point on much more open to western influence than before or
                    than any of the other countries in the Warsaw Pact. I can recall in the early
                    '60s meeting a Russian sociologist who told me he had learned to read Polish in
                    order to keep up with western sociology because everything was printed in Polish
                    journals but not in Russian journals. So, a lot was going on in Poland.
                    Historians will look back and say this was a momentous occasion. In '56, you had
                    the Poznan riots.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were these?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>SCANLAN: That was mainly over economic issues. A huge machinebuilding plant in
                    Poznan called the Cegielski Works... Workers rioted, rose up. They attacked the
                    secret party headquarters in Poznan. There were quite a few people killed on
                    both sides. It was put down by the Polish army. That helped them keep things
                    boiling and resulted in Gomulka coming back into power and confronting
                    Khrushchev in October 1956. But then periodically in later years, in '68, you
                    had student uprisings. In 1970, you had worker uprisings in Szeczin and Gdansk.
                    Then again in '76. Then eventually Solidarity in 1980. So, I think the basis for
                    all of this was established in October 1956 when Poland took charge even under
                    the Polish Communist Party of its own destiny while remaining very much
                    subservient to Moscow with regard to foreign affairs, being a member of the
                    Warsaw Pact, and what have you. But internally, things remained at various
                    periods pretty much in flux churning all the time, competing leadership groups,
                    what have you, all claiming to be communists but in fact Polish nationalist
                    communist to some extent. Stalin once said that making a communist out of a Pole
                    is like putting a saddle on a cow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of INR? You had been over to the
                        highly charged, well honed Russian one. When you moved over to the Polish
                        side, there was one analyst there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: This was 1 division of INR called the Office of Biographic Information,
                    where we did cadre analysis, leadership analysis, tried to plot careers and what
                    have you, and through that analyze policy directions. INR as a whole, I don't
                    know how many people were working on Poland or on other areas within INR, the
                    general analytical side of INR as opposed to the office I was in.</p>
                <p>In my office, we tended to have 1 person on each of the Warsaw Pact countries
                    except the Soviet Union, where there were about 6.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get the impression that all of a sudden we wanted
                        to take a new look at Poland at this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>SCANLAN: Yes. The Polish-American community was pushing this in late '56. They
                    were euphoric about Gomulka. They identified Gomulka right away, erroneously as
                    it turned out. They glorified it in a sense and they believed that that movement
                    in Poland in October was going to continue to move in an anti-Russian,
                    anti-communist direction, which I thought was very naive. They believed they
                    were going to have free elections and what have you. I must say, I quickly
                    concluded that that wasn't going to happen, that Gomulka was acceptable to the
                    Russians because even though he was a locally produced Polish communist rather
                    than an imposed Moscow communist, nevertheless, he was a communist, he was a
                    true believer, and the Russians believed that he would sort of keep this thing
                    from going any further, so they were willing to try to work with him. The
                    Polish-American community very romantically and very emotionally thought they
                    were going to see a continuation of a movement that would overthrow the
                    communist regime. It didn't happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where you were, you were somewhat insulated from domestic
                        politics, but did you feel the hand of the Polish-American group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: I wouldn't say we were. After all, there were Polish-Americans working
                    in the State Department. There was a sort of a euphoria at the time. The
                    Hungarian movement was put down very quickly and very brutally. The Polish
                    movement was not. Poland succeeded in getting rid of all the so-called Russian
                    advisors or at least the more visible Russian advisors. Dozens of people were
                    sent back to Moscow. There was no military. There was sort of a facedown between
                    Russian military forces and Polish military forces that never got within firing
                    range. There was a facedown at Okiencze Airport in Warsaw between Khrushchev and
                    Gomulka, on which occasion Gomulka told Khrushchev, “You have a choice. You can
                    work with me and I can keep this thing from getting out of control. Or you can
                    start shooting and it will be out of control very rapidly.” But the Polish
                    movement then was not crushed as the Hungarian one was. Therefore, there were
                    legitimate reasons for people who felt very strongly about Poland and very
                    emotionally about Poland to believe that the movement would continue to grow and
                    move in the direction of greater freedom, greater independence, whereas
                    Gomulka's approach was quite the opposite. “Okay, it's gone this far and we'll
                    leave it at this level for as long as we have to, but we are gradually going to
                    reimpose our Polish police state control over things. But it will be a more
                    benign police state than the preceding existing Russian controlled one.”</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>In the process, Poland opened up to the west in many ways and remained open to
                    the west in many ways, which kept the ferment alive, which wasn't true anyplace
                    else in the Warsaw Pact. Hungary later on in the late '60s came out with a New
                    Economic Mechanism, which curiously was an acronym of NEM, which means “no” in
                    Hungarian. But that was purely economic. I would say even as late as the late
                    '70s we didn't have the kind of academic and cultural and informational exchange
                    programs with Hungary that we had had in Poland continuously from the late '50s
                    all the way through to the '60s and '70s. This helps keep hopes, aspirations
                    alive. It keeps people informed. It keeps people in touch with the west. And all
                    of this stemmed from October '56.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we keeping an eye on the Church?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From what you were gathering, what was the role of the
                        Church?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: We regarded Cardinal Wyszynski to be the legitimate leader of the Polish
                    nation. He was that highly regarded. And the Polish Church was very powerful.
                    The Polish communists would persecute them in many ways, would try to keep them
                    from getting even more powerful, but were never able to crush them. Wyszynski
                    was a brilliant Church leader and recognized that. We used to say that he and
                    Gomulka would go at each other like a couple of squabbling parish priests, but
                    Wyszynski never gave in and Gomulka never was able to crush him. We followed
                    Church leadership as much as we could. We had better sources of information
                    about that. Many of them traveled to the west. Many of them were imprisoned for
                    various periods of time. Wyszynski was under house arrest for several years in
                    the '50s. One of the things that happened in October '56 was that he was able
                    from that point on to operate more freely.Q: Were we getting information through
                    the Holy See?</p>
                <p>SCANLAN: Not to my knowledge. We probably were, but I don't recall seeing
                    documents in our files from the Holy See. I don't think we needed it. We'd get
                    so many reports. There was a lot of contact between American Catholic leaders
                    and Polish Catholic leaders and a lot of Polish-Americans going there and coming
                    back and giving us reports. We probably were, but I don't recall seeing any
                    reports that were specifically identified as having originated in the Holy
                    See.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You finished with INR when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>SCANLAN: The spring of 1958 I was asked if I would accept an assignment to
                    Moscow, which delighted me, as general services officer. I didn't know what a
                    general services officer did in those days. I was told that I would be
                    responsible for logistical support and maintenance of the embassy and embassy
                    housing. I was delighted to be able to go to Moscow. I then went back and took
                    the second part of the A100 course. On my own time, I did some Russian language
                    refresher through one of the teachers at the FSI who had been earlier at the
                    University of Minnesota and I knew him. On his own time and my own time, we got
                    together several hours a week. Then they gave me 2 weeks general services
                    training and out to Moscow. I went to Moscow in mid-July 1958.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: I was there for a little over 2 years. I left in mid-late July 1960. I
                    actually got married on June 28, 1958. We spent about a week in Washington after
                    we got married because I couldn't get visas for my wife until she became my
                    wife, so that was a pretty hectic week. Then we got on a plane and flew to
                    Europe and spent about 10 days going through Europe, various stops, a hectic
                    honeymoon on the way to Moscow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from '58 to '60. What was your impression
                        of the Soviet Union when you first arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: Our arrival was rather unusual. We went by train from Vienna via Prague
                    to Warsaw because I wanted to see something of that countryside but also because
                    the embassy wanted us to escort in a shipment for the embassy commissary. In
                    those days, we could ship anything we wanted to into Poland. Poles were very
                    liberal in that respect. But we couldn't into Moscow. Some things we could get
                    in; some things we couldn't. So, what we would do is, we would ship things from
                    the Berlin commissary to Warsaw and then we would have a diplomatic traveler
                    going into Moscow pick it up in Warsaw, go in by train, and this shipment would
                    be in the baggage car as part of his personal effects going into Moscow. We were
                    asked to go in via Warsaw and take in 6 tons of frozen meat for the embassy
                    commissary. Part of that operation was, you had to observe the transfer at the
                    border because at the border, the Polish trains were on European standard track
                    and Russian trains were on Russian broadguage track. At the border, they would
                    take the train off to a railroad yard where they had a system where they would
                    jack them up and take out the Polish wheels and put in the Russian wheels. But
                    they didn't do that with the baggage car. They just pulled up to the baggage
                    shed, which was right near the passenger depot. On one side of the baggage shed
                    was European gauge and the other side was Russian gauge. You had to go there and
                    visually make sure the boxes of meat were transferred.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>Well, this was right when we landed troops in Lebanon. And the Russians decided
                    to make an issue of it. When we were in Warsaw for about 3 days, the first big
                    demonstration was held in front of our embassy. Khrushchev was really rattling
                    his saber and suggesting that the Russians were not going to sit back and idly
                    watch this take place. There was actually something of a genuine war scare. So,
                    the embassy in Warsaw asked Moscow whether we should go ahead or hold back a
                    while. Obviously, they needed their frozen meat. They said we should go. So we
                    got on the train in Warsaw. When we got to the border, there was no incident. I
                    watched them transfer the meat and we got back on the train. Now we were on a
                    Russian train going from Brest on the border to Moscow, which was an overnight
                    ride. The Russian trains in those days had loudspeakers in each of the cabins.
                    We had a sleeping compartment. But you couldn't turn the loudspeaker all the way
                    off. You could reduce the volume, but you could still hear it. We were getting
                    all of this bellicose business about mobilization of Russian troops and
                    “Americans must take their hands off Lebanon” sort of thing. Fortunately, my
                    wife did not at that time understand Russian and I didn't tell her what I was
                    hearing.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>We arrived in Moscow at Belorussian Station - they had 6 or 7 stations in Moscow
                    and this was the station that came in from the west from Polanexpecting to be
                    met by the embassy. We were out at the end of a long platform. The Russian
                    porters, who liked to work for the Americans because we'd give them some
                    cigarettes and things like that, were there waiting because they knew that
                    somebody was going to be on the train. So, we got off were there waiting because
                    they knew that somebody was going to be on the train. So, we got off the train.
                    We had at least 6 pieces of personal baggage and Peggy in her arrival suit with
                    a little hat and everything. They unloaded everything, including the meat, in a
                    pile on the platform and half a dozen Russian porters standing around waiting
                    for the people from the embassy and nobody came from the embassy. We waited
                    about 15 minutes and they still didn't come. So, I talked to the head porter and
                    he said, “Don't worry. They'll be here.” Another 15 minutes, they didn't come.
                    So, I didn't know whether we were at war with Russia or not at that point. So, I
                    said to my wife, “Why don't you stay here with our things?” I asked these guys,
                    “Are there pay phones?” They said, “Oh, yes, there are pay phones up at the
                    depot,” which was at least 100 yards off. By this time, we were a lonely group
                    at the end of the platform. Peggy stayed with the baggage and the porters, not
                    terribly confident about her welfare. There were 2 pay phones. One was out of
                    order and the other had a line of about 10 people waiting to use it. I thought,
                    “This won't work,” so I walked back again. It seemed like a week but it must
                    have been 45 minutes to an hour before they finally came from the embassy, a
                    sedan and a truck. In the truck were 4 Russian workers who worked for us. In the
                    sedan there was a Russian driver. He was a building maintenance officer. I later
                    on worked with him in GSO. A very nice but kind of excitable fellow named Ted
                    Chariot. He got out and said, “Sorry we're late. We're having a little
                    excitement in the embassy but don't worry about anything. Did you get the meat?
                    Did you get the meat?” It turned out that the last traveler had somehow or other
                    not watched the transaction at the border and they lost about 4 tons of frozen
                    meat. He said, “Okay, you and your wife get in the car and the driver will take
                    you back to the embassy. Don't worry about your baggage. I'll take care of
                    that.” We get into the car, the driver pulls up, pretty soon we're on the
                    Koltso, this big 16 lane street that Stalin constructed. We get up near the
                    embassy and I see the embassy slightly ahead of us. There must have been by that
                    time 5,000 or more Russian demonstrators out in front of the embassy being held
                    back by a couple hundred militiamen, including 40-50 on horseback. You could see
                    that things had already started there. Noisy demonstration. So, I said to the
                    driver, who didn't speak English (I remember his name was Tikho Mirov, which in
                    Russian sort of means “quietly, peacefully”)... I knew we had reservations in a
                    hotel, so I said to him, “Mozhet' mi poyedim v gostinitzu? [Maybe it's better to
                    go to the hotel and call the embassy].” He said, “Nyet, nyet, no, no. Everything
                    will be alright.” He just said, “Lock the doors and we'll be in the embassy
                    soon.” So, I told Peggy, “Don't worry about it. These people are here because
                    they're told to be here. This is not a violent crowd and it'll be alright.” He
                    pulled up and lined himself up with the gate to the embassy and did a right
                    angle turn and started nudging his car through the crowd. They started rocking
                    the car a little bit and banging gently on the windows. Poor Peggy sort of
                    looked at me. I said, “Don't worry. These people are not an angry crowd. They
                    were trucked in from the factories and they're not going to do...” When we got
                    up near the embassy, the police finally came out and opened the lane for us. We
                    got up to the embassy gate and there were Marines behind the gate and they
                    opened the gates, let us in, and closed the gates. People were there and said,
                    “Welcome to Moscow.”</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>Then we were taken up to a fourth floor apartment. About half of our apartments
                    in those days were in the Tchaikovsky building. We were taken up to the fourth
                    floor apartment of my boss for lunch. In the middle of lunch, an ink bottle came
                    through the window. We could hear the loudspeakers outside saying, “Raz, dva,
                    tri ruki protiv ot Liban. And 1, 2, 3, hands off Lebanon!” At a certain point,
                    they gave them ink bottles and stones and all the small boys and young men were
                    told to fire at the embassy. They started showering us with ink bottles and
                    stones. We moved up to the seventh floor to the DCM's apartment, where he had a
                    television set. We were watching this process on television. Finally after a
                    couple of hours, by that time, it had reached 80,000 people. The police said,
                    “Okay, demonstration's over. Everybody go home.” Most of the people went without
                    any trouble, but there were some people whose adrenaline had got worked up in
                    the frontlines. The police had to very gently push their horses into the crowd,
                    moving them back until it was all dispersed. Something like 163 windows in our
                    building were broken. Of course, the whole building was stained with ink. Many
                    apartments, rugs, were stained.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't that the last time they used the ink?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: Yes, that was the last time. That was the last time there was ever a
                    really violent demonstration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess the bill came in and they...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: Yes, the bill came in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is your responsibility.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>SCANLAN: People were kind of exhausted after this day. It was 6:00 or 7:00 at
                    night by then. We were put in an embassy car and sent to the Leningradskaya
                    Gostinitza, one of these tall Gothic style high rise buildings that they had in
                    Moscow. About 7 of them were gathered around the city. Two of them were hotels.
                    Here we were, first night in Moscow. We were all alone in this cavernous room
                    they gave us in the hotel. We didn't sleep too comfortably. This was a Friday.
                    The embassy in those days worked Saturdays. I went in. I found that we did have
                    one empty apartment that we had just acquired in an area about 5 kilometers
                    away, a place we called Prospekt Mira after the street, Peace Prospect. We had
                    20 units in that building. There were well over 100 diplomatic units that the
                    Soviets had set up. We had about 20 where we had fixed up the apartments,
                    linking 2, putting in our own appliances. We had 3 new small 1 bedroom
                    apartments that we hadn't fixed up. Everything was Russian. The stove was a
                    crummy old gas stove. The sinks... We ultimately replaced all the stuff. I said,
                    “Could we move into an apartment? It's not very comfortable being in a hotel
                    after that kind of arrival.” So, they agreed. We didn't have much adequate
                    furniture for it, but they took me out and showed it to me. There were no
                    provisions for closets or drapes or anything. But we moved in enough stuff. We
                    got some old drapes which we tacked up on the windows and we got one of these
                    steel framed clothes hangars on wheels, which was our closet, and we got enough
                    other furniture to furnish the place. That was our honeymoon pad for a couple of
                    months. We gradually improved it, of course. We ultimately moved in to one-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: Llewellyn Thompson.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: Very professionally. Rather quiet, reserved individual. But a man who
                    instilled confidence in you immediately. The Russians respected him, among other
                    reasons because he had been there during World War II and had gone with the
                    Russians when they evacuated their government to Kuibeshev. It was a “He was
                    with us during the war” sort of thing. But he was very professional. Very good
                    Russian. I liked him. I felt it was a great honor to begin my diplomatic career
                    working for a man like that. Of course, I was way down in the staff. There were
                    3 first tour officers assigned: Byron Morton, Ed Horowitz, and myself. We had
                    all entered the Foreign Service with rather strong Russian either in my case
                    from academic Russian; in Bryan and Ed it was both from Army language school. We
                    had all worked in INR before going to Moscow. We had all been in a couple of
                    years and we all had third secretary jobs.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>You mentioned the bill for this. I was involved a couple days later when the
                    people came over from the support part of the Russian foreign ministry. It was
                    called UPDK, the administration for providing support services to the diplomatic
                    corps. You literally couldn't buy a nail in Moscow without going through them.
                    It was that tightly controlled. But they came over. I remember walking through
                    with them. We ran the bill up as much as we could. It really cost them a lot of
                    money to repair our embassy. They accepted the responsibility for doing it. It
                    was all done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they ever make any comments about who the son of a
                        bitch was that handed out the ink bottles?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: No, no, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the interesting things would be that your job
                        probably put you in closer contact with the Soviets than really the
                        political officers, who were stuck with Reading Izvestia and Pravda.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: You're right. I didn't recognize it immediately because I got involved
                    in a lot of mundane things that probably later on helped me out when I bought my
                    first home. I was supervising plumbers, electricians, carpenters, the char
                    force, painters, what have you. We had 80 housing units. I was the only Russian
                    language speaking officer on the administrative staff. I was out on the street a
                    lot, more than in the embassy. I was out doing customs clearance, negotiating
                    with the UPDK, where the people didn't speak English. I had a great opportunity
                    to practice my Russian at very practical levels. It was great. I was out in the
                    city more dealing with Russians at various levels. There were certain things
                    they let us do. If we wanted to get a batch of furniture reupholstered or
                    something like that, UPDK would say, “Fine, you can use 1 of 2 or 3 shops.”
                    They'd facilitate it and then we'd go and deal directly with people. I had some
                    fascinating conversations on many occasions with Russians who would get to know
                    me. It was great. From that point of view, it was marvelous. Also from the point
                    of view of learning an awful lot about electricity, plumbing, carpentry, and
                    what have you, which served me well several years later when we bought our first
                    house in Falls Church and I became a harried homeowner.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get the feeling that UPDK was trying to give you a
                        rough time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>SCANLAN: Yes. You could measure the state of our relations. When our relations
                    were good, it was very easy to deal with them. We could get anything we wanted
                    that was available. Of course, that was a measure right there. They were
                    friendly, they were helpful, they were responsive when things were going well.
                    When our relations were bad, when there were incidents of various kinds, it was
                    like pulling teeth to get even the most modest type of need fulfilled. That was
                    true in general in Moscow in those days. There were not very many tourists
                    there. There was a very small western presence. There were no western
                    businesses. There was a fairly sizable corps of foreign correspondents, but they
                    were all subject to censorship. They couldn't file stories without going through
                    censorship. And if they violated that, they would be expelled. The Russians had
                    it very well controlled. There were fewer diplomatic missions then and they were
                    smaller. On the one hand, there was a tight foreign community. On the other
                    hand, there was a sense of doing something very important because you were a
                    small presence in an alien world. The other good thing about it was, there were
                    so few of us there that you could go to the Bolshoi Theater on a moment's notice
                    and it probably only cost you about $1.50. What was there was available, 6
                    really quite good restaurants. I liked the Russian theaters because my Russian
                    was quite good and you could go anytime you wanted to go. Now, I understand that
                    not only does it cost $50-60 or more to go to a Bolshoi, but you maybe get to go
                    twice in a tour or something like that. There were advantages and disadvantages
                    to being there during the height of the Cold War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As GSO, you were part of the cadre. What was your
                        impression of the American Russian service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: I was very impressed. I felt very fortunate to be associated with those
                    people. They were a very impressive lot. I thought my Russian was very
                    serviceable and quite good, but I stood in awe of some that were in my view much
                    better, including Ambassador Thompson, people like Lou Bowden, Vlad Toumanoff,
                    Harry Barnes. And not just the language but their understanding, their
                    knowledge, their background. They were impressive people. They helped give me
                    the inspiration to try to measure up to what I perceived them to be doing,
                    although in fact, I probably had the advantage of being out on the street more
                    and out among ordinary Russians more than anyone. They traveled quite a bit. In
                    those days when you traveled everything had to be approved by the Russians in
                    advance. A third of the country at least was out of bounds. You couldn't go more
                    than 50 kilometers from the center of Moscow without permission. And they would
                    give you permission or deny it at the last minute. They made all the
                    reservations for you, the hotels, the trains, every place you went you had to
                    have an Intourist guide. Of course, the Intourist guide was actually KGB. They
                    followed you.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>They worked all 3 of the junior officers into travel programs. It was a fairly
                    small embassy and you couldn't travel alone. Frequently a political officer
                    would come to see one of us working in another section and say, “I want to take
                    such and such a trip. I need somebody to go. Could you go with me?” You'd ask
                    your boss if he'd let you off. I took several trips with people in the political
                    section. One fascinating trip was with our cultural counselor, who you'd call a
                    PAO today, when I went with him to 5 cities in Central Asia. It was the first
                    time he got permission to visit universities in that part of the Soviet Union.
                    We went on a 2 week trip and visited 5 Central Asian universities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the situation in Central Asia
                        at that time? Was there any knowledge or interest in the United States that
                        you found?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: They controlled your contact very much. We were dealing almost
                    exclusively with English speaking university professors, mainly English
                    departments in universities. We would always have the usual formal meeting with
                    the rector, maybe his deputy. They'd maybe entertain us on 1 occasion or
                    another. The only students we were able to have contact with were students of
                    the English language. My impression at that time was that there was a great deal
                    of segregation in education there between the Central Asians and the Russians
                    even in the English department. We noticed this in places like Frunze (now
                    Bishkek), in Alma-Ata (now Almaty), Samarkand... There would be a Russian
                    language university and an Uzbek language university. There was a great deal of
                    segregation. We also noticed that the students of English tended to be much
                    better in the Russian universities than in the Central Asian universities. You
                    really got the impression of the colonial presence of Russians in those
                    countries, probably a little bit less in Uzbekistan because there weren't as
                    many Russians there. But by and large, you got that impression that this was a
                    colonial empire. The Russians had brought technical modernization and some other
                    things there, but by and large, they were the colonial masters. You clearly got
                    that impression. All the important officials seemed to be Russian. I was there
                    last summer to visit my son who was in the embassy in Kyrgyzstan. Now it's quite
                    the opposite, the senior officials are mostly Kyrgyz.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On these trips, were you harassed at all by the KGB?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>SCANLAN: There were incidents. I never was. We were clearly followed and
                    sometimes very obviously followed even though we were assigned an Intourist
                    guide. But the Intourist guide wouldn't be with us all the time. You'd walk
                    around the city and be by yourself when you weren't going on official programs.
                    But you always had a sense of being followed. Sometimes it was very obvious. One
                    time I went with Bob Owen, a political officer, head of the internal part of the
                    political section, to Gorky. Then we went by train from Gorky to a place called
                    Penze. Gorky has now reverted to its own name [Nizhniy Novgorod]. In Gorky we
                    were followed very obviously, almost humorously. They'd keep changing their
                    headgear. We used to call it the Comical Hats Program. The same people were
                    following us all the time. Then we went by train to Penze. On the train we met a
                    fellow in our compartment from Penze who was very friendly. I think he was
                    legitimate. He invited us to his apartment in Penze, wanted us to come and visit
                    him. He had been in the Red Army right at the end of World War II and he claimed
                    he had met some American soldiers. He didn't speak more than a few words of
                    English, but he remembered this experience fondly. My recollection is that he
                    was an engineer or something. He had an apartment in the center of Penze. So, we
                    were in Penze 2 or 3 days and we debated whether or not we should go. He hadn't
                    set a time for us to go. He had given us the address. We were to come by in the
                    evening to have hors d'oeuvres and a drink. Finally we decided to risk it, not
                    for ourselves, but we didn't want to get him in trouble. We thought, “Well, he
                    asked us. Maybe he is KGB.” We went to his apartment and he and his wife
                    received us. They were extremely nervous the whole evening. We were only there a
                    couple of hours. They were friendly enough but they were very nervous. We
                    concluded that the KGB had observed us on the train and had told him, “Okay, go
                    ahead with this, but we'll be watching you and this is a black mark.” But it was
                    that controlled in those days. In 2 years, I was in 3 Russian apartments. Every
                    situation was rather similar to that. On the other 2 cases, Russians insisted on
                    taking me to their apartments, both in Moscow. In both cases, I said, “You
                    probably shouldn't be doing this.” I was a little nervous that it might have
                    been a provocation. It wasn't. It was just some Russian that thought he had more
                    freedom than he had. But it was that tight in those days.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Although you weren't working the political angle, you were
                        one of the group. What was the impression during this '58-'60 period of
                        Khrushchev?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>SCANLAN: It was a period where it looked like there was going to be an opening to
                    better relations. In the summer of 1959, Nixon visited Moscow. We had the
                    exchange of exhibits, the big American exhibit in Sokolniki Park in July 1959.
                    The Soviets had a big exhibit in New York. Nixon visited Moscow. It was sort of
                    an opening. Khrushchev's deputy went to the United States. Then there were plans
                    made for an Eisenhower visit to Moscow which was to have taken place in June
                    1960. I think our initial view of Khrushchev was that he was something of a
                    buffoon. On the other hand, he had made that famous destalinization speech to
                    the 20th Congress. So, there was something to him. On the other hand, some of
                    his behavior was either oafish or just bizarre in a way. He would buy on to
                    slogans like “You can grow corn anywhere.” We used to jokingly refer to him as
                    “King Corn.” Slogans like “Anywhere you can grow wheat, you can also grow corn.”
                    This slogan was widely displayed on billboards. He was trying to move Russia
                    into being a more dynamic, more productive society. We didn't recognize right
                    away some of the things that we now recognize, that he was maybe premature but
                    was trying to do... It was early detente. We didn't call it “detente” at the
                    time. He was genuine in this. But initially we regarded him as a buffoon.</p>
                <p>Then from the summer of '59 on until the U2 in May of '60, relations warmed up
                    considerably. We had 2 or 3 minor incidents, but by and large relations warmed
                    up. It looked like we were going to really move forward in relations. We then
                    regarded Khrushchev as a liberal force in the Soviet sense.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Thompson developed a very good relationship with Khrushchev on
                    Khrushchev's trip to the United States.Q: Had that taken place while you were in
                    Moscow?</p>
                <p>SCANLAN: Yes, it took place... Nixon came to Moscow in July of 1957. Khrushchev
                    went to the United States that fall or early in '60. Thompson accompanied him on
                    that trip. Americans sometimes behave in strange ways. When Khrushchev went to
                    Los Angeles, he wanted to see Hollywood and Disneyland. Hollywood... He was
                    offended by the way they treated him in Hollywood.</p>

                </p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: About making it big in America.</hi>

                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>SCANLAN: That's right, about what he had done as a Greek. Then they had these can
                    can dancers. Then he was told he couldn't go to Disneyland because it hadn't
                    been in the initial plan and we couldn't guarantee security. The reporters were
                    beginning to be beastly at that time, too. He went into a supermarket... We were
                    kind of throwing American affluence in his face. “Look how good we've got it.”
                    There were some good moments when he was at the Garst Farm in Iowa and things
                    like that. But Los Angeles was bad and it looked like the trip was really going
                    to turn out badly.</p>
                <p>It was at this point when Thompson spent a lot of time with him. They went by
                    train from Los Angeles to San Francisco. Thompson calmed him down and worked
                    with the mayor of San Francisco, Christopher, and got things back on track and
                    came back to Moscow feeling that he had developed a good relationship with
                    Khrushchev, as indeed he had. From that point on, even after U2 when there was a
                    freeze of a month or so and the cancellation of the Eisenhower visit, as long as
                    Thompson was in Moscow, he had a pretty good relationship with Khrushchev. As a
                    matter of fact, later on in the '61-'62 period, when we got over the U2 thing,
                    Thompson and his family used to go out to Khrushchev's dacha as his personal
                    guest. We developed great respect for Khrushchev.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did things get tense at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: Very much so, yes. It really hit us by surprise. It happened on May 1.
                    There was a famous photographer for “Life Magazine” who had been assigned to
                    Moscow a year or so before that. He and his charming wife and 2 kids lived in a
                    suite in the National Hotel, which had a great view of Red Square, looking right
                    into Red Square. He invited a group of people to a May 1st party to watch the
                    parade from his apartment. Carl Mayden was his name. Very nice person. We were
                    among those invited. Others invited were Clifton Daniels and his wife, Margaret
                    Truman, who were visiting Moscow at the time, and a lot of the press corpMax
                    Frankel, lots of others. We were fortunate to have been invited. We were all
                    watching this thing. I was taking movies. The start of the parade was delayed
                    for about an hour. I had a telescopic lense on my camera, one of those old 8
                    millimeter cameras with a turret. I had this on telescopic focused on the
                    mausoleum when the Marshall of the Red Army came up and reported to Khrushchev
                    and the others and they looked like they were in some sort of animated
                    conversation. Then the parade went on.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>We didn't know what had happened. We didn't find out until Saturday or Sunday.
                    There was a meeting of the Supreme Soviets a couple days later. It was at that
                    meeting that Khrushchev announced from the podium the shootdown of the U2.
                    Thompson attended. I was in the embassy when he came back. He was furious.
                    Thompson was a very calm, quiet, very well mannered person who rarely showed
                    emotion. But I just happened to be in the elevator when he came back and he was
                    obviously very upset. I wasn't in the meeting with him after that, but I was
                    told that what upset him so much was the fact that Washington had not told him.
                    He found out about that at that meeting. He was terribly embarrassed. He was
                    subsequently called in by the Soviets and read the riot act to them. Of course,
                    the Eisenhower visit was canceled. We had had a month of beautiful preparation.
                    We had had a series of events, parties, we had brought in all kinds of things,
                    including a beautiful fiberglass motor launch on a trailer which was going to be
                    Eisenhower's gift to Khrushchev and it had on the dashboard a brass plate that
                    said something like “From the President of the United States, Dwight D.
                    Eisenhower, to the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet
                    Union, Nikita Sergeyevicy Khrushchev on the occasion of the former's visit to
                    the latter in June.” This brass plate was on it. Later on, we got instructions
                    from Washington to remove the brass plate and send it back by diplomatic pouch
                    because they didn't want to be embarrassed by having this brass plate. Then we
                    wanted to keep the boat to use at our dacha. There was a nice little river and a
                    small artificial lake near our dacha. We were told, “No, you have to send the
                    boat out. Again, it could be an embarrassment to have that boat.” It was under
                    canvas. We had brought it in by air. So, we had to send it back out. I guess we
                    sent it out by rail. Things got chilly pretty fast then after that and remained
                    chilly for the remainder of our tour. We left in July.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you and your wife find the social life in Moscow
                        at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: It was totally controlled from the Soviet side. You had very little
                    social contact with the Soviets. You could invite 50 people and maybe 2-4 would
                    come. And only officials would come. It was a little bit better during that
                    honeymoon period between Khrushchev's visit to the United States and the U2. But
                    usually either controlled official presences or cultural people who were
                    involved in cultural exchange. We began to get invited to more things by the
                    Russians, usually musicales or receptions in honor of cultural exchanges.
                    Leonard Bernstein came with the New York Philharmonic. But as far as informal
                    home entertainment, it was almost exclusively the diplomatic corps and other
                    resident foreigners, which meant the press corps. That was your social life. But
                    it was pretty lively, maybe sometimes too lively, with 6 or more events a week.
                    We were never bored.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Soviets into foreign students at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>SCANLAN: The first student exchange agreement was formalized with the Russians in
                    the fall of 1958. I was at a reception in the DCM's apartment where this was
                    anointed and toasted. The people who had come from Washington to negotiate it
                    and their Soviet counterparts were there. In those days, we never said
                    “Russian.” We always said “Soviet.” I remember vividly that reception. We were
                    invited. It was kind of nice being the youngest people in the embassy because
                    they usually invited us to anything that had to do with youth or students. It
                    was a formal agreement. The exchange was supposed to be 20 for 20. It was a
                    graduate student exchange. The following year, the first group of Americans
                    came, maybe not even 20. But most of the Americans were at the University of
                    Moscow. There were 2 or 3 that were in other places. Among those that came, we
                    became close friends with Bill and Heidi Shinn. A year or 2 after that, Bill
                    joined the Foreign Service and had a very good career. Unfortunately, he came
                    down with Parkinsons and had to leave right at the time when we thought he was
                    going to move onward and upward probably to ambassadorial level. But Bill and
                    Heidi were in that first group of American students. They were from Minnesota.
                    I'm from Minnesota. So we developed a good friendship then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about foreign students? Did you get any feel of how
                        foreign students were being treated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: There were a lot of African students there. They had this Patrice
                    Lumumba University. Some of the African students seemed to feel pleased that
                    they were there and others seemed to feel that they weren't being treated very
                    well. We did on occasion see some of these African students, particularly those
                    who were unhappy and hoped that they could go to the United States instead of
                    staying in the Soviet Union. But by and large we didn't see much of foreign
                    students there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there when?</hi>
                </p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During a freeze period.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>SCANLAN: Yes. There was one noteworthy incident even during that freeze period
                    which was rather interesting because of something else. I was embassy duty
                    officer sometime in mid-June, 1960. It was a Russian holiday, I think
                    Constitution Day. I got a call from a doctor in a small town named Gzhatsk,
                    which was out west of Moscow in the direction of Minsk and Poland, maybe 150
                    miles west of Moscow. This Russian doctor wanted to tell us about 2 Americans
                    who had been in an automobile accident near Gzhatsk. He had them in his
                    hospital. He said, “Our conditions aren't adequate to take care of them. I'm
                    taking care of them in my office, where I can give them better treatment.
                    They've had a lot of facial cuts, nothing serious. They're ambulatory. But
                    couldn't you come and take them off my hands?” I said, “Well, have you spoken to
                    Intourist?” There was no Intourist in Gzhatsk, but they had called Intourist in
                    Smolenski and they were entirely unresponsive. He said the Americans had been
                    traveling by car from Warsaw to Moscow on their honeymoon and had missed a turn
                    or come off a sharp turn or something and they had gone airborne and landed in a
                    ditch. I said, “Well, I'll see what we can do.” I didn't want to be caught in an
                    incident of any kind. Frankly, it was one of those days when practically
                    everyone was gone in the embassy, the ambassador, the DCM, the admin. officer. I
                    had to make decisions on my own. I called our embassy doctor, an Air Force
                    captain. Then I called back and talked to this guy. I had him put the American
                    on. He put the American on and he told me what the situation was. He said, “It's
                    pretty primitive here.” He gave me his passport number. It sounded legitimate.
                    So, we decided to give it a try. I called the foreign ministry and told them the
                    situation, asked them to verify it. They verified it and said they would give me
                    permission to go. Our Air Force captain, since he was a military attach�, had to
                    go through the military channel. He got permission.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>We both jumped in an embassy sedan. I drove 3 hours to Gzhatsk. We were tailed
                    very closely all the way. We got to Gzhatsk. Talk about squalor, a miserable
                    town, muddy red streets, wooden and log cabin houses, a few brick buildings but
                    in bad shape. We were directed to the hospital. It was a sprawling partly wood,
                    partly brick place. We went in and the doctor's office was decent but the rest
                    of the building smelled of urine and stale bandages and it was really pretty
                    bad. The doctor turned out to be a young fellow in his late 20s who spoke fairly
                    good German. I should have said these Americans spoke reasonably good German,
                    the man in particular. The Americans were mid-20s probably. The reason they had
                    been going to Moscow on their honeymoon was that his parents were of Russian
                    Jewish origin from Moscow and he wanted to go back. They didn't speak any
                    Russian. So, we agreed to take them back, but first we had to go out on the edge
                    of town to arrange to get their car hauled to Moscow. It was right near a
                    collective farm office. We went into this meeting in this really modest meeting
                    room of the collective farm with the chairman of the farm and 6 of his board
                    members and we negotiated. It seems now improbable that you could have done it
                    in those days but we negotiated for 1 of their trucks to take this car to Moscow
                    at a certain price that the American had said he would pay to take it into the
                    American embassy garage. It wasn't that badly banged up. A little sports car, a
                    convertible. The chairman of the collective farm said he'd been out by the
                    highway and he saw the accident. He said, “They took off like angels and landed
                    like the devil.” Then we even watched them load the car. In order to load the
                    car, they had to angle the truck into a ditch so that the back of the truck
                    would be at the level of the car and they pushed it up onto the truck. They took
                    off for Moscow and we went back and picked up these 2 Americans. We got about
                    half way to Moscow and we came across the truck by the edge of the highway. We
                    wondered what was going on. They were washing the truck. They said, “Oh, Moscow.
                    100 rubles fine if you've got a dirty truck or a dirty car.” We said, “You know
                    where to take it?” They said, “Yes, the American embassy address.” The whole
                    thing worked beautifully. We took these people in. Our doctor took care of them
                    for a couple of days and then they put them on a train back and arranged to have
                    their car fixed up and shipped out. But remember the miserable, squalid town?
                    Unbelievable. Shortly thereafter, the first space flight was by a man named Yuri
                    Gagarin. I read his biography. He was born in Gzhatsk. I thought to myself,
                    “What a contrast. This miserable, squalid town produces the first man in space.”
                    That is the contrast of Soviet society. You had all of the assets put into the
                    military industrial complex. They can produce things like that and they would
                    still have in the second half of the 20th century these miserable squalid towns
                    in European Russia, not in Central Asia. I tell this story only because of the
                    Gagarin part. But the other part of it was interesting, too. When I wrote up the
                    report of it, Harry Barnes, who by that time was back in Washington on the
                    Soviet desk, wrote me a nice little note of “Congratulations. You took pretty
                    good initiative. That was the right thing to do. But I'm amazed that they let
                    you do it.”</p>

                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>SCANLAN: I was assigned to Polish language training. I went back for 10 months of
                    intensive Polish. Then I went to Warsaw.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is September 4, 1996. You were in Polish language
                        training from when to when?SCANLAN: The actual training started right around
                        late August/early September 1960. We completed it in June of '61 and then
                        went off to Warsaw.</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a result of my Serbian language training, I learned an
                        awful lot about the Serbs from Mr. Popovich. Did you learn anything about
                        Poland from your language teachers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: We had only 1 teacher.</p>
                <p>You mention Serbo-Croatian. I came into the Foreign Service with a 3 in
                    Serbo-Croatian. After Moscow, I requested Yugoslavia. Instead, they sent me back
                    for Polish language training. At that time, there were 7 or 8 people in the
                    Serbo-Croatian course. There were about 4 of us in Polish, which was fine; I got
                    another Slavic language. But it would have made sense to send me right away to
                    Yugoslavia.</p>
                <p>We had a teacher named Adam Voyna. He was our only linguist. He was very good. He
                    had a brother, Richard Voyna, who had become a well known Yugoslav foreign
                    correspondent, mostly in the Middle East and subsequently I got to know him
                    somewhat in Poland because he played a rather important political role later on.
                    He became a member of the Central Committee and something of an international
                    press advisor to Gomulka's successor, Gierek, later on. But Adam Voyna had left.
                    He didn't want anything to do with People's Poland. He had come to the United
                    States, married an American after he got here. He had this job at the FSI. He
                    was also working towards a degree in linguistics at Georgetown at that time. We
                    learned a lot from him. He was quite recently out of Poland, had only been out 5
                    or 6 years. He had grown up in Poland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And well plugged in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: Yes. He still was in touch with his brother. His mother was still alive
                    and living there. He told us a lot about Poland, so we got much more than the
                    language from him. And we liked him. He was a very nice guy. I stayed in touch
                    with him for several years thereafter.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You arrived in Poland when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>SCANLAN: In July of 1961.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Poland from '61 until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: July '65. It started as a 2 year assignment and was extended.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation when you arrived in 1961 in
                        Poland?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: At that time, Gomulka was the party leader. They had gone through that
                    October '56 period where Gomulka had stood up to Khrushchev in his famous
                    meeting at Okanchi Airport. There was something of a thaw. Polish-Americans
                    overestimated the extent of the thaw, but it was still for a communist society a
                    relatively open society when I went there in mid-1961, but it was beginning to
                    change. Gomulka was beginning to clamp down and beginning to assert his
                    authority and reduce the latitude for public discussion of issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your position in the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: I initially went in as a consular officer to do everything but visas. I
                    did passports, citizenship, general welfare and protection, in the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: Jake Beam.Q: He was a professional Foreign Service officer.</p>
                <p>SCANLAN: Jake was very professional. He was there only my first 4 months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then who took over?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: There was an interim period of a couple of months. The charge was a very
                    fine professional, Albert Sherer, known to everybody as Bud Sherer. Then John
                    Moors Cabot came in right around February of 1962.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he part of the Cabots and Lodges?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>SCANLAN: Yes, a very distinguished member of a distinguished Boston Brahmin
                    family. He had had already about 4 posts, primarily Latin America, but his first
                    chief of mission was minister to Finland back in the early '50s and he was very
                    fond of that memory and he had become a devotee of the sauna. Then he was also
                    ambassador to Sweden. In South America, he had been ambassador to Colombia and
                    Brazil. He had been Assistant Secretary for ARA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he operate? Obviously, you were some distance
                        removed, but it wasn't that big an embassy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: I became less removed. I had been there something like 4 months when
                    what we would call the CAO today... In those days, USIA did not operate openly
                    in Eastern Europe. They operated as press and culture sections of the embassy.
                    As a result, they sometimes had State Department FSOs seconded to them because
                    they would all be temporarily transferred as a USIA officer. So, Yale Richmond,
                    a very experienced USIA officer and quite senior to me (he was a 3 and I was a
                    6), had a son who had been born in Poland. He had been there about 3 years and
                    developed a very serious blood disease which couldn't be treated there. Yale was
                    transferred to Vienna. They had a support office in Vienna for all of Eastern
                    Europe. USIA could not replace him immediately. It was a key job. At that point,
                    one of our main points of contact with Polish people was the cultural officer,
                    the cultural attach�. He was out all the time on the street meeting with
                    cultural personalities, academics, what have you. The atmosphere for that was
                    very open at that time and we had a rapidly expanding exchange program. They
                    looked around the embassy at who could temporarily fill this job. I had come out
                    of the FSI with 4/4 Polish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is as fluent as a non-native speaker can get.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: When I left Poland 4 years later, I got a 4/4+. That is a higher degree
                    of fluency. But 4/4 is a good level of fluency. You can operate quite
                    effectively in almost any milieu.</p>
                <p>So, I had good Polish, plus the fact that I had done some work in Moscow in a
                    USIA press and culture section there which was badly understaffed, so from time
                    to time they coopted me. They worked it out with Sherer, the charge (Bean had
                    left). It was supposed to be a temporary assignment of 6 months. But I wound up
                    staying in that position for almost 3 years. Then my last 6 months there, I was
                    acting political section chief. So, I moved out of the consular section after 4
                    months. Frankly, I had enjoyed the job in the consular section because I was
                    doing all the general consular work, which took me out on the street.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the main things that you found yourself
                        involved in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>SCANLAN: I took all the applications for American citizenship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which must have been quite a few.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: There were a lot. Then you did the initial adjudication and sent them
                    back to Washington for final adjudication. That was a quite interesting job
                    because there were a lot of people who had under the complicated citizenship law
                    a claim to American citizenship. Many of them were quite elderly people,
                    frequently even illiterate, but they had heard about this program, so they'd
                    come in. It was painful to watch many of them sign their signatures with an X.
                    But that was an active program.</p>
                <p>This was still a fairly liberal period in Poland. As I said, Gomulka was
                    beginning to tighten up, but it was open. You had a lot of Polish-Americans
                    coming back, including a lot of people who had left after the war or had been in
                    Anders Army and hadn't come back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anders Army being an army that fought with the
                        allies.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: Yes. Based primarily in Britain, but they participated very heavily in a
                    lot of major battles in Italy and Normandy and what have you. This got
                    interesting because on several occasions they would be harassed by the local
                    authorities, even arrested and passports confiscated. Most of them were smart
                    enough to make a beeline for the embassy as soon as they could. Since I was
                    doing welfare and protection, this fell to me. There were some very interesting
                    cases. You had a chance to represent them with the Polish authorities. On a
                    couple of occasions, I issued people new passports. They would report back with
                    a passport and a letter from the American vice consul saying that they enjoyed
                    the full protection of the American government. And it worked. They would come
                    back smiling and telling me that the local authorities had been very upset. But
                    it worked. I can remember going to a court trail of an American, a Church of
                    Christ sponsored Polish minister. He was accused of conducting an illegal
                    church. That was a rather heavy court trial. But the judge was very fair. This
                    guy had very affluent friends in Texas. You get involved in that. It was an
                    interesting job. It was one of the more interesting jobs in the embassy.Q: Did
                    you run across any American tourists, maybe non-Polish connected, who were
                    wandering around and getting into trouble?</p>
                <p>SCANLAN: No, I don't remember any specific cases of that kind. I remember many
                    post-World War II Polish immigrants coming back and having various problems. We
                    had death cases, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was in Germany in the '50s. We had German-Americans
                        coming back and going to the local village where they came from and lording
                        it over the people there. “In America, we do it this way, you stupid
                        people.” There was like a nouveau riche in a way. Did you have problems with
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: We never had any problems with it, but it was a quite frequent
                    occurrence where a Pole would come back and he'd go to his village. In America,
                    he might not be terribly affluent, but in terms of that village, he was the
                    richest person they had ever seen. But I don't recall friction there. I recall
                    putting on banquets. And occasional death cases. These people would be in their
                    '70s or so and they'd live it up and boom, we'd get a call from the village
                    saying, “We have a deceased American.” That happened a few times.</p>
                <p>I think Poles would react different than Germans anyway. Poles always had the
                    view that America was the great promised land. They had no antagonism toward
                    America. We had never been on opposite sides in a war. The Polish people always
                    felt, “Boy, if I could only get to America, where the streets are paved with
                    gold.” You couldn't say anything... By and large, I found this throughout my
                    term, except for high level communist officials who were giving the Party line,
                    that you couldn't criticize America to a Pole. They thought America could do no
                    wrong.</p>

                        relationship was pretty good. I never felt that I had any problems gaining
                        access to any official that I needed to see or gaining access to any premise
                        that I needed to be on. It was relatively open then. But it did get a lot
                        tougher late on.</hi>

                    American society, keeping their spirits up. We had a very rapidly expanding
                    program. Within certain reasonable limits, we could get pretty much the funding
                    we needed. At that point, CU was in the State Department. We had 2 masters. We
                    went to the Office of Cultural Affairs in the State Department for funding for
                    exchange programs and cultural performing arts programs and things like that. We
                    went to USIA for information programs. But USIA got involved on the cultural
                    side with periodicals, contributing to performing arts exhibits. We had a lot
                    going on there. We expanded from 2 American professors of American literature in
                    2 Polish universities to 5 by the time I left. There were no undergraduate
                    exchanges then, but graduate exchanges of students went from 6 when I started to
                    about 40 in several different programs by the time I left. But there was an
                    awful lot of ad hoc private sector exchange going on with students and
                    professors, a tremendous amount of cultural contact, performing arts groups, an
                    awful lot of activity, both planned program and targets of opportunity. We would
                    see an opportunity to get somebody who was in Western Europe and bring them in.
                    By and large, the Poles normally went along with it. We funded everything, of
                    course. So, in a sense, it was to keep the Poles pointed towards America, the
                    future. Later on, after Reagan made his famous speech, we can look back and say
                    what we were doing was undermining the Evil Empire.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the role of the Polish intellectual in Poland?
                        Intellectuals play different roles in each country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: Many of them - probably most of them - were trying to remain as
                    independent of the Polish system as they could, which was a communist system.
                    But a different communist system, from the Soviet system, probably the most open
                    at that time of all of the Warsaw Pact countries. Polish intellectuals saw their
                    role as keeping Polish culture, Polish intellectual pursuit, the Polish academic
                    pursuit, alive during a difficult period. They looked back to the 19th century
                    when this had been done before in Poland. Poland was partitioned between Germany
                    and the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Russia, 3 partitions at the end of the 18th
                    century leading to the disappearance of Poland as a sovereign nation. But during
                    that period, Polish intellectuals, Polish cultural figures, kept the Polish
                    spirit and the Polish culture alive. You have peoplChopin during that period.
                    You had Sienkiewich, who became a Nobel laureate in literature. And many others.
                    They looked historically to the 19th century and were trying to do pretty much
                    the same thing in the 20th century, with some success.</p>

                <p>SCANLAN: We did. It was the second one. The first was the Russian one and the
                    second one was the Polish one. In the case of Poland, it circulated very freely.
                    In Russia, we always had problems. You had to distribute it through their
                    distribution agency and they would return half of them and say they hadn't sold.
                    We never had that problem in Poland. They were extremely popular. Used copies of
                    them would sell in the used bookstores. The American magazine in Poland was very
                    effective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As we worked in cultural affairs, did we see our goal as
                        to talk about America or were we aiming at showing how lousy the Soviet
                        system was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: We saw our role as presenting a positive picture of America, not a
                    negative picture of the Soviet Union. That would have caused us problems with
                    the local authorities. We didn't demean the Soviets.</p>
                <p>One little anecdote on that subject. In October 1964 it was the 20th anniversary
                    of the founding of the Polish People's Republic. During World War II when the
                    Red Army liberated eastern Poland, in a city called Lublin, they found something
                    called the Lublin Committee, which was the precursor to the Polish communist
                    government. They had a 20th anniversary celebration. Khrushchev came to town.
                    All of the communist Warsaw Pact leaders came. I can recall the crowds in front
                    of our embassy. While they were waiting... There were police lines, but they
                    weren't stopping people from coming into our embassy, so a lot of them saw this
                    as an opportunity and they came in asking for copies of “Amerika” magazine. Here
                    was the Russian leader coming by. I got a couple of the local employees and we
                    went down into our storage room and we did have a few hundred copies of back
                    issues of “Amerika” and we brought those out. When they ran out, the guys came
                    to me and said, “What should we do?” I suddenly remembered that we had over
                    2,000 copies of the special issue of “Life Magazine,” an issue relating to the
                    greatness of America, which we hadn't been able to distribute. We got them for
                    practically nothing, 10 cents a copy or something. Then the Poles hadn't
                    permitted us to distribute them because shortly before that “Life” had done an
                    interview with Gomulka that he had not liked. I said, “Go get those 'Life'
                    magazines.” They brought up the 2,000 copies of “Life Magazine” and we were out
                    in front of the embassy distributing them. Here it was, the Poles voting for
                    American magazines and American culture as Khrushchev is coming by. When the
                    little parade came by, he was in a convertible. We had a very modern looking
                    building. He was in the car with Gomulka and you could see him looking at our
                    building and then turn back to Gomulka. I'm sure he said, “What building is
                    that” and Gomulka said, “It's the American embassy.” You see him looking back
                    again sharply. I have that on an 8 millimeter film. We didn't openly attack the
                    Russians. All we did was support all cultural activities that helped the Poles
                    stay in touch with America.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>We had a big English teaching program, too, not directly but in support of Polish
                    English teaching. We brought in all the best linguists we could find and put on
                    special programs and seminars.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Poles also turned out some really first rate

                <p>SCANLAN: Yes.</p>

                    period.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your dealings with the Poles in your field as

                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: In their official capacity, many of them, including some of the
                    academics and people who had official positions in some cultural organization,
                    would be very careful in their official relations with you. But in private, they
                    would let their hair down and tell you what they thought about the Russians and
                    what they thought about communism. There was no dearth ever of anti-Russian
                    jokes. The typical joke in Poland in those days was anti-Russian, not just
                    anti-communism. They belittled the Russians constantly.</p>

                <p>SCANLAN: They were there in a pro-consul relationship. They had a huge embassy.
                    They had a cultural center there. The Poles didn't pay that much attention to
                    it. There was an obligatory year of Russian language training in high schools
                    and colleges, but the Poles didn't pay much attention to that. They went for
                    English. The Soviets had their magazines just like we had ours. One had the
                    impression that they were content to maintain their control at the official
                    level, which they did. I can recall Russian diplomats telling me that the
                    relationship was more party to party. I had conversations with Russian diplomats
                    and would say... I spent a lot of time at the ministry of foreign affairs, the
                    ministry of culture, ministry of higher education working on details of
                    programs, getting approval for them. I remember one specific occasion where I
                    had a rather good conversation with a Russian diplomat. He said somewhat
                    derisorily, “Our relationship is party to party.” We did not have that
                    relationship. We rarely even had any contact with party officials. For the
                    Russians, that's how they exercised their control, party to party and military
                    to military. We had no relationship whatsoever with the military either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we feel about Poland at that time as a Warsaw Pact
                        ally? How dependable was it felt to be?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: Most of us believed that Poland would not be a dependable ally in any
                    offensive action, that in an offensive action the Russians probably would have
                    to just keep an eye on the Poles. In a defensive mode, it might be different.
                    The outcome might be a little different. But even there we felt the Poles were
                    probably the least reliable Warsaw Pact allies. They had the largest army
                    because they were the largest country. And they had a strong military tradition.
                    Particularly after '56... Gomulka sent a lot of the Russians home. Up until '56,
                    most of the senior military control positions in Poland were either Russian
                    officers or Russian Poles, including Marshall Rokossovsky, the famous one.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Ambassador Cabot relate with the Polish
                        authorities?SCANLAN: Cabot was a very traditional diplomat, very correct.
                        His experience had been entirely with the non-communist world up until then.
                        His relationship with Polish authorities was very formal, very correct. He
                        did develop a rather decent relationship with the foreign minister, Adam
                        Rapatski, who spoke excellent French. Cabot didn't speak Polish, but he
                        spoke very good French. Rapatski was one of the few genuine intellectuals in
                        the Polish government. He was pre-war educated. He had been a socialist, not
                        a communist, and when they coopted the entire Socialist Party in the late
                        '40s he was a respected figure, who incidentally later on in August 1968
                        resigned when the Warsaw Pact forces invaded Czechoslovakia. He resigned on
                        that issue. Rapatski under the circumstances was a relatively decent guy.
                        Cabot developed a rather decent official relationship with him and with his
                        deputy, Jozev, who was also a pre-war educated Wieniewicz socialist. He
                        spoke very good English. His relationship was on that level plus the fact
                        that both he and Mrs. Cabot were very interested in art and in music, so he
                        enjoyed very much when we would have a performing arts group and played his
                        role as ceremonial ambassador very well. He did not ever get down very
                        deeply into the political intricacies and complexities of Polish political
                        and social society because he just didn't have the background for it. But he
                        was very good to work for. He would solicit the views of staff. He would
                        accept views. There were occasions when I thought he was a little skeptical
                        about some of the programs that I thought we ought to get involved in, but
                        he would always support you. I enjoyed working for him. He was a Boston
                        Brahmin and at times could be very formal in the old school sense. But a
                        very decent human bring. And Mrs. Cabot was delightful.</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any exchange programs of opera or jazz?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: Yes, we got very much involved in jazz. The Poles had developed some
                    pretty good jazz musicians and the people that we were dealing with in cultural
                    exchanges did not want to acknowledge jazz as anything worthy of cultural
                    attention. In the summer of 1962 there was a major jazz festival in Washington
                    called the Washington Jazz Festival. I leaned very heavily on the people I dealt
                    with particularly at the cultural section of the foreign ministry to agree to
                    let us send a very good Polish jazz combo, 5 of them, to Washington for the
                    festival. They reluctantly agreed. They were led by a very good fellow, Andziej
                    Czoczowski. At any rate, they were good. They came here and some of the officers
                    who had just left Warsaw and were back in the Department arranged for them to
                    give a jazz concert in the courtyard of the State Department. They also were
                    very successful at the jazz festival. After they became a hit, the very people I
                    had been dealing with in the ministry of culture and the ministry of foreign
                    affairs who kind of turned their nose up said, “You see, we have such wonderful
                    people.” From that point on, we developed a very good relationship. There was a
                    very good Polish jazz festival every year. They had a jazz magazine that was
                    very good. We sent a lot of their people to the States. We brought people there.
                    Ella Fitzgerald came under our auspices and put on a very successful concert at
                    their huge congress hall. So, we developed a very good relationship and
                    supported the development of Polish jazz.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In these programs, what was our ultimate objective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: It was defined very well by Ronald Reagan later on. We were undermining
                    the Polish communist system by keeping creative Poles in touch with cultural
                    developments in the United States, keeping them informed. This was the period
                    when the Soviets were trying to keep information out of the Soviet Union and to
                    some extent out of Eastern Europe. They were not that successful with regard to
                    Eastern Europe. They spent more money jamming the Voice of America than we spent
                    broadcasting. You can hear the jammers even in Poland. But Radio Free Europe got
                    through even though the Poles had a jamming program, too. VOA did. We were
                    getting information into Poland and through Poland into the Soviet Union. It was
                    a very successful program in many ways. For instance, we sent so many Polish
                    scholars of sociology to the U.S. in the late '50s and early '60s under a Ford
                    Foundation program and under other programs that we helped develop a very good
                    school of Polish sociology. They put out a quarterly publication on sociology
                    which was excellent. I recall being told by some of these Polish sociologists
                    that their Soviet colleagues told them that they had to learn to read Polish.
                    They could get the Polish quarterlies. They couldn't get the American
                    quarterlies. We had the Cuban Missile Crisis while we were in Poland. Khrushchev
                    was overthrown and ousted in the Soviet Union in October 1964 and replaced by
                    tougher minded people, Brezhnev and Kosygin. We had the beginning of the Vietnam
                    War in February of 1965 and that chilled the atmosphere even in Poland. This was
                    not an easy period of relations. Poland was sort of a window. People have to
                    remember that geographically Poland was the only East European Warsaw Pact
                    country surrounded entirely by other communist Warsaw Pact countries. It had a
                    seacoast, but otherwise its neighbors were all Warsaw Pact communist countries.
                    This wasn't true of any of the other Eastern European countries. And yet Poland
                    was our principal window into the Warsaw Pact for cultural influence and
                    information because of the nature of Polish society and because we had the wit
                    to try and exploit that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think that one of the greatest tasks that you
                        might have been faced with was the death of President Kennedy. Were you
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>SCANLAN: Yes. John Steinbeck was there at the time. He had been at that famous
                    dinner at the White House with all the Nobel laureates where Kennedy said this
                    was the greatest collection of wisdom at dinner since Thomas Jefferson dined
                    alone. In any case, Steinbeck on that occasion was approached by Kennedy to go
                    to Eastern Europe. He went to 3 countries, Yugoslavia also. I had been his
                    escort in Poland most of the time including the day that Kennedy was shot. We
                    went down to Lodz. He had been in western Poland, where he had been taken care
                    of by our Poznan consulate staff. Then they delivered him to Lodz, the second
                    largest city in Poland. There was a university there and he was going to speak
                    to the American literature program students. We were there with him for that.
                    They gave a dinner for him. Then we drove him back to Warsaw. He was with his
                    wife, Elaine, and we were in my car. My wife was there. He was kind of tired. He
                    had been in Poland for a week and had had programs every day. He didn't want to
                    do anything that evening. We said, “Would you like to come back to our house and
                    have just a simple spaghetti dinner?” He said, “That would be wonderful. I've
                    had all this heavy Polish food.” So we had a nice, quick spaghetti dinner at our
                    house. Then I took him to his hotel. I dropped by the embassy then because I had
                    been gone all day. It was about 8:00 PM. I walked into the embassy and went back
                    to the press and culture section and saw the press officer, Phil Arnold, working
                    with the ticker. He said, “Jack, President Kennedy's been shot.” We didn't have
                    rapid communications in those days. So, we were getting a report on VOA. I said,
                    “I'd better tell Steinbeck.” I called the hotel and the maid on their floor had
                    just told them but they had nothing further. So, I said, “Well, I'll come by and
                    bring a portable radio.” “Yes, please do that. I'm very concerned.” So, I
                    dropped by my home first to tell my wife what was going on. While I was home
                    briefly, the desk officer, the second or third guy on the Polish American desk
                    in the foreign ministry, came to my door to express his condolences and his
                    personal grief. This guy was a communist official from the foreign ministry, a
                    very nice guy. Unfortunately, he died fairly young, Andzey Wojtowicz. He was
                    later posted in Washington and was quite popular here as a Polish diplomat. That
                    was the nature of the society. The Poles took this almost as a personal loss.
                    So, I went back to the hotel. Steinbeck was in his pyjamas and bathrobe and
                    Elaine was there, very upset by this. We didn't know what had happened, who had
                    shot him. It was a horrible feeling. We were cut off from the world, listening
                    on VOA and static and what have you. We were getting the reports. Elaine was
                    from Texas and was a personal friend of John Commely, who was also shot. They
                    had been in Texas just before coming on this trip and had heard all of this
                    violently anti-Kennedy stuff from some of the wealthy Texans. I think Steinbeck
                    at that point was almost prepared to believe that this could have been a plot by
                    some of these violently anti-Kennedy Texans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When I first heard this, this was my reaction.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: That they were wildly fanatically conservative anti-Kennedy people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Particularly in Dallas.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>SCANLAN: Yes.</p>
                <p>Anyway, he was very upset. Then he said, “Well, please cancel all social events,
                    but I will go forward with the official program. He would have wanted me to do
                    this. I came at his request and I will finish that part.” He had a meeting the
                    following morning. He was to speak to university students. We expected an
                    audience of well over 100 students of English. This was a major field. We kept
                    listening to the radio until almost midnight and then as I left, he said, “On
                    your way to pick me up for that meeting at the university, would you see if you
                    could get me a black armband?” Well, it wasn't exactly a free society. But there
                    were private shops. He was to be at the university at 10:00. The next morning,
                    I'm down on a street of private shops looking for a black tie for myself and a
                    black armband for him. I found a little tailor shop and told the tailor who I
                    was and what I wanted. He made a black armband for me very quickly. I took it
                    back and gave it to John. He wore it and we both wore the black ties. He spoke
                    to the students, a very hushed audience, at the university. There were more
                    people there than I expected, almost 200. I think they went way beyond the
                    English faculty. That was the way we experienced Kennedy's death.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Belgrade, we were-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: It was not only large but a very sympathetic audience. The Poles in
                    general behaved in a very sympathetic manner. They had a memorial mass at the
                    cathedral which the entire embassy staff attended. We had a picture display out
                    in front of the embassy and they just came by the hundreds and put candles in
                    front of the pictures.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a very emotional time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Why don't we stop at this point? Before we leave the '64/'65 period, let's talk
                    about the crackdown, when things started getting tougher, and how that affected
                    your work as a cultural attach�. Also for the time that you were in charge of
                    the political section.</p>
                <p>SCANLAN: Okay. That didn't start... It was an incremental tightening of the
                    internal political situation in Poland. But the real crackdown... I'm not sure
                    I'd call it a “crackdown.” It didn't take that form. Up until the end of the
                    Gomulka era, it was a steady tightening. He who had been the hero of October '56
                    by the time he was ousted by Gierek in December of '71, he had few faithful
                    followers and had lost all the credibility.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Next time, we will talk about the effects of the gradual
                        process during the time you were there and also what you were getting from
                        the country team and from your own views about Gomulka, and then about your
                        time as political counselor, how the political section operated in this
                        difficult environment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: The people who were fighting this tightening of the internal political
                    situation were on the cultural side, the intellectuals. The writers union was
                    one of the main battle groups during the mid-'60s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also with the Catholic Church and its role in this at that
                        time. And any reflections on Polish anti-Semitism that you saw.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCANLAN: Yes, we should talk about Bobby Kennedy's visit in June of 1964 and the
                    role of Cardinal Wyszynski, who played a major political role in Poland.</p>
