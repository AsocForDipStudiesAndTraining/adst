                <p>THOMAS J. DUNNIGAN</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: September 7, 1990</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tom and I are old friends, going back many years. Tom, I
                        wonder if you could give me an idea of your background; where you came from
                        before you got into this peculiar trade of foreign affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Well, I was born and raised in Ohio, Stu, and went to college at John
                    Carroll University, a small school in Cleveland—not so small now, it was small
                    then when I went. And immediately upon graduation, which was during World War
                    II, I went into the Army. While I was serving in the Army...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in the Army?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: I was running a food supply unit for a replacement battalion of about a
                    thousand men in France during most of the war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A repo-depot, as they called it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: I was in the 16th Repo-depot, I remember it well. Toward end of the war
                    I was still in France, and it must have been in the early summer of '45, an
                    announcement appeared in the Stars and Stripes that a Foreign Service exam would
                    be given for the first time since 1941, and that members of the armed forces
                    were eligible to take it if they had certain credentials: American citizenship
                    of twenty-one years, college graduate and so forth. But they also had to have
                    their company commander's permission and so forth. Well, I thought this would be
                    very interesting since I'd majored in history in college, and I applied. And lo
                    and behold, I was approved to take the exam, and took it with several thousand
                    others in the fall of '45, in Oberammergau, Germany, inside a huge mountain that
                    had been carved out as the Messerschmitt fighter plane plant but was perfectly
                    suited to give Foreign Service exams to several thousand students.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>Having taken that, I was discharged from the Army about six months later,
                    returned to Ohio, and received notice that I should report to Chicago for an
                    oral examination. I reported to Chicago and took the oral examination sometime
                    in May of '46, before a board, one of whose members was a serving general in the
                    Army. Another public member I recall was from the Department of Agriculture.
                    There were several retired Foreign Service types, including an ambassador. I was
                    told at the conclusion of that day that I had passed the exam. I thanked the
                    chairman and then asked him how long would it be before I was called to duty,
                    because I had been accepted at Harvard graduate school and I wanted to continue
                    my studies for a while. He said, “No fear, it'll be at least two years. We're
                    backed-up with candidates.”</p>
                <p>This was my first experience with government. Because I'd been at Harvard about
                    six weeks and I received a telegram to report within three weeks to Washington
                    to begin my Foreign Service career.</p>
                <p>So that was, roughly, my background.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have what amounted to an entering class?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: We did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe a bit who these were and what kind of
                        training you had?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Classes were entering during that summer of 1946, because the service
                    was trying to expand rapidly, every two weeks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good God!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: We were given a six-weeks training, but the classes kept rolling. My
                    class entered the 30th of July in '46, and we were fifteen students, all of
                    whom, with one exception, had been in the armed forces. The one exception was a
                    woman who had been in the Foreign Service, Kay Bracken, and she went through
                    with our class. The others, all of whom are now of course retired and some of
                    whom are dead, were people with whom one kept in touch over the years and so
                    forth, and I see them very occasionally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, could you give a little idea of how you and maybe
                        your colleagues viewed what you were going to do in the world, and the
                        United States' position in it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: I think few of us had much of an idea at that time. Perhaps some did
                    who had majored in international relations and had looked forward to a Foreign
                    Service career, but most of us hadn't. We were very interested in finding out
                    what we were going to be doing.</p>
                <p>The training in those days left, to put it charitably, a great deal to be
                    desired. I remember we had one solid week, in the afternoons, of lectures by an
                    old civil servant from the Visa Office about visas. And I remember remarking to
                    one of my colleagues at the end of one of those lectures that I wasn't sure this
                    was a career I was interested in. Because the entire lecture was filled with
                    “Thou shalt not,” and “If you make a mistake, the government will never forgive
                    you,” and “That money's entrusted to you, and the GAO will pursue you to the end
                    of the world to get you if you misappropriate fifteen dollars, or miscertify it,
                    or whatever.” There was a great deal of that at the time. We then had several
                    lengthy lectures about protocol and how to behave and how to drop cards and the
                    usual sort of thing. Nothing, that I recall, whatsoever about political or
                    economic reporting. It was geared almost entirely to consular and to
                    administrative work, it seemed to me at the time.</p>
                <p>Interestingly enough, the Foreign Service Institute was then located in Lothrop
                    House, where Connecticut and Columbia Roads come together, which is now, I'm
                    told, the Russian Purchasing Mission. But we sat there in air-conditioned
                    splendor during that summer of '46, absorbing all this.</p>
                <p>Assignments were given out toward the end of the course, and we scattered from
                    Berlin to Shanghai, Saigon, and other places like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Berlin from '46 to 1950. What were you doing
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: I did many things. There was no administrative officer in those days at
                    post, at least not in Berlin. I was assigned to the Office of the United States
                    Political Advisor, Robert Murphy, which was our State Department presence. There
                    was a very large office, larger than most embassies. The administrative work,
                    including supervision of the personnel, was done by the political counselor,
                    Warren Chase, in his off hours. He did have a personnel staff of three young
                    ladies under him, but he made all the big decisions. And I was assigned there
                    fully expecting to be a consular officer and apply what little I remembered
                    about visa lore and the Act of 1921 to applicants.</p>
                <p>But I'd been there about a week, and Mr. Chase called me to his office one night
                    and he said, “Dunnigan, it says here you're supposed to go over and work in the
                    consular unit.”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Yes.”</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>And he said, “Well, we've just sent a vice counselor over there about a month
                    ago. They don't need any more help. You stay here.”</p>
                <p>Young and pliable, I said, “Yes sir. What shall I do?”</p>
                <p>Well, he said, “You know, this office has been established now for over two
                    years. It was founded in London by Mr. Murphy back in '44, and it's accumulated
                    a great deal of history in its files. Now those files need clearing out. I want
                    you to start weeding them out.”</p>
                <p>This sounded like a thankless task, but actually it proved to be a boon to me
                    because I was able to read through the old files and find out the whole history
                    of the Office of the Political Advisor's relationship to the military, and read
                    fascinating reports about our officers who'd been into concentration camps
                    immediately upon their liberation, and relations with the Russians in the early
                    days and so forth, which gave me a tremendous background to be in Berlin.</p>
                <p>Well, after six weeks or so of that, perhaps a little longer, I was assigned to a
                    unit that of course wouldn't exist now, it was called the German War Documents
                    Unit. What we really did, we did two things: we helped pursue and extradite
                    Nazis who had fled abroad to Spain, to Argentina, to other countries; and we
                    were liaison with historians who were working in the German war documents.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This became the Berlin Document Center.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: It was the Berlin Document Center in its beginning, yes. There were
                    three or four American historians there, and we were liaison with them. When
                    they had to get things, we would get them for them, help them with requests that
                    required government help and so forth. And in return they let us see various
                    nuggets of information and so forth.</p>
                <p>Now that was interesting and I did that for a year, at the end of which the full
                    panoply of administrative services was invented for the Foreign Service. It
                    appeared, and we got our first administrative officer. Well, he required a
                    general services officer, so they look around for a junior officer, and I was
                    appointed general services officer. Which I found a little less interesting but
                    nonetheless challenging, because I found out how prickly people can be about
                    certain perquisites and office space and schedules in communications centers and
                    things like this, and use of automobiles and, oh, various other things, and
                    residences, although we didn't have to worry too much about residences because
                    they were assigned usually by the military to us. That went on for awhile.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>Our admin officer was a fine old gentlemen of British extraction who had been a
                    prisoner of war in Singapore in the British Army and had become an American
                    after the war, naturalized, and showed up as our admin officer in Berlin. I
                    don't think one could regard him as a great success as an admin officer,
                    although he was a very fine man and we all liked him, but he was still
                    psychologically unrecovered from his four years in a Japanese prison camp.</p>
                <p>So after about nine months of doing that, I was given my first job in political
                    reporting. I was assigned to follow developments in eastern Germany, in what we
                    called the Soviet Zone of Occupation at that time. And this was fascinating.
                    This was when the East Germans were founding what they called, euphemistically,
                    the People's Police, but which was really an army, officered by former high Nazi
                    officials. We got information from this that allowed us to complain to the
                    Russians, but they pooh-poohed this, of course, saying it was merely a
                    strengthening of the local police and so forth, although we had tangible
                    evidence of military units parading, drilling and so forth. And this became
                    worrisome.</p>
                <p>And also reporting on developments within East Germany. Now occasionally in those
                    days German politicians could come out from the zone, come to West Berlin, and
                    talk to us, which was of course long before the Wall. And they often did so at
                    their own risk. But they would, they wanted to talk, and so we got some very
                    interesting stories about conditions in Saxony or in Rostock or wherever. The
                    clergy were good that way, some of the university people, and politicians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were these people that were coming disturbed at what was
                        happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Yes, they were definitely disturbed, because they felt powerless. They
                    said all control is exercised by the SED, the German Communist Party in East
                    Germany. And while they belonged generally to either the old Christian
                    Democratic Party, which had existed there in '45, '46 and still existed in the
                    shadow, or the Liberal Democratic Party, they were merely tolerated. They had no
                    authority, no power; everything was done by the Communists. The only way to get
                    ahead in East Germany was to be a member of the SED.</p>
                <p>I came on home leave in the summer of '49, got married, went back to Berlin, and
                    picked up again on this work on East Germany. And this was a fascinating period,
                    because it was at that time that the German Democratic Republic was established,
                    in October of '49. We saw signs of that coming by reading the papers from the
                    Soviet zone, which would contain reports of slogans adopted by factories,
                    saying: “We must have our own government. If they have one in Bonn, why can't we
                    have one?” One began to wonder why this was being orchestrated all over the zone
                    at the same time. And it was quite clear that they were preparing a move, which
                    they did on the 7th of October of that year.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>It was just at that time, too, that the East German problem was looming so large
                    in our calculations that we established a separate unit to follow East Germany,
                    headed at first by George Morgan and including several other officers. Well, I
                    worked with them for a while, then I was detached from that, because that group
                    took over all the reporting in East Germany. Where it had been one person, say,
                    the year before, it was now three at least. In fact, it soon was four or
                    five.</p>
                <p>I was assigned to a different responsibility, and that was to represent the US on
                    what was called the Civil Administration Committee of the Berlin Command de
                    Tour, the group that ran the city. Ostensibly four-power, but by the time I got
                    on it the Russians had been out for over a year, so it was basically French,
                    British, and American. And we reported to the commandants. The Civil
                    Administration Committee handled all of the basic details of running the city.
                    The German authorities would report to us, ask our permission to do things. We
                    would give it, usually, if it were sensible; otherwise we would explain why it
                    wasn't possible. Many of the things had to do with legal matters, going back to
                    German law, so we had a legal subcommittee. We had a labor subcommittee, because
                    we had to look after labor affairs and various things. This was a fascinating
                    job, and I did that for the last year I was in Berlin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did the blockade come?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: The blockade started on the 24th of June 1948, and lasted until the
                    12th of May '49.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Prior to the blockade, were you and the others around you
                        concerned that something might happen? How did you feel about being in
                        Berlin and inside this area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: We maintained, outwardly, that Berlin was a four-power city and that
                    we, as a member of the occupying powers, could go anywhere we wanted within the
                    city. We could not go outside the city into the Soviet zone except on one road
                    that linked us to the West. That was the autobahn that went...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Through Helmstedt?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Helmstedt, that's right. And there was a train line. We could go by
                    train either to Frankfurt or to Bremerhaven, but we could not go outside the
                    city in any other direction. But we deliberately went into the Soviet sector of
                    Berlin, as it was called, frequently. In fact, they had the best opera there.
                    And we would drive around, just to be seen, in American cars and so forth. We
                    didn't want the Russians to say they had sort of shut us out of there, or
                    frightened us out. And in those days you could take the subway or the elevated
                    train across. There was no problem, just right in the city.</p>
                <p>Now it began to get a little dicey in April of '48. The Russians had walked out
                    of the Control Council, the main governing body for governing Germany. Marshal
                    Sadolovsky had walked out at the end of March '48 over a dispute, as I recall,
                    about currency reform, because the Russians didn't want any. The Western powers
                    had said, “Look, nothing will ever get this country off its back unless they
                    have a solid currency.” Well, there was a to-do about that, and Sadolovsky
                    walked out and never came back.</p>
                <p>Then about four weeks later a British plane coming into Berlin was, as I recall,
                    shot down by the Russians, who said it had strayed out of the air corridor
                    (which was nonsense) and crashed. And this told us they were ready to play
                    hardball. They stopped the trains from Helmstedt around that period, on the
                    pretext that the bridge across the River Elbe needed repair and would be closed
                    for some time. So the noose was tightening. We still had the autobahn to drive
                    back and forth; but they could have at any time said the autobahn bridge needed
                    repair.</p>
                <p>I think it was on the 21st of June that we declared currency reform for West
                    Germany and West Berlin. The Russians then declared a blockade on the 24th, and
                    we started the airlift on the 26th.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling there? Did you think we were going to
                        make it when this started?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: We didn't know. We didn't know how long it would last. We kept getting
                    reports from Ambassador Bedell Smith in Moscow. He'd have conversations,
                    including those with Stalin, about this, and Stalin would sort of grunt or nod
                    and say, yes, he thought something could be worked out, but, you know, it never
                    was.</p>
                <p>Dependents who were there (and I didn't have any at that time) were offered an
                    opportunity to leave. And very few left; most wanted to stay. They wanted to
                    ride it out and not leave the Russians with the feeling they'd forced us
                    out.</p>
                <p>The situation didn't get questionable until the fall. The airlift worked fairly
                    well in the early months, and there had been enough supplies there to last, but
                    it soon became evident that the two great needs over the winter were going to be
                    coal and potatoes. So the planes began to bring those in.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>We started out using C-47s. While they were state of the art in some ways in
                    those days, they weren't very big.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, they were two-engined planes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Later, within a few months, we began to get C-54s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was a four-engined, bigger plane.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Yes. General Tunnel, a lieutenant general in the Air Force who was
                    brought from the States and put in charge of the airlift, commandeered almost
                    every C-54 in the world and brought it to Frankfurt. So, with the C-54s, they
                    could bring a lot more in. Still, you were going to feed a city of two and a
                    half million people, and it wasn't at all sure whether we could make it through
                    the winter.</p>
                <p>The worst time of all came in November, because, for about ten days in a row,
                    there was heavy fog and planes couldn't get in. We didn't have the sophisticated
                    radar or landing-guidance equipment we have now; it was very primitive. And
                    also, most of the time, we were using Tempelhof Airport, which is right in the
                    city of Berlin and wasn't really built for very large planes. It took some
                    skill. Later, we built a new airport with the French and the British, Tegel
                    Airport, a much larger airport. But that wasn't completed until February or
                    March. So, in November, we were still using Tempelhof, in our sector, and Gatau,
                    a smaller airport, in the British sector, and the British were bringing in their
                    share of mat�riel, too. Now the feeling was that if that fog had persisted for
                    another month or so, we might have been done in.</p>
                <p>But, fortunately, after about ten days, it lifted enough for the planes to start
                    getting back in. And it was amazing to see them come and go...land, unload, and
                    be gone in ninety seconds—incredible!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did this do to our relations with the Germans during
                        this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: It certainly solidified the relations with the Germans in Berlin,
                    because there was a feeling: We're all in this together. Now we, as occupiers,
                    lived much better than they did. We still were getting PX supplies, although
                    when electricity went off, as it did, we didn't have any electricity, things of
                    that nature. We were given five gallons, as I recall, of gasoline a month for
                    our cars, so everybody was car-pooling when they used a car in those days. I had
                    a bicycle along with my car, and I used that a great deal during the blockade.
                    It got to be a stick-it-out thing, everybody saying, “By God, we're just not
                    going to let them do this to us!” And we did it.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel a military threat?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Well, we were always aware that it was there. The Russians, in my
                    recollection, never particularly threatened that. They didn't threaten to come
                    in. There didn't seem to be any large movement of their forces that would
                    indicate they were planning something. All three powers had garrisons in Berlin,
                    small, they would have been overrun, but it would have been a pretty stiff fight
                    for a few days. And the Germans would have sabotaged everything the Russians did
                    anyhow; they hated them at the time.</p>
                <p>No, it solidified our relations with the West Germans. Because, for instance, in
                    the airlift, all of the manual labor was being done by Germans at the airport,
                    unloading that coal, unloading the potatoes, telling the plane when it could
                    move out again. All of that was done by them, and pretty soon the spirit of
                    cooperation replaced that of sort of occupier-occupied. It was very good in that
                    respect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about, during this time, your contacts with the
                        Soviets and going into the Soviet zone and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: We still went into the Soviet sector. They never stopped us. They had
                    thrown the city government of all Berlin out of East Berlin, but we wouldn't let
                    them stop us going there. Although, just because of the lack of gasoline, we
                    probably never went there as often. We could go by subway, though—when the
                    subway worked, but, again, you had power shortages.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, in this blockade, were the East Germans living
                        better than the West Germans in Berlin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: The East Germans, of course, were not directly affected by the
                    blockade. Their level had been perhaps close to that of the West Berliners
                    before the blockade—bad for both of them really.</p>
                <p>But with the introduction of the new currency reform in West Berlin, prices meant
                    something. Items began to have value again. West Germans had things that East
                    Germans could only admire. So gradually, gradually there became a cleft between
                    the two that grew wider over the years and ended, as we know now, with tearing
                    the Wall down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feel for how Robert Murphy ran his shop,
                        or was he too far away?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Well, yes and no. He worked, of course, extremely closely with General
                    Clay, who was the military governor, and he was a most kind and considerate
                    chief to the junior officers. As I recall, he did not hold staff meetings that
                    included everybody, but we would hear from others what he wanted, and things
                    like this. No, I'm a great admirer of his, and I think he did a splendid job
                    there. We know, because I could read the telegrams, that he was cautioning
                    firmness in regard to the blockade. General Clay, of course, had wanted us to
                    send an armored unit up the autobahn to shoot our way in when the Russians
                    stopped our land transit. Murphy seemed to go along with that, but I don't think
                    he was completely sold on the idea, because he realized the dangers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we didn't have much of a military in those
                        days.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Well, the truth of the matter is, we had little military. We had gutted
                    this wonderful force we'd had in '45. We had occupation troops there. Most of
                    the combat troops had long since been discharged from the Army. We had a force
                    that was called a constabulary in West Germany, and it wasn't until the Korean
                    War, a year after the end of the blockade, that we began to build up our forces
                    again. No, Clay and Murphy were well aware of our weakness in that regard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you then left and you went to London. You were there
                        from '50 to '54. What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: My time in London was split into two periods. The first two and a half
                    years, I was in the political section. I was reporting on German and Austrian
                    affairs, which were very important because, of course, the British were
                    associates with us in the occupation of both those countries, and we were trying
                    to write an Austrian peace treaty at the time, and there were negotiations on
                    Germany, what to do with it. The Bonn Republic had just come into existence and
                    so forth. Also, my other job was helping report on the Liberal and Conservative
                    parties in Britain. I worked under Bill Tremble in both those, who was our first
                    secretary at the time there.</p>
                <p>Then, at the change of administration when Eisenhower took over from Truman, we
                    sent a new ambassador, Winthrop Aldrich, and I was made his staff aide. So my
                    last nearly two years was spent as staff aide to the ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then go back to the first part. How did you work with your
                        British colleagues on Austrian and German policies?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Extremely closely. We were down there with them almost every day in the
                    Foreign Office, going over our mutual messages, you know, saying that Washington
                    thinks we should do this, and they'd say, yes, we can do this and that, but we
                    couldn't go that far. Usually they were holding us back a little bit, it seemed
                    to me. But they were friendly. They had outstanding leadership from Frank
                    Roberts, who, I guess, would be the equivalent of something like an Under
                    Secretary for German affairs. They elevated that position to a very high one.
                    And Dennis Allen and Pat Roberts, both of whom became outstanding British
                    ambassadors later, headed in sequence the German section there. And we worked
                    very closely with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a divergence in feelings? I mean, the British,
                        of course, had been fighting the Germans for a long time. We came in some
                        time afterwards, and maybe we were more inclined to forgive and forget. Was
                        this a problem or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: It was absolutely a problem. You're absolutely right, they had a
                    different outlook. They really didn't like Germans. And most Americans who spent
                    any time in Germany did, in my experience. But the British just did not like
                    them. And the Germans sensed this; they knew right away to play off the
                    Americans against the British.</p>
                <p>I'll tell you a little story. Once, in Berlin, one of our very senior officers,
                    who later became an ambassador in many countries, after having come back from a
                    Control Council meeting where all four of the powers had sat, had a gin and
                    tonic, and then he threw the ice out and said, “We may be the dumbest people in
                    the world, but the British are the most stupid.” Now this was in relation to a
                    move they made supporting the Russians that he felt was crazy, but I just add
                    that as an indication of the reaction you would get from certain people.</p>
                <p>I saw this frequently in the houses of Parliament, because I went down there to
                    follow all the German and Austrian debates, there was a gut, almost vitriolic,
                    anti-German feeling, particularly on the Labour benches.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that's surprising.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Yes. Less so on the Liberals, and the Conservatives were generally less
                    inclined certainly than Labour to take that attitude. No, you couldn't be there
                    long without noticing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this because of the war, or do you think this went
                        farther back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: I think it went back to at least World War I and the tremendous
                    slaughter of British manhood then and the behavior of the kaiser that grew up.
                    They felt he let the side down.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, Queen Victoria's grandson.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Exactly. No, it went back to at least World War I, but of course what
                    happened in World War II exacerbated it. Now it was a little ameliorated on the
                    Conservative side because so many of them had been, I guess, “caught out.” In
                    the '30s they had been all for appeasing Hitler and the Germans, and it was only
                    Churchill's fortitude and persistence that brought Britain to where it was,
                    where they finally began to re-arm and so forth. So, many of the Conservatives
                    were not in much of a position to take a very loud stance, but the Labour people
                    did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you say our embassy was more comfortable with the
                        Conservatives than with Labour?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Indeed. I think there's little question about that. We had an excellent
                    man who blazed the way, before my time, with the Labour Party. He was the only
                    man in 1945 who had any Labour contacts, a man named Sam Burger. And Sam was
                    widely regarded by the Labour people even when I got there, and he'd departed
                    some time before that. He was followed, the torch was picked up, by Dave
                    Linebaugh and Wanda Zengotita in my time, and they had close links with the
                    Labour Party. But we had a large political section, a large economic section,
                    and there was no question in my mind they were much comfortable with the
                    Conservative people. They were more like them, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also, there is an ideology in the Labour Party that we
                        just don't have in the United States. I mean, you could be union, but that's
                        a nuts and bolts thing, it has nothing to do with: “It's us against them,”
                        because we all hope to be “them” at some point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: And we don't go around singing “The Red Flag,” you know, and things
                    like this, which they do, and did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any particular issues where you found that we
                        and the British were dealing with German and Austrian affairs where we
                        really were having a hard time resolving?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Yes, of course. This was the period when NATO was building, and we were
                    involved in Korea. And we felt strongly that there had to be a German defense
                    contribution. This was first stated by Secretary Acheson, I believe, in the
                    summer of 1950. And it horrified the British. And it horrified the French to an
                    extent, too. And it horrified some Germans... But we persisted and said, “Look,
                    we cannot bear this entire burden of defending everything by ourselves,
                    particularly since it's Germany we're going to defend in Europe. And we think
                    that these people must contribute to their own defense.” Well, Chancellor
                    Adenauer was chary of that at first, but he agreed finally that they could do
                    so. And then the British were distressed, they were torn. They could see the
                    logic of our position, but their intestinal feeling was that this was a bad
                    thing to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this at your level, too, the people that you were
                        dealing with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Oh, yes. You'd go out and speak to groups, I booked several Labour
                    groups, and there was no question about it that they didn't care for the idea of
                    putting guns back in Jerry's hands again—they're just too good at it, you know,
                    and so forth.</p>
                <p>So that was one of the big issues while I was there, the whole question of how to
                    arrange a German defense contribution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we feel in the embassy? I mean, I'm talking about
                        at your level and the people. Were there problems there, or was this: “Well,
                        what the hell, we've got to do it.”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: I felt that we had to do it. I'd served in Germany, I'd been in Berlin
                    during the blockade, and I guess I saw things more in black and white. And I
                    felt it was necessary that we got some help there. I didn't like the idea, I'll
                    say that. If it could have been done any other way, I would have felt much
                    better. But the more I thought about it and the more I read about it and the
                    more I heard, the more I came around to believing that we had to go that route.
                    There were others in the embassy who never really accepted it, I know that. They
                    weren't directly involved; you would hear this in cafeteria conversations and
                    cocktail party conversations and so forth.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>But an agreement was finally worked out. We went through the tortuous period, of
                    course. I was no longer working with German Affairs, but I was still in London
                    trying to set up this European Defense Community that was torpedoed at the last
                    moment by the French Parliament in their pique about Indochina. Now this left
                    everything up in the air, because we'd put all our marbles behind that. We'd
                    been sold on that idea by the French. I remember a long series of telegrams in
                    the summer of '51 from David Bruce—telegrams that were very well done, drafted,
                    I know, by Martin Herz, most of them—explaining why the French felt it was
                    necessary that there was a German contribution and it had to be part of European
                    units, no separate German divisions and things of this nature. Well, the US
                    bought this and we pushed it, and that was shot down in flames by the French
                    themselves later.</p>
                <p>Now, after I left London, to just finish the story, this was brought to a
                    conclusion by Anthony Eden in one of his finest hours. He was foreign minister
                    in the last Churchill government, and he flew around Europe on a whirlwind tour
                    and persuaded the others that there had to be a German contribution, and it had
                    to come through NATO, and that certain safeguards could be set up through the
                    Western European Union and so forth.</p>
                <p>That was the way it was finally arranged. West Germany, the Federal Republic, was
                    given its sovereignty. The end of the occupation came on the 5th of May, '55. At
                    the same time, Germany was accepted into NATO. It was all part of the deal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, at your level, this was a major bone of contention,
                        too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: It was a bone of contention. A major one? Yes, I would think so,
                    although, as I say, Korea was on everybody's minds in those days.</p>
                <p>Now the Austrian side, we were negotiating the Austrian peace treaty. I would go
                    to a meeting or two on that. I was not the negotiator, of course, Ambassador
                    Llewellyn Thompson was. But he had help from Red Dowling and Francis Williams,
                    who had come over, and we worked closely with them. The issues there were
                    involved. The Trieste question came up then. The Austrian treaty was taken care
                    of, but Trieste was another issue then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were in Britain, they were going through a very
                        difficult economic time, weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: It was bad.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this must have been kind of hard, wasn't it, to be
                        from the United States where things were going very nicely, thank you, in
                        way, and to see Britain really going through the equivalent of wartime
                        rationing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Yes, they were. And, in fact, the rationing was worse than wartime.
                    When we got to London, we, along with the British, got eight-penny-worth of meat
                    a week. Now that isn't much meat, even though prices were far lower then. And
                    various other commodities were rationed. For instance, even though we were at
                    the embassy, we could not buy Scotch whiskey. We could import bourbon, but we
                    could not buy Scotch whiskey. It was all going for export in those years. Little
                    things like that.</p>
                <p>It was the last year of the Attlee administration, the first Labour government
                    after the war, and it had run out of steam, it had run out of ideas. And they
                    were beginning to squabble amongst themselves about the costs of the free health
                    service and so forth. All that was mounting up.</p>
                <p>It's true, Britain had not made its comeback. It was only beginning. The last
                    couple of years we were there, things began to get a little better.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tom, you were the ambassador's aide, to whom?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Winthrop Aldrich.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if you could characterize him. I don't know the
                        gentleman, but, you know, it looks like you just look at his name and you
                        say, oh, my God, another one of these rich guys who paid his way into the
                        Court of Saint James. How was he as an ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: That's an interesting question. He was a formidable person. A blueblood
                    of the bluest. A nephew of the Rockefellers and the uncle of Nelson Rockefeller,
                    David Rockefeller and so forth. He'd been chairman of the board of the Chase
                    Bank before he came over. It wasn't Chase Manhattan at the time, it was just the
                    Chase Bank. He had been a well-known yachtsman. He'd been a naval officer in
                    World War I. A Harvard graduate of the Class of 1905. Married a wealthy woman,
                    Harriet, in New York. Was very big in New York and Newport society. A great
                    contributor to the Republican Party. And extremely Anglophile. Before the war,
                    he'd entertained the Prince of Wales and others. He knew them all. He knew all
                    of the figures of that generation. And the British were pleased to have him,
                    because they knew, when he was nominated, that he was an Anglophile. Now, at
                    that time, Mr. Aldrich was about 68 when he arrived, so he was not a young man,
                    but he was distinguished looking. He worked on the big problems and understood
                    them. We had a magnificent DCM in Julius Holmes, who could run the embassy like
                    a smooth machine, and did run it, and took much of the load off the ambassador.
                    But when there was something to be taken up with the prime minister or the
                    foreign minister, Winthrop Aldrich would do it. And he'd do it well. He had
                    their confidence. And he was well-connected socially in Britain. He knew every
                    duke and duchess and many of the earls and so forth in the UK. He lived well,
                    entertained well. He was responsible for getting the present residence, Winfield
                    House, released by the US Air Force, which was using it as an officers' club.
                    The Air Force turned down his request, so he merely wrote a letter to his good
                    friend Harold Talbot, the secretary of the Air Force. Within a month, the deed
                    had been done. So he did many things.</p>
                <p>I think one of his finest hours in my time came during the Iranian oil crisis and
                    Mossadegh. You know, after Anglo-Iranian had been nationalized in '51, the shah
                    had flown and Mossadegh had taken over. Our business interests were heavily
                    affected there. And the British were distressed by this, so we worked closely
                    with them. Herbert Hoover, Jr., an oil man, was sent over and spent some months
                    with us there, working only on that problem, working with the British, working
                    with the embassy. (A very fine gentleman, I will add, I liked him a lot.)</p>
                <p>But nothing could get done. The Iranians were playing their tricks on us. And I
                    well remember one day, it must have been in the mid-summer of '53, Mr. Aldrich
                    and Hoover and, I believe, Evan Wilson, who was then our Middle East expert in
                    London, met, and somebody else from Washington was there. And Aldrich came out
                    with his jaw set and he said, “We've got to settle this thing. I'm going down to
                    see Eden.” So he went down to see Eden, and that was the beginning of the end.
                    The British caved-in on certain points. We said, “You've got to, because this is
                    going too far. It's hurting both our countries much too much.” And we got a
                    settlement. And the shah was back within a few months.</p>
                <p>I don't know the inner details of that, and I don't know if the book has ever
                    been written about it, because it was very closely held at the time.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, again, you know, looking at this thing, career or
                        non-career, sometimes a man with the credentials such as Aldrich can talk in
                        ways that somebody who just does not have those connections...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Could never have done. Could never have done. And that's why I don't
                    resent our sending non-career people to posts like London. I think there can be
                    utility. Now you get somebody who is a hybrid, like David Bruce, who's been
                    both, then, of course, you're in the best of both worlds.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: It was, in a sense. And I had a well-placed friend here in the
                    department who, when I was back here in training getting ready to go, said,
                    “Don't be ridiculous. Don't do that, I'll get you a job here in the
                    department.”</p>
                <p>I said, “No. I want to go see what consular work is like. I haven't done it yet.
                    I haven't been to the Far East, and I'm going to do it.”</p>
                <p>Well, he gave me a look as though he thought I were off my rocker. Because he'd
                    seen Manila, he'd been out there in the consulates and come back and said, “What
                    a hole...”</p>
                <p>But I went out there, and I was given the visa section under a consul general of
                    the very old school, Hayward Hill.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who only just recently deceased. He was for years in
                        Athens. I remember him living in Athens.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: And, as you know, his bequest of almost a million dollars to DACOR took
                    everyone's breath away. He was that sort of man, generous to a fault, but not a
                    tower of strength on consular matters, if I can put it charitably.</p>
                <p>Anyhow, the visa section there consisted of myself, Jim Mason as vice consul, and
                    two American consular assistants. And we had a tremendous load of visas,
                    because, as you know, the Philippines is one of our problem areas, and we were
                    going from morning till night. It was interesting, I must say.</p>
                <p>My wife said to me, after I'd been in Manila and Hong Kong, she said, “You know,
                    I wish you'd go back there, because you always came home with the most
                    interesting stories there. You don't have any interesting stories now that
                    you're doing other work.”</p>
                <p>And I think that's true, because you were dealing with human-interest
                    problems.</p>
                <p>The pressure to come to America was increasing all the time. Jim Mason left and
                    we finally got Hugh McCall, another consular officer, and they worked away,
                    standing out at the visa counter, interviewing people, you know. We gave the
                    first refugee relief visa while I was in Manila, too (I have a picture of myself
                    signing that), to a couple.</p>
                <p>But visas in Hong Kong was quite different, because there you were dealing with a
                    totally alien culture and language, so most of your interviews had to be done
                    with interpreters. And you were dealing with a dialect, the Tai Shan dialect,
                    that's not very widespread, but this is where most of the emigrants originally
                    come from in China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is from the Canton area.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Canton area, right. Tai Shan is a rural district outside of Canton.
                    There, of course, the big problem was the fraud problem, which had resulted, of
                    course, in one of my predecessor's ending up in Leavenworth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The prison in Leavenworth.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Yes, in the prison in Leavenworth, some several years before. But that
                    was a totally different type of operation. I had more people there. We had, I
                    think, four vice consuls and a wonderful consular supervisor in Buck Backey, who
                    was as good as they come. So we had a happy unit and it worked well. We were
                    assisted by a very large fraud unit of about fifteen investigators who'd been
                    sent out from Washington. They were investigating both visa and refugee relief
                    fraud, led by Ed Garrity and Frank Waffen and others.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laurie Lawrence, I think, was there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Laurie Lawrence was one. Vic Dikeos was another. Good people, worked
                    very closely with me. They'd come in and say, “Tom, look what we found under
                    this old applicant's bed. Here is her whole history going back, and here's her
                    fraud school papers she picked up last week.” You know, things like this. No,
                    they did good work. It was an interesting place to be in those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, sort of from this touch of real life, you came
                        back.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Well, excuse me, one thing yet. I well remember it. One Sunday night I
                    had to go down and meet a battered old steamer coming from Shanghai. And on that
                    steamer was Father Fulgence Gross, a Franciscan priest, who had been held for
                    six years in solitary confinement in Shanghai and had just been released. There
                    were three Franciscans and myself there. It was about eight o'clock on a Sunday
                    night. Father Gross came out and he just stood there. He looked around and he
                    started to weep, you know, just the sight of his fellow priests, but also
                    freedom. I never forgot that. The next day, he was kind enough to come into the
                    consulate, and we got some of his story down, and we got him packed off to
                    Chicago where he was going back to his family. But some of the things he told us
                    about the Communist jail made us realize that it was for real. The conditions
                    were terrible.</p>
                <p>But that's the sort of thing you do in consular work. I really found it
                    fascinating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, Tom, then you came back to Washington, where
                        you served from '57 to '61. What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: I was in the Executive Secretariat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The whole time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Yes, for those four years. The first year, I was a regular worker up
                    there, and then I took over from Gene McAuliffe as the head of what was called
                    the Reports and Operations section, with about fifteen officers under me at that
                    time. We were doing all the paperwork that went to the secretary and the Under
                    Secretary, filtering it up through the executive director. We also were
                    accompanying the secretary and the Under Secretary on their trips abroad, so I
                    made a number of trips around the world with various secretaries of state.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of how the department operated? I
                        mean, you were in a good position to take a look. To begin with, it was the
                        Dulles...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Yes, I was there with Dulles. Dulles, Herter, and Rusk, I had three of
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By that time, Dulles had been there some time and it was a
                        fairly well-established operation. How did it work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Under Mr. Dulles, I think it operated smoothly. And out of his vest
                    pocket, too. Mr. Dulles was the law. He had very strong views on certain
                    policies, and these were our policies. He had few people close to him. Part of
                    this was because he had a vision problem, he couldn't see well. In a staff
                    meeting, you know, he couldn't see many people. But, of all three of them, when
                    you got them in the small confines of an airplane on an overseas trip, Mr.
                    Dulles was the most human in some ways—coming out and playing bridge with us,
                    having a good time and relaxing with his old sweater and slippers on. When you
                    got to the conference, he was all steely granite, you know, every bit the
                    international lawyer-turned-diplomat.</p>
                <p>Mr. Herter was the patrician, in a nutshell.</p>
                <p>And Dean Rusk is just a fine fellow, a nice man and an excellent thinker.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you notice any difference in the method of operation,
                        of using the secretariat, with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Mr. Dulles, I would say, was more a conceptualizer. He really was. Mr.
                    Rusk was more of a staff man in some ways. Excellent staff man. A very bright
                    man himself. Dulles didn't care about staff work.</p>
                <p>A good example is: When he was wrestling, back in the mid-'50s (this was just
                    before my time), with trying to establish something called the Baghdad Pact, I'm
                    told that he did not deal with the assistant secretary for Near East and African
                    Affairs on that, George Allen, he'd talk only to Herman Ayles, who was then the
                    desk officer for that Iranian peninsula up there. “Because,” he said, “Mr. Ayles
                    understands what I want.” He did that in other areas, too. He would find the
                    person who understood what he wanted and work directly—call him on the phone and
                    say, “Well, what can we do now? I've got this idea, is that a good one?”</p>
                <p>And they'd say, “Well, Mr. Secretary, yes, but, you know, you'd have the French
                    going to the wall.” Or something like this.</p>
                <p>Whereas Rusk would never do that. He was, you know, pretty much right down the
                    line.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>And we had some very, very strong and good office directors in my day. I think of
                    Stewart Rockwell running Middle East, very good; Martin Hillenbrand doing German
                    Affairs; Bob McBride doing Western Europe. And there were others of that
                    caliber. You could depend on them, and the secretaries did depend on them for
                    those things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find, because you were working basically on
                        clearing a certain amount of papers and all that, that if they came from one
                        area, you didn't have to worry as much about these papers because the
                        officers knew what they were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: That's what I'm trying to say. Exactly right. If you saw something that
                    had been cleared or drafted by the type of officer I mentioned, there was no
                    problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you know, one of the things that I look at in these
                        interviews of people who are in positions such as yours is the various
                        bureaus. I wonder if you could characterize sort of a ranking, you know, as
                        you looked at this. I mean, I'm talking about just in clout and in
                        effectiveness at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: I think, during Mr. Dulles and Mr. Herter's period, you'd have to say
                    the Bureau of European Affairs was running it. African Affairs didn't matter;
                    there weren't any real African affairs much. You couldn't ignore what was then
                    known as the Bureau of Far Eastern Affairs, just because things kept happening
                    out there that you didn't want to happen, like the Quemoy and Matsu incidents,
                    and various other things, and always trouble around Korea, and then the
                    beginnings of trouble in Indochina. Near East and Asian Affairs, I'd say, would
                    be the third tier at that time. Again, it couldn't be ignored, because you had
                    the Israeli-Arab problem always, and you had India out there, and, in my period,
                    as I referred to, we had the Iran oil crisis and Mossadegh. Latin America came
                    last.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, you know, every person I ask, it always comes
                        up this way. Now...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: May I make an addition to that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: When Mr. Rusk took over, it was changed. I would say at least a
                    priority as high as Europe with him was Far East.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And of course he had been assistant secretary for Far
                        Eastern Affairs, plus the fact that the whole Indochina thing had reached a
                        boil.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: I think Far East certainly went above Middle East then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, the ranking of Latin American Affairs. I mean,
                        looking at it at the time we're talking about. Did you have a feeling about
                        the issues there, I mean, it just went Latin America was not of much concern
                        to us, or also it was because it wasn't as strong a bureau to bring its
                        problems there? How did you feel about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: I think part of the problem is our Eurocentrism: our backgrounds, our
                    educations, and so forth. We don't study Latin American history. Until recent
                    years, we didn't study Spanish enough. I think that's going to be changing in
                    years to come, but I'm not sure our Eurocentrism will end. Now, I agree with
                    you, there were some strong officers in Latin America, but there were fewer.
                    There were fewer. They didn't stand out. And the thing is, it was known as
                    pretty much an incestuous circuit. You know, if you knew Spanish, you'd go out
                    from one post in Latin America to another post in Latin America, with an
                    occasional diversion of Spain maybe, and back in Washington, but, you know, you
                    wouldn't get around. That was less so with the other bureaus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know, as a thirty-year veteran of the Foreign Service, I
                        assiduously avoided learning Spanish because I always considered Latin
                        America to be a black hole—if you learned Spanish, you disappeared never to
                        be heard of again.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Well, that was true in the old days, and Kissinger finally got so mad
                    at that in 1974 that he said, “We're going to have a shake-up.” I remember
                    that's why I got sent to Israel, we had a shake-up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, one last question about this time you were in the
                        Secretariat. How did it work, the transition between the Eisenhower
                        administration and the Kennedy administration? I mean, how did you see it?
                        Was it a friendly or a hostile takeover, from your perspective of this
                        takeover?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Yes, very interesting. At that time, I was acting deputy director for
                    the moment because we'd lost some... And it was just at the time that we had
                    moved into the new building. We'd been over on 21st Street until December of
                    1960. And, finally, most everybody else had moved, and Secretary Herter said
                    that it was time to go, so we moved over. That was six weeks before the
                    inauguration of Kennedy.</p>

                <p>The takeover didn't go all that smoothly, because Kennedy was determined to get
                    his own people in there. And he did. They came in at all levels. Most of them
                    charged-up. Ideas. Bright. Good, bright people, ready to roll. He made one
                    mistake, of course. He put Chester Bowles as number two in the department, in
                    charge of ambassadorial assignments. And that didn't work very well at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why didn't that work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Mr. Bowles is a distinguished gentleman and a very fine one, but he had
                    strong ideas of his own.</p>
                <p>I have a Foreign Service friend, a retired ambassador, who once accompanied him
                    on a trip out in Ethiopia, and he said, “I wish Mr. Bowles would stop
                    apologizing for not being born black.” Now I don't know how fair that is, but it
                    gave you a flavor.</p>
                <p>Both he and his wife, as you know, his wife particularly, when they served in
                    India, adopted Indian costume and walking around in saris. They felt very
                    strongly for the Third World. Now this was very noticeable because Mr. Bowles
                    was on one side of the Secretariat and the secretary was on the other, so we
                    knew his visitors and followed his schedule. And anybody from the Third
                    World—any prince, any prime minister or foreign minister—could get in to see
                    Bowles, but people from the more advanced world often had great difficulty
                    getting appointments. But if you were from Africa or Asia, and Latin America to
                    a lesser extent, you could get an appointment.</p>
                <p>And Mr. Bowles just wasn't a staff man. Nick Veliotes was then working in his
                    office. Nick was an old friend of mine, we worked together in the Secretariat.
                    He said, “Tom, he's got a stack of papers that high, but he doesn't do
                    paperwork. All he wants to do is talk with people. He does that all day long,
                    and we can't get any actions out of him.” So I think that was the reason he was
                    eventually sent off as ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any other problems of some of the...I think of
                        a man who just died very recently, Stephen Smith, and some others? These
                        were, in those days, considered rather brash young people. Did this affect
                        our work at all, as far as you saw it, in the Secretariat?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: We could read it was going on. It didn't really affect us; we were sort
                    of insulated up there from that type. Down in ARA there were a couple of them
                    that had come in, hard-charging and so forth. For the first year, no one knew
                    who was in charge of ARA. You had Adolf Berle and Bob Sayer and a few others,
                    all sort of with titles of acting assistant secretary, and no one knew who was
                    in charge. Goodwin was there. Very peculiar arrangement, I must say.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>Funny things stick out in your mind. (I'll probably be shot for saying some of
                    these things.) President Kennedy decided early on that he wanted to come over
                    and visit the department. Secretary Rusk had just moved into his new quarters
                    and so forth. The executive secretary's office has a glass wall facing out on
                    the elevator bank there on the seventh floor. I was out there, and we had a very
                    attractive black secretary there with me and one or two other people. And
                    suddenly the door burst open, a number of people rushed out, and there came the
                    president, glowing, ruddy, looking never better. As he wandered around our
                    corner and he saw Marilyn, our black secretary, he gave a big smile, you know:
                    Ah! Glad-to-see-you're-integrated-up-here sort of thing. I laughed at that.</p>
                <p>Another story Dean Rusk told years later about those days...and I hope I'm not
                    rambling too much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, this is fine.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: We got word in early January of '61 that Mr. Rusk, who had been
                    nominated secretary of state, wanted to come over and look at the new office.
                    Well, Secretary Herter said, “Yes, come on over. I'd be delighted to see you
                    here.” So we were told to see that the man had no trouble. So I took one of our
                    young officers in the Secretariat and I said, “Frank, I want you to go
                    downstairs. He's going to come in that main C Street entrance, and I want you to
                    meet him and escort him upstairs. And here's his picture and so forth.” Frank's
                    a good man, I thought, all right. “And, you know, show him around.” Well, a few
                    minutes later, Frank came up with Mr. Rusk, a tall gentleman with a
                    distinguished round face, and bald, you know. They went into the secretary's
                    office, and everything went well.</p>
                <p>Years later, Rusk said that what had happened was this: He said, “You know, I got
                    to the department, and I said to my wife later that night, 'I've never seen such
                    friendly people.'”</p>
                <p>She said, “Well, what do you mean?”</p>
                <p>He said, “Well, I got to the department and there was this young officer waiting
                    to see me, and he said, 'Well, hello, Dean. Come on in, Dean.'” He said, “I
                    looked at him and he said, 'Right this way, Dean.'”</p>
                <p>Well, it turns out that Frank had read his biography and that he'd been a dean
                    out at Mills College, you see, and thought that was his title.</p>
                <p>And Rusk, he chuckled when he told that story.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left the Secretariat in 1961, and then you were in
                        Bonn for three years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Yes, after a year at the National War College, I was in Bonn for three
                    years. And I would have been there longer, but my tour was broken and I was
                    brought back to the department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in Bonn?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Well, I had two very interesting jobs in Bonn. I was in the political
                    section my whole time there. And the political section had three main sections.
                    I had one of them, and that was the political-military section, which dealt with
                    all our relations with German military, our liaison with the American forces in
                    Europe, on the military side; on the political side, we handled such things as
                    the MLF, that project.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was it, multilateral...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Multilateral force, yes, in which we were going to put missiles on
                    board merchant ships in the Atlantic. We also dealt with NATO affairs, on the
                    political side, and a number of other things. I did that for a little over a
                    year, and then, because of a change in the office, I was moved into another
                    section, the internal political section, dealing with the German political
                    parties, their structure, the Bundestag, and so forth. I found that fascinating,
                    too. So they were two very worthwhile assignments that I enjoyed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there during sort of the Berlin Wall crisis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: No, I came a year after the Berlin Wall had been put up. The third
                    section in the political section, which I didn't mention, was known as Berlin
                    and Eastern affairs, and they dealt entirely with that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, all right, it was a year after the Berlin Wall went
                        up and all. How did you and your colleagues view “the Soviet threat” at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: We saw it in military terms. There was no question they had large
                    forces in Eastern Europe, and they had also built-up the East German army to
                    where it was a rather sizable and, we thought, fairly potent force. So there was
                    no question in our minds that it was there. Now those were days when we still
                    had the backlash of Stalin. I mean, that whole era. We were not going to take
                    any chances was the feeling. There was little dialogue. Kennedy did start it and
                    did get the nuclear nonproliferation agreement signed and the limits on
                    underground testing treaty finally signed, which were real breakthroughs in
                    those days.</p>
                <p>But the relations with the Soviets were cold. Our ambassadors would call on the
                    Soviet ambassador in East Germany when they were there, in their capacity not as
                    ambassador to East Germany, which we didn't recognize, but in their capacity as
                    the representative to the Control Commission for Germany, since the ambassadors
                    were given those titles. But, aside from that, there was little dialogue back
                    and forth, and that didn't happen until much later when Willy Brandt became
                    prime minister and launched his Eastern policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any great crises in NATO, or was NATO a pretty
                        solid system by the time you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: By this time, NATO was a fairly solid organization. One of the major
                    crises we had when I was doing political-military affairs, and it was a big one,
                    was a fear in Washington, not shared by our embassy in Bonn, I must say, but I
                    sensed it before I left, that if we did not do something to provide the Germans
                    with nuclear weapons, they were going to get them on their own. Franz Joseph
                    Strauss was defense minister, and, while he was a brilliant man, we didn't
                    entirely trust his instincts that he was a nationalist. So this is why we came
                    up with ideas like the multilateral force, which our navy abhorred, but
                    which...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was also putting international crews...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: International crews, mixed-man crews on merchant ships. And some talk
                    of having it on submarines, too, but that proved almost impossible. Merchant
                    ships which would just cruise around aimlessly until needed and then launch
                    their missiles.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>I well remember, we were trying to sell this in NATO and were having a difficult
                    time. We knew we had to get the big ones on our side. Harold MacMillan, as I
                    recall, went along because he wanted other things from us. The French were not
                    playing. So we needed the Germans. And George Ball, who by this time was Under
                    Secretary, was sent over to persuade the Germans. It was in January of '63. We
                    had a day-long meeting with Adenauer; I was along on that. At the end, the
                    chancellor said, in translation, “Mr Secretary, my military people tell me this
                    is not a good idea. But if your president wants it, we will go along,” Which is
                    all we could hope for. We put that in the bank, in a sense, went back to the
                    embassy residence, and there, which was now about five-thirty or quarter to six
                    at night, Mr. Ball received a message containing the speech that de Gaulle had
                    made that day in which he'd blackballed Britain for the Economic Community.
                    Well, Ball reddened and just about went through the roof.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because he was the supreme Europeanist.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: He was the supreme Europeanist, and this was a direct slap at him. And
                    there were reporters present; the ambassador had invited a group of people over
                    for a drink to meet Ball. And he said, as I recall, pretty much on the record,
                    what he thought about de Gaulle for doing that, you know. He was livid about it.
                    So, on the one hand, you had the good news from Adenauer and, on the other, the
                    bad news from de Gaulle at the same time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression in dealing with the Germans as
                        far as the depth of their democracy and the efficiency of their government
                        within a democratic framework? I mean, at that time, how did you feel about
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Hopeful. Most of those we dealt with at that stage were veterans of
                    World War II. They remembered it vividly. They'd had much more combat experience
                    than almost all of our people. They certainly didn't want another war. They had
                    no sympathy for the Russians and no truck with them. Maybe some sympathy, yes,
                    but not for their system of life and certainly not to have it imposed on
                    Germany.</p>
                <p>Now Adenauer was a democrat in an authoritarian way. I mean, yes, he had
                    elections and they were free elections, and he had a Parliament and it was a
                    free Parliament, but he'd been raised in a strict authoritarian tradition
                    himself, and he was already in his early '80s, I guess, at that time, so he
                    could see no other way than, you know, when father decides, the children should
                    behave.</p>
                <p>But that is not out of keeping, I don't think, with German tradition in many
                    ways. It has nothing to do with political democracy the way we understand it.
                    Their behavior patterns at times are different.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>We were constantly getting reports about, running into, hearing about, and seeing
                    little splinter neo-Nazi group coming up, which on certain issues in certain
                    regions would gain some thousands of votes. And we knew that there were
                    unreconstructed and unrepentant Nazis there. They were largely not in positions
                    of political power. Now it's true, they were getting into positions of economic
                    power in the business world, where they were not forbidden, and things of that
                    nature. There were a few of them in the Parliament, but very few basically of
                    what we would call the “wrong” types. All in all, I would mark it as
                    hopeful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you view George McGhee as an ambassador? How did
                        he operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: I was there under two ambassadors: Walter Dowling and George McGhee.
                    One year with Dowling and two with McGhee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, sort of compare and contrast.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Quite different. Dowling was the consummate traditional diplomat.</p>
                <p>McGhee was boisterous, almost rambunctious, at times, brilliant at others. Hard
                    working, dedicated. A man of a thousand ideas. Loyal to his staff. Quite
                    effective, I think, with the Germans. A man who spoke all over Germany all the
                    time, touched every issue, dodged none. Put forth the American view quite, quite
                    well. He couldn't stand a situation of quiet when nothing was going on.
                    Something had to be going on. I don't know if I could explain that very well,
                    but that was the feeling: “What's the old man up to now? What's he doing
                    now?”</p>
                <p>“Well, he's cooking up something.”</p>
                <p>For instance, for a long time, he had behind him in his office a speaker going
                    all the time reciting German grammar. He thought, you know, subliminally he
                    could pick it up even though he was talking to you. He'd say, “Now, Kennedy,
                    what are we going to do about this? Hadn't we better go see so and so? Maybe I
                    ought to write a letter to the president about this.” Meanwhile, the
                    German...</p>
                <p>But that eventually stopped.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how about your impression of the Germans you dealt
                        with in the bureaucracy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Competent, in almost all cases. I saw two different sides of them. The
                    first year and a half, when I was in dealing in political-military affairs, I
                    dealt a good with the beamte, the civil servant side, because we were dealing
                    with problems relating to American forces.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>I'll never forget the first day I arrived in Bonn. I was told by my staff that
                    morning, “You've got to chair a meeting this afternoon.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Chair a meeting? I'm just here.”</p>
                <p>“Oh, no, this meeting has been set up for a long time.”</p>
                <p>I said, “What's the subject?”</p>
                <p>And they said, “The subject is Sewer Duties in Kaisersbaumen.”</p>
                <p>I said, “What do I know about that?”</p>
                <p>And they said, “Well, we'll help you.”</p>
                <p>The question was: How much should the American forces (which were very large in
                    that area) have to pay for use of the sewer system?</p>
                <p>So I found myself that afternoon, but I was flanked by our legal advisor, and my
                    advisor on German affairs on these subjects, and a couple of other people, but I
                    sweat through an afternoon...</p>
                <p>But the German beamte you met in that sort of situation were very much the
                    old-style, almost Prussian, type, you know. Correct. They knew their dossiers.
                    They had answers for most of your arguments—not all, but most of them. Humor was
                    not their long suit by any means.</p>
                <p>Now it was different when I would go to the Foreign Office to talk about issues.
                    There, you'd meet types that I would say were a bit suave or equally well
                    educated, but who had been abroad in many cases and had a broader prospect. They
                    saw things from a little different angle. They were very anxious, it seemed, to
                    be friendly with American and British diplomats and others, to show that they
                    were good partners in the Western world. This was quite important to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tom, we've reached the point now where you returned to the
                        United States. What were you doing? You were there from '65 to '69.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Yes. I had gone back on home leave from Bonn in the late summer of '64
                    and expected to have another two years there. But in May of '65 I got promoted,
                    and shortly thereafter a call came, which I didn't get but which came to our
                    DCM, Martin Hillenbrand, from Joe Palmer, who was then the director general of
                    the Foreign Service. He said, “I want Tom Dunnigan to come back here. We're
                    starting a new program called the Junior Officer Program, and I want him to head
                    it up.”</p>
                <p>And Hillenbrand said, “Well, you know, he's been back about six, eight months
                    from home leave, in the political section, heading up one of our sections. He's
                    not due to leave.”</p>
                <p>The long and short of it was, I went. I got my orders and I went. I was not very
                    pleased about it, but went back.</p>
                <p>And what was happening was that they were reorganizing the handling of personnel.
                    This was one Mr. Crockett's ideas. All personnel were to be handled in three
                    different units: seniors officers were to be handled by Bill Boswell;
                    middle-grade officers were to be handled by Harry Simms; and I was to handle the
                    junior officers. In those days, that meant officers in Classes Six, Seven, and
                    Eight. There were quite a few hundred of them. And that meant their assignments
                    basically; we were bringing them into the service and so forth. It meant sending
                    them over to the Foreign Service Institute and working very closely with Alex
                    Daven, who was then running the A-100 course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A-100 being the basic officers' course on entry
                        level.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: I had five counselors working with me there. We took all officers and
                    split them up alphabetically. One officer would handle, say, all those A, B, and
                    C last names and so forth. And that worked pretty well. They would interview
                    every officer in depth, particularly the in-coming officers, spend forty-five
                    minutes to an hour with them, finding out what their interests were, their
                    backgrounds, what they thought they might like to do, always cautioning them
                    that, not knowing the Foreign Service, they shouldn't ever look down their nose
                    at doing anything, because they might find it interesting.</p>
                <p>So, as a result of that, working with the bureaus of the department who would
                    send us a memorandum telling us which junior officers they needed, we would then
                    work out assignments for these people.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>Now the real part of the program began overseas in the first assignment, because
                    we had what was called the rotational system. Every new officer was rotated and
                    was to do no more than the average of six months in one section. We wanted them
                    to get an experience of various disciplines in the Foreign Service. Also, we
                    handled them for three tours, on the Junior Officer Program. They left us after
                    having completed that third tour, or after having been promoted from Six to
                    Five, whichever came first. Now, during those three tours, we tried to work it
                    that an officer had one tour in a developed country, one tour in an undeveloped
                    country, and one tour in the department, to sort of round them out for their
                    mid-career. And it worked pretty well; I would say in seventy, seventy-five
                    percent of the cases, we were successful in doing that, and also in seeing to
                    their rotation, because each post was responsible to us. These people were
                    assigned on our complement; we paid for them. They were not on the post
                    complement, you see, so we could jerk them out of there if the post was
                    maltreating them, which happened in one or two cases. But we would get special
                    reports on these officers, on special forms, how they were doing in their
                    rotation. And most of them did beautifully, very, very well, and we were so
                    pleased with it.</p>
                <p>Now this program was killed some years later under Idar Rimestad, because he said
                    the late Senator Ellender from Louisiana had been to Latin America and talked
                    with a couple of junior officers who didn't like the idea, so the program should
                    be killed and they weren't going to give any more funds. So I got a note: “The
                    Junior Officer Program, as you know, is dead. No more rotation.”</p>
                <p>About that time, I was leaving the program, I just washed my hands of it. I did
                    deal with senior officers the last six months I was there. That had been
                    reorganized.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in this, why did Palmer pick on you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: I'd known Joe in London. And I don't know whether he was buttering me
                    up, but he said, “Tom, I want an officer who will be a good image for our
                    younger officers.” Nobody could have made a better image than Joe himself. I
                    said, “Well, that's very nice of you, Joe...” But I was happy where I was.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this is something (I might add that I was in
                        Personnel dealing with mid-career officers at the same time, and so we had
                        dealings) but something, for somebody who has not dealt with the Foreign
                        Service this is sort of parenthetical, that somebody like Harry Simms was at
                        the very acme of his career, and others. So, I mean, Personnel had, and
                        probably still has today, a far greater role than in a normal business. And
                        most of the best officers usually had a stint in Personnel at one time or
                        another. And the Foreign Service can take pride in doing that. For one
                        thing, it helps further your own career. One, to help your next assignment,
                        but also to know how the system works. But whatever it is, the chemistry is
                        there. This is not sort of a bureaucratic sideshow; it's right at the guts
                        of the whole Foreign Service system.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: I've felt for many years as you do, Stu. I felt that every officer owed
                    at least one tour to what I call the system. It may not be in Personnel, but in
                    some other part of administration running the system. I think we can give them
                    that. Because if we don't get our good people into it, we have only ourselves to
                    blame for what happens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now this set-up of this rotational program, I recall
                        it because I dealt with it both in Washington but also overseas when I was
                        in charge of the consular section in Belgrade. And we had people coming
                        through.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Yes, you did, we assigned a number to Belgrade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Two of them, David Anderson and Tom Niles, became
                        ambassadors later on. But, I mean, it wasn't a fooling around thing. I mean,
                        when you got these people you did feel that there was a central command
                        there. And also, when I came into Personnel, for the only time in my career
                        I felt that there really was sort of an overview of somebody really looking
                        at real personnel development. Were you sort of given a blank slate to
                        figure out the type of junior officer thing, or was that pretty well set up
                        beforehand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: No, we were given a fairly blank slate. No one had done this before, in
                    a way, so we learned by doing.</p>
                <p>I think the thing I regret most, and I couldn't do anything about it, was, the
                    last six months I was in charge, we had to send all our young males to Vietnam
                    to work in the COORDS program out there. But that was out of our hands, that
                    came from the White House.</p>
                <p>But up till then... And, you know, I've learned of officers even today who I
                    assigned, oh, lo those many years ago, and said, “Well, how was it?” And they
                    say it was good. I bumped into a young lady who I assigned to Sri Lanka back in
                    '66, and I said, “Well, how did you do?”</p>
                <p>And she said, “I loved it.”</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lange Schmerhorn, by any chance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Yes, Lange.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because she served with me in Vietnam, that was a second
                        tour.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Is that right. But she said, “Yes, I liked it.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you sort of summarize or discuss a little what sort
                        of people were we getting in? Because this is '65 to '69. This is at the
                        height of student revolt, the Vietnam War was going up. I mean, a lot of
                        things were ticking. What were you seeing in the people who were coming in?
                        Characterize them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: We were getting excellent people of whom anyone could be proud. Their
                    heads were well put on. There were discussions about Vietnam. Not everyone
                    agreed with all our policies, very certainly. Most of them did not want to be in
                    the military, although I don't think that was the reason they had come into the
                    Foreign Service, but the men all went willingly to Vietnam. It wouldn't have
                    been their choice, in most cases.</p>
                <p>The only case of a person who gave me any problems was one man, and a woman, of
                    course, who came to me at the end. He'd been assigned to Vietnam, and she
                    somewhere else, and they said, with a funny look on their face, they were going
                    to get married, so he couldn't go to Vietnam. And the long and short of it is, I
                    think they both resigned from the service.</p>
                <p>But everyone else went there, and some of them did beautifully. And some of them
                    went on and made very fine careers out of it; some of them became specialists in
                    Southeast Asia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a period, I recall, being a supervising officer
                        later on, which was really, I think, the fun period for most people, because
                        we were having officers who would talk back to you, but intelligently.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a much more interesting crew than came on later on,
                        I think.</hi>

                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: One day, I was sitting in my office and in burst a group of young
                    junior officers, about four or five of them. And they had a great big placard
                    with them. It says: “STARTING BUS DRIVERS ARE PAID $6,900 A YEAR.” And they
                    said, “You see, Mr. Dunnigan, you're only paying us $6,500. You know, that's
                    awful.”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Yes, it's awful. But, gentlemen, if you want to be bus drivers, I
                    think you ought to apply there. You came into this career for something far
                    different from driving a bus. Ten years from now, when you look back, you'll be
                    making three times what any bus driver does who joins the service today. But I
                    wouldn't want to stop you, I mean, if that's your career.”</p>
                <p>Well, they sort of mumbled, and I never heard any more about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I recall, because those bus-driver signs were all on
                        buses that we rode to and from the Foreign Service Institute, and we'd all
                        look and glower.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: They had to take one of these out and bring it in to me and say, “Look
                    what you've done to us!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, had you the feeling that because of the campus
                        disputes, that those that really were actively opposed to our involvement in
                        Vietnam, or just sort of anti-government, just weren't showing up in your
                        bailiwick?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: They were turned off by government, probably, as much as anything else.
                    They didn't want to be a part of “the system,” so they wouldn't apply.</p>
                <p>I used to go around and speak to college campuses in those days. My most
                    interesting experience, in some ways, came out at San Diego State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the home of Marcuse and others.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Right, right. It was a hot October day, and I was scheduled to speak
                    one afternoon in the student auditorium. Well, I didn't know, until I got to the
                    campus that morning, that they were having a big SDS rally that day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's the Students for a Democratic Society.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Exactly. And there were placards all over, you know, even outside the
                    auditorium where I spoke, “Students for a Democratic Society Rally,” and “Throw
                    the Pigs Out,” and so forth. So I was in an auditorium, looking up at hundreds
                    of students sort of glowering, it seemed to me, at me. Some interested, but
                    others glowering. And I said, “Well, I thought it was very nice of them to have
                    so many signs of welcome.” And they suddenly looked at each other. And I said,
                    “Well, I see these big signs saying 'SDS.' I presume that's 'Students for the
                    Department of State.'” Well, there was a sudden silence, and then everybody
                    burst out laughing. And, from then on, we got on with my discussion and we got
                    along all right. But, you know, if you took them lightly at times, you could get
                    away with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How well did the training work, do you think? I mean, the
                        basic training and all this. I mean, you were looking at getting the
                        feedback.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: I think Alex Daven was a good model for me. He ran the program while I
                    was there. Alex was a trained teacher before he'd come in the Foreign Service, a
                    good lecturer. And he told it as it was, not, you know, as the book says. He
                    said, “Now, kids, I'm going to tell you, you're going to find it this way.
                    You're going to find a boss whose wife you don't like. And you've got to behave
                    this way, and you've got to do this and that. But don't forget that you're going
                    to move on soon, or the boss is going to move, you're not married to them
                    forever.” So he was good.</p>
                <p>I think, now, the training may be a little more thorough, now that they've set up
                    this consular post over there. I think that's an excellent idea. And they were
                    beginning to work on that about the time I left, saying we've got to do more
                    about that, and why not have some sort of arrangement where they act out some
                    parts? I understand they do it very well down there, and I'm all for that.</p>
                <p>Of course, things like political and economic reporting are hard to teach. You
                    can talk to them, you can explain the types of things that are reported, but
                    there are inborn knacks for that, particularly for political reporting, nuances
                    that you absorb as you go along. I think the students in my day were still
                    writing fairly good English. I understand that is occasionally a problem
                    anymore. We didn't have so much of that then, they were quite good at it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time, did you feel that you could sort of pick out
                        who were going to be the leaders?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: In some cases. Not in all. Some of those who have gone the farthest
                    were not those I would have picked at the time. Oh, there are a few people who
                    star in any society. One of those who came in, I remember, is Frank Hodsoll, who
                    headed the National Endowment for the Arts after leaving the Foreign Service.
                    Frank was outstanding. He'd been to Yale and been to Cambridge, and done a
                    number of important things—been an officer in the Army or in the Marines or
                    something. You knew Frank was going to rise, and he did rise very well. He was
                    actually so good the White House grabbed him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were some assignments weighted, saying, well, this
                        person's obviously going to go somewhere? I mean, these initial assignments.
                        So that those that looked like they were on the star track might be given
                        more challenging assignments?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Oh, yes, absolutely. We looked at the individual up and down. After our
                    counselors had interviewed each one of them, and written them up, I would read
                    all these interviews. And then we would have a day-long session, the six of us
                    sitting around a table. We had the assignments: ARA needs two in Buenos Aires
                    and one in Lima, and EUR needs one in Warsaw and one in Rome, you know. Who
                    would fit? Who's interested in this? We found it was always better to send a
                    person to a place he or she thought they were interested in going. Whether they
                    were or not, didn't matter. And if a person said they wanted to go to Africa and
                    become an Africanist, find a post for them there. Now you couldn't always do
                    that, of course, because the needs of the service, in the final analysis, had to
                    come first. And we told all of them that they would be doing a good stint of
                    consular work, during their rotation, perhaps. That period might extend up to a
                    year. And it did often. But I said, “Even in the consulate section, we're going
                    to insist you get different experiences—visa and citizenship.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Visas, passports.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Yes, protection work, whatever there is to do. And they accepted that,
                    they liked that. We had very few problems with regard to assignments. One of the
                    few I remember came when... I always went over to meet the class and read off
                    the assignments. And that was quite a banner day for them. And I remember one
                    time the director of FSI, who was then George Allen, was sitting beside me as I
                    read them out. And I read one and I said, “This young man is going to
                    Cairo.”</p>
                <p>And there was a “Who?” George Allen whispered to me, “You can't do that.”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Why not?”</p>
                <p>He says, “He's Jewish.”</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>I said, “He is? I never knew that.” He'd never revealed it to us or never
                    expressed any desire not to go to Egypt.</p>
                <p>Well, we later reconsidered and sent him to Athens, I believe, instead. But that
                    was one of the few that ever came apart because of that.</p>
                <p>Another one was a young lady who had all the earmarks of success about her. She'd
                    studied Russian, was anxious to go there, in fact spoke Russian and majored in
                    Russian in graduate work. I forget where we assigned her on her first post. We
                    couldn't send her to Moscow on her first tour. Out of maybe five hundred
                    officers we handled, we sent one there at one time, and that was a special need.
                    But we usually assigned them to Eastern Europe somewhere their first tour, or to
                    a post like Berlin or Paris where there could be work connected with Communism.
                    Anyhow, this young lady had gotten her assignment and she came in to see her
                    counselor one day, a woman on the staff, and said, “Oh, I wanted to tell you
                    I'll not be going.”</p>
                <p>And the counselor looked at her and said, “Oh? Why not?”</p>
                <p>“Well,” she said, “you know, I only took this assignment on a bet.”</p>
                <p>And the counselor looked at her.</p>
                <p>And she said, “My boyfriend bet me that I couldn't get into the Foreign Service.
                    And I said, 'I'll show him.' But now I'm not going; I'm going to go home and
                    marry him.”</p>
                <p>We'd spent maybe eight or ten thousand dollars preparing her in many ways, and
                    the little things like that were down the tubes. Those are the ones you
                    lose.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Tom, you left there when this program (which, to
                        anybody who was dealing with this as I did, was a very worthy program)
                        unfortunately went down basically because of a political whim.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Unfortunately.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: I was political counselor there under Ambassador Middendorf, who had
                    just arrived when I arrived, and we had a new DCM, John Bovey, so the three of
                    us were new there. I'd been given Dutch language training prior to when I went,
                    and so I was able to land and get operating right away. And it was a very
                    interesting post.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the main issues that you dealt with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: The main issues were in NATO with the Dutch. They were generally with
                    us on most issues. We were trying to sell them a good deal of equipment. And a
                    lot of our time was spent, and the ambassador, too, he was a good salesman, on
                    having...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He'd been secretary of the Navy, hadn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Later. Later, he was secretary of the Navy, after this.</p>
                <p>But, for instance, they wanted to buy a new antisubmarine plane. And the French
                    were in there with their model, the Breguet, and we came in with our Orion, as I
                    recall. And we did finally eventually sell it. We also tried to sell the Dutch
                    the F-16s and certain other planes that they were interested in getting.</p>
                <p>Now the NATO issues had to do with storage matters. See, I had two tours in
                    Holland and I get a little mixed up. The second tour, we had, in some ways, more
                    important issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we'll come back to that in time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Then, of course, as political counselor, I had the internal political
                    situation there, where we had a change of government from what was basically the
                    Christian Democrats to the Socialists and so forth. So we were working closely
                    with the politicians.</p>
                <p>There were a few major issues of difference. We had, of course, tremendous
                    commercial operation there, the Dutch being the world's largest purchasers of
                    American agricultural products in those days.</p>
                <p>But that was a relatively serene period, I would say. The Dutch had built-up
                    their military after the invasion of Czechoslovakia. They had put out another
                    armored division, which we were very pleased with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that point, the Dutch hadn't developed this almost
                        virulent left-wing group.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Yes, it was just coming. It was coming. It started a couple of years
                    before I got there, and it was becoming ever more noticeable, particularly in
                    Amsterdam. The Provos, as they were first called, were agin everything: agin
                    NATO, agin American involvement in Vietnam, of course. Now this was another big
                    problem for us in those years, Vietnam, because the Dutch were not at all
                    sympathetic to us out there.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you deal with them on this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: How will I say we dealt with them? We dealt with them honestly, but
                    with the understanding that we were not going to agree on certain things. We
                    would tell them what we were doing, we would ask them for help in certain
                    things, for instance sending a hospital ship. They would once in a while do that
                    sort of thing for us, but they would always run into flak in the Parliament
                    about getting involved. They had had their troops in Korea, and they weren't
                    going to have them out in Vietnam, you could be sure of that. At that time, too,
                    the Dutch were still angry with us over what they considered our role in forcing
                    them out of Indonesia. They felt we'd put the screws to them and told them they
                    had to get out of there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they weren't at all unhappy to see us involved in that
                        area ourselves.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: There was a bit of an I-told-you-so about it, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find there was a problem...I mean, after
                        all, it's a matter of size and all. The Dutch have never rested well with
                        their eastern neighbor, Germany, anyway, particularly because during the war
                        their occupation was a really nasty, brutal one. So the fact that we
                        depended an awful lot on and had very close relations with Germany, did that
                        reflect on our relations with the Dutch, where they felt that maybe we were
                        too close?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: To some extent, and yet the Dutch were smart enough to see that it was
                    necessary. The Dutch have some traits similar to Germans, but they're very
                    different in other ways. Attitudes, for instance. Their background in democracy.
                    Their respect for individual rights is much stronger than it is in Germany.
                    Things like that.</p>
                <p>Holland is a small country that doesn't want to be regarded as a small country.
                    They want to play with the big boys. So you'll find that they're always among
                    the first to send a force down to the Gulf now, or stand up. Whenever there's
                    anything going on in the world where other countries are involved, Holland will
                    be there. Most small countries wait until the big boys have done the work and
                    then they'll come in later, but not the Dutch. They were once a major power back
                    in the 17th century, and they like to recall that. And they are very welcome,
                    too.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to move on here; we'll come back to Holland later.
                        You went to Copenhagen from '72 to '75 as the deputy chief of mission under

                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Well, I started with a much more colorful man, Fred Russell, who was a
                    political appointee. But we were only together four months, and he departed,
                    never to return. And then there were almost eleven months when we had no
                    ambassador, so I was charg� during that period, and then Phil Crowe was
                    appointed.</p>
                <p>But the reason we weren't appointing one, we were mad at the Danes. The Nixon
                    administration was quite upset with them because of their condemnation of our
                    Christmas bombing of Hanoi. They had been very strongly opposed, and the prime
                    minister and others had said things that were repeated in Washington. And so
                    they just let them stew in their juice.</p>
                <p>But when we had a NATO ministerial meeting in Copenhagen in June of '73,
                    Secretary Rogers came over. And Walt Stoessel, the assistant secretary for
                    European affairs, was along, and Walt told me that we were going to appoint an
                    ambassador, going to probably appoint Phil Crowe, who was then in Norway, to
                    come down. It would take a little while, and he finally got there in September.
                    But the Danes, the queen even, apparently asked Rogers at that time to please
                    send us another ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you know, looking at this, although I'm a retired
                        professional Foreign Service officer, it's always struck me that using the
                        appointment or non-appointment or withdrawal of an ambassador when relations
                        are somewhat strained is a peculiar way to do business. And why would the
                        Danes care whether they're dealing with a deputy chief of mission, a charg�,
                        or an ambassador? What difference does it make?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Prestige. They felt always that an ambassador had a higher in, in the
                    State Department, and that's in prestige, too. Now the Swedes didn't have one,
                    either, for a long time. We were also mad at them for the same reason.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. And the Nixon administration liked to show
                        their...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Liked to show that pique—which it is. In some ways, it's like a spat
                    between young children, you know. It has some of that about it. However, I
                    didn't mind being charg�, you know, from my point of view. But, from a higher
                    political point of view, it was not a good idea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, the prime minister and all made these comments about
                        the Christmas bombing. What did you do about this? I mean, were you given
                        orders to go and tell them how unhappy we were?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Well, I don't think I talked to the prime minister. I mentioned to the
                    Foreign Office, you know, that this was not going down well in Washington and
                    they should know that. Well, they knew it very well, from their reporting from
                    their ambassador there. There was no doubt in their minds about that.</p>
                <p>During that period, I kept up my contacts with the Foreign Ministry. Perhaps not
                    as closely as they had been before, but we certainly did all that was required.
                    We had good political counselors and economic counselors. We've always had good
                    relations with Denmark, but I think there was a little less warmth at that
                    moment.</p>
                <p>I remember their ambassador in Washington came home in June of '73, and he took
                    me out to dinner and said, “Look, we've got to get an ambassador in here.”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Well, Mr. Ambassador, you know why there isn't one.”</p>
                <p>“Well, I know. I keep raising it in the department, but they don't tell me
                    anything.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was really the sort of major driving thing during
                        that period of time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: That was the major feature. We, of course, were always trying to
                    encourage the Danes to do more in NATO. They do less than any other power,
                    basically, and they are the wealthiest country in NATO Europe per capita. They
                    could do a lot more. Well, it never had, since the days of Hagar the Horrible, a
                    very large military force, or since medieval days, anyhow, so it's not in their
                    tradition. They put up no fight against the Germans, compared to the Dutch. They
                    are a small country that acts like a small country, unlike Holland, a small
                    country that acts like a large one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were just mentioning the ambassadors you had.
                        First, Russell, you mentioned he was sort of a character. In what way did
                        you observe this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: He sacked his last DCM. He just didn't like him. The DCM had tried to
                    behave like a normal DCM, I guess, and give him advice on how to do things.
                    Russell felt he was talking down to him—he sacked him. He called Middendorf, my
                    ambassador, and said, “Bill, I need a DCM. Do you have a good man on your
                    staff?”</p>
                <p>And Middendorf said, “Well, I've got Tom Dunnigan here. He's going to be leaving
                    this summer. Why don't you try him?”</p>
                <p>So, the next thing I know, Russell's on the phone with me and said, “Can you meet
                    me in Brussels next week so we can get acquainted?”</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>So I hopped on the train and went down to Brussels. He was there for a meeting of
                    our ambassadors in the EC countries. So we met in a hotel for an hour, and he
                    talked for fifty-five minutes, and I talked for five. Mostly I listened for
                    fifty-five minutes.</p>
                <p>He was a tall, striking, white-haired, good-looking man, with very intense views.
                    Had quit school at twelve to support his family. Had gone to work during the war
                    in the Douglas Aircraft factory in Los Angeles, was a marvelous tinkerer,
                    working with his hands, and ended up as a vice president of Douglas Aircraft.
                    Then founded his own firms out there. Went into real estate; started to build
                    shopping centers. Made beaucoup money.</p>
                <p>Had several chips on his shoulder about the size of small two-by-fours, I think
                    largely because he felt that he didn't have the education these other people
                    did, but, by God, he'd made his own way through hard work. And the only way to
                    treat a competitor, he once told me, was to drive them into the ground, and then
                    you could deal with him. But you had to push him into the ground first. And this
                    was pretty much his way.</p>
                <p>Well, he was very kind to me. I had no problems with him, no blowups in our four
                    months together. But I would go home every night to my wife and say, “Just pour
                    one large martini. I got through another day.” The whole staff, you know...</p>
                <p>His main interest was not in our relations with Denmark, it was in organizing the
                    embassy and making it the most smooth-run organization...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, my God. I mean, particularly a small embassy like
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: He spent hours, and I mean hours, on redesigning the commissary,
                    because he said the shelves were too far apart. And he dragged me down there
                    with the admin. officer and the GSO and the commissary man, and we'd go through
                    that, and he'd say, “Now, look, I built these shopping malls, and I put in
                    grocery stores, and I know if you have a shelf that's eight inches, you can get
                    in so many packed cans. By the way, we have three kinds of coffee. That's
                    wasteful. We'll have one brand only in here. We'll make a lot more.” We spent a
                    lot of our time doing that, building a very modern commissary, up to modern
                    American standards � la Russell. Thing like that were most amusing.</p>
                <p>He'd bedeviled the military, because we had an APO in our MAAG office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Army Postal...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Army Postal Office, yes, that we were allowed to use at the embassy,
                    but it was really a part of the Military Assistance Advisory Group, which sat in
                    another building about three miles away. That wasn't good enough, because he had
                    to wait three hours for them to truck the mail to him. He wanted it in the
                    basement of our building. And the MAAG chief said, “Oh, sir, it says it's got to
                    be in a military facility. It can't be in the embassy.” Well, the next thing you
                    know, he's calling the four-star general in EUCOM who's in charge of all these,
                    and he said, “I want that thing moved!” Within three weeks, we had the post
                    office in the basement of the embassy. Little things like that got done.</p>
                <p>One day, he was going out to meet a very important left-wing Danish politician to
                    talk about Vietnam. This man had issued a blast at us about some atrocity he
                    felt we'd done. We knew he wasn't right, but the ambassador said, “I'm going to
                    straighten him out.”</p>
                <p>I said, “All right.” He had instructions, and I said, “Now, would you like me to
                    go along and take some notes, or Ed Kume, our political officer?”</p>
                <p>“No,” he said, “I don't need any of you people! I'll do it all.”</p>
                <p>Well, he came back and slammed the door after a couple of hours. And nothing ever
                    went to Washington. He said that this fellow was a knothead. He couldn't get
                    through to him. He couldn't get through. The guy didn't have anything to say at
                    all, he just kept repeating that one line. And that was all we ever heard about
                    the incident.</p>
                <p>He did not believe in political reporting. Once, having told me he didn't want
                    any more reports to go out to the department, he said, “They've got too much
                    paper in Washington now. There's no use sending them anything more.” So we had
                    to adopt certain methods to get off telegrams and dispatches.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you do it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: They would come to my desk and I would initial them out, and when the
                    come-back copies would come in the morning, we would not screen them through the
                    old man. And he never caught me, and if he did, he never called me on it,
                    because he realized certain things had to be done. You just couldn't shut off
                    reporting.</p>
                <p>Anyway, that was a colorful period. Then Crowe came, and he was quite different.
                    He was urbane, sophisticated, a man of the world. This was his fourth embassy.
                    He told me when he got there, “Tommy, my doctor said, because of my bad ticker,
                    I shouldn't work after noon every day, so I don't.” So he'd come in about nine
                    and work until noon and disappear. And he led a very active social life. He'd go
                    riding once in a while, but socially. His wife never came.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>Russell didn't have a wife. He said, “I made my wife the richest divorcee in
                    California.” Not that he lacked friends. Neither of them lacked friends
                    whatsoever.</p>
                <p>Crowe would get up for the big things. I mean, we could get him up for those, but
                    he left the running of the embassy pretty much to me. So we got along well.
                    Again, he couldn't have been nicer to me personally. We had no real problems in
                    that regard. He ended up marrying a young Danish lady.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then you moved from this sort of nice European
                        milieu with its problems to really the center of an awful lot of stuff.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Yes. Yes, yes, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get the job, and where'd you go, and what were
                        you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: How I got the job...well, the new ambassador was Mac Toon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about Tel Aviv.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Tel Aviv. Mac Toon was the new ambassador. I was told this story later,
                    and I have no reason to doubt it, by my predecessor, Nick Veliotes. Nick was due
                    to leave, so the department send out five names, proposed DCMs for the
                    ambassador to look at to see which one he liked. He looked at the five and sent
                    it back and said, “I don't like them, send me some more. Don't like any of
                    those.” They sent him five more names, of which mine was the last on the
                    last—the tenth choice. I was the one who had no experience in the Middle East
                    and the other nine apparently had. But I was the only one whom Toon knew, so he
                    said, “I want Dunnigan.”</p>
                <p>Somebody pointed out, “Well, Ambassador, you haven't had any experience in the
                    Middle East and neither has he.”</p>
                <p>He said, “That doesn't matter a goddamn. I know what I want.”</p>
                <p>So I was brought down for a week from Copenhagen, on TDY, to overlap with Nick
                    and also to talk with Toon. Well, we only knew each other casually. I'd met him
                    first in Warsaw, in '47 once, and we'd crossed on a ship when he was going as
                    ambassador to Czechoslovakia in '69. But, you know, it was nothing close, so I
                    was surprised. But it turned out that he didn't want Middle East experts. He
                    said, “They've gotten us into these messes, and we don't need them. We need some
                    fresh looking at this problem.”</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>So that's how I got the job.</p>
                <p>I was surprised. I was supposed, I think, to go as consul general of Frankfurt.
                    But that was broken and off I went to Tel Aviv. And I never regretted it. From a
                    work point of view, it was as interesting as any post. It's nonstop there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do as DCM? Here you were, you had a
                        professional well-skilled ambassador, and you were his DCM. What did you
                        do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: I had two ambassadors. I had Toon for seventeen months, and then he got
                    transferred to Moscow. I was alone for five months there, and then Sam Lewis
                    came the last three or four months.</p>
                <p>Oh, there was plenty to do. Of course, you're on the road to Jerusalem a good
                    part of the time, which is where the Foreign Ministry sits. And that's fifty
                    miles up and fifty miles back, up that mountain and down the mountain. So that
                    takes a good deal of your time.</p>
                <p>I had good relations there, we all did, with the Foreign Ministry. They were very
                    eager to work well with us. Spent a good deal of time with the Defense Ministry,
                    too, because we have a lot of defense problems with them. And I got to see and
                    know the ministers of both as well.</p>
                <p>There was no end of problems—economic frequently. Because even then we were
                    worried, and it seems such small potatoes today, with the amount of the Israeli
                    debt, which was minuscule to what it is, but we were worried about it in those
                    days and we'd keep reminding them of this.</p>
                <p>I was there for the last of the Kissinger shuttle missions. And that was a big
                    and exciting time because he was trying at that time to settle the disputes
                    between Syria and Israel. He'd settled the Egyptian-Israeli one; now this was
                    the tough nut. And the Golan Heights was involved, and everything else. And back
                    and forth he would go. Back and forth. But he finally did it. He finally pulled
                    it off. It didn't mean peace, but it meant no shooting. And the armistice lines
                    were observed. And they've been observed to this day in that area. So that was
                    quite a tour de force by Henry.</p>
                <p>But I well remember the night he arrived; we were in his motorcade, driving up to
                    the Knesset in Jerusalem and being pelted with rocks. He was very unpopular
                    because the Israelis thought that he was going to give away the store. And they
                    resented it even more because they said, “You're Jewish, you can't do this to
                    us.” But Henry said he was the American secretary of state and he had to do what
                    our policy required.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>But they had to sneak us in the back door. And, even then, there were people out
                    there pelting our car with rocks. You could hear them; I was afraid one of them
                    was going to break the window, but they never did, they kept bouncing off. That
                    was exciting.</p>
                <p>And then I was there first two Vance visits.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was with the Carter administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: With the Carter administration. The first visit Vance made overseas was
                    in February of '77. So I was with the Secretary a good part of the time. He had
                    the whole first team along: Hodding Carter, of course, and Phil Habib, and Hal
                    Saunders, and many other well-known names including some of the new Carter
                    team.</p>
                <p>I think they left disappointed after the talks. Rabin was prime minister at the
                    time. Alon was the foreign minister. They expected the Israelis to offer them
                    something, on the feeling that we are now the new Democratic administration;
                    we've always been friendly to Israel; what are you going to do for us in the way
                    of peace? And the answer was: Nothing. Because we, of course, wanted them to
                    give land, that land-for-peace slogan that had been talked about back in the
                    '50s but didn't seem to mean much. And Rabin was not about to do it.</p>
                <p>He was also facing a national election coming up in a couple of months and he had
                    that very much in mind. Because Begin was watching him closely, and if he had
                    been seen to weaken, or to knuckle-under to American pressure, he would have
                    been badly defeated. As it was, he was defeated—to everybody's amazement. I
                    mean, the embassy hadn't predicted it. Not a commentator in Israel had predicted
                    it. None of the embassies that we knew there had predicted it. Nobody saw it
                    coming, but it happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at the Kissinger operation and this Vance
                        operation, were they quite different in how they operated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Well, the Kissinger operation was much more Henry-centered, you know,
                    everything went out from there. Joe Sisco and Roy Atherton were along for that
                    one. Everything went out from there, and people trembled around him. That wasn't
                    true with Vance. There was more of a collegial approach, although you always
                    knew who was in charge. But they weren't afraid to speak up. I don't say they
                    were afraid under Kissinger, but they were cautious, because they could get
                    their heads bitten off. But that didn't happen under Vance. You had the feeling
                    that the underlings had a little more leeway in what they did.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the embassy in either of the these playing much of a
                        role other than expediter? I mean, as far as saying, well, we think this
                        will fly and that won't fly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: No, the only one who got close to Kissinger when he was there was Toon,
                    and he stuck with him all the time. Toon has a way of talking to anybody like a
                    Dutch uncle. And he even did it to Henry, although as a careful Dutch uncle. He
                    did get a few points across, I think.</p>
                <p>But Toon was not particularly well liked by the Israelis because he told them
                    what he thought of them, and, you know, he wasn't buttering them up all the
                    time. His first speech there was a shocker, because he stood up before the
                    Chamber of Commerce in Tel Aviv and said, “Now you Israelis have got to begin to
                    pay your way. You've leaned on us too much, and we've got too many expenses. We
                    can't be taking care of you all.” Well, this had never been said before in
                    public. But that set the tone for his time there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've heard from others that any new boy who comes to the
                        American Embassy in Israel, particularly at the upper level as the DCM, is
                        being sized up by the Israelis to find out what his attitude is, whether
                        he's anti-Semitic, and whether he's for them or against them. Was this
                        apparent?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Every day of your life you're there it's apparent. There, a cocktail
                    party is a non-stop dialogue for an American official. He walks in and they'll
                    thrust a glass in his hand, and, from then on, he's in a corner, with fingers
                    poking at him, answering questions: “Why don't you do this? Why did you give
                    this to the Egyptians and not to us? Why doesn't your president...? Why did the
                    secretary say this yesterday?” Small talk does not exist; you get right down to
                    the nitty gritty. And, you know, you hear jokes about “Are you anti-Semitic?”
                    And then you say, “Yes, aren't you?” Well, that throws them back, you know. But,
                    underneath it all, they're watching. Well, you know, for some years, we never
                    had Jewish people on our staff there. Now during my time we did. And in some
                    cases it was difficult for them because I think they felt under great
                    pressure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering, because this is true in other countries
                        where you have people who are coming back because of relationships or
                        religion or something like that. Much more is expected of them rather than
                        being just an American representative.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Exactly. The Israelis expected that these people would be sympathetic
                    with everything they did. And they weren't. They weren't. Some of the finest
                    officers we had were Jewish, who saw the Israeli problem as it was, you
                    know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How, at that time, did you see the situation in Israel,
                        and American interest in Israel?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: I felt we had, and we have today, an interest in helping the Israelis
                    defend themselves. I think we have perhaps overloaded them with hardware at the
                    moment. They are tremendously capable and they have a wonderful military
                    machine. I think we also have been underwriting too much of their economic
                    development that we should never be doing.</p>
                <p>I well remember, back in the fall of '76, we reported to Washington that the
                    Israelis were putting two new settlements in the West Bank, where we had told
                    them we didn't want any more settlements, and where they had more or less let us
                    indicate they weren't going to put any more. We said there must be a statement
                    out of Washington that would stop these before they go beyond, because if we let
                    them get away with this, there'll be more. Dead silence for about six weeks. We
                    couldn't get an answer out of Washington. Finally, in mid-December, Bill
                    Scranton, our representative to the UN, made a statement saying that we do not
                    approve of new settlements. But that was all. It wasn't given much publicity. It
                    wasn't as though the president had said something in a news conference, or the
                    secretary had said something, or there had been a wire, or a letter. Not at all.
                    A rather bland statement to that effect. And, as a result, the Israelis said:
                    “Green light.” And you see what's happened today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you and maybe other professional Foreign Service
                        officers feel that the Israeli lobby in the United States was jerking us
                        around a lot? I mean, was there resentment of this feeling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Well, I think we had those symptoms plus an admiration for their skill
                    and ability for doing it. I never met so many senators and congressmen in my
                    life as I did in those years in Israel. They kept coming through week after
                    week. And not only senators and congressmen, but labor delegations, governors,
                    important mayors. The Israelis knew how to handle people and what to show them
                    and so forth. And they got a lot of sympathy and a lot of support from it. There
                    are no holds barred in taking care of influential visitors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what about reporting of things like, say, what's
                        happening on the West Bank and all? This was before it came really to the
                        top of the agenda. But was there a problem, a feeling about what you could
                        report and what you couldn't report because of what would happen back in
                        Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: We at the embassy, you see, didn't do that. That was done by our consul
                    general in Jerusalem. Now the consul general in Jerusalem was never recognized
                    by the Israeli government. In fact, I was called up once by the director general
                    of political affairs, later ambassador here, who complained about our consulate
                    general there, saying, “Some of these Palestinians said, 'We don't like that, we
                    think you shouldn't have it here.'”</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>I said, “That is our policy, you know, we don't recognize your going to
                    Jerusalem. That still remains open and to be settled.”</p>
                <p>So we agreed to disagree on that, but he made it quite plain to me that he didn't
                    accept our view. I told the consul general. Later, he met this fellow. They are
                    both decent people, but they, again, couldn't agree. We had to make sure that
                    the consul general was uninhibited in making his contacts. And he was. In those
                    days, he pretty much could get around, and people could come in to the consulate
                    general to see him. And many did, from around the West Bank, with various
                    stories—none of them, of course, nearly as bad as they are now—but stories of
                    injustice and discrimination and things of that nature, and Americans of
                    Palestinian descent who were ill-treated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you get these reports from our consul general and
                        then go make a complaint to the Foreign Ministry or something like that from
                        time to time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Generally, in that case, we'd wait until Washington wanted us to do it.
                    Because it wasn't good for us to say “Our consul general has told us...”
                    Because, technically, you see, the ambassador wasn't to have any say over the
                    consul general. Practically, he did, but in international law, he didn't. And
                    the Israelis were well aware of that, because we kept insisting this was a
                    separate entity that was credited through Jerusalem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And so you would receive a directive from Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Washington would say, “Now, look, this is going too far. Go in and tell
                    the Foreign Ministry some of their thugs have beat up an American citizen.”
                    Then, of course, you could do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there an inhibition on reporting on affairs in Israel
                        because of the concern about leaks to Congress or to the newspapers once it
                        got back to Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Not that I ever felt or noticed in the embassy. No, I think our people
                    were pretty good that way. We were all aware of the situation, but I don't think
                    that ever inhibited us from doing anything. I don't think of any circumstance
                    where it would have.</p>
                <p>Some of the congressional visits get a little dicey at times, you know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would they get dicey?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Some of them indicate to the Israelis that our policy is much more in
                    their favor than it really is, you see. And then one had to gently correct the
                    congressman, or get the impression to the Israelis. And then the Israelis would
                    say, “Hah! You people at the embassy, you know, we know what Congress really
                    thinks now, because Senator So and So told us that.” And Senator So and So may
                    want this for his newsletter at home, for his purposes, but that isn't US
                    government policy, you know. And little things like that.</p>
                <p>I had a very interesting case once. A very distinguished American labor
                    delegation came over, and they came to the embassy for a briefing. I was charg�
                    at the time, and we trotted out all our political, economic, public affairs
                    counselors, our military attach�, and whoever, and briefed them. I sort of
                    kicked it off and summed it up at the end. And one of the labor leaders, a
                    distinguished black gentleman who was well known in American labor circles,
                    since dead, then got up and accused me of being anti-Israel. He said, “All of
                    you, and you particularly, you sound like you're anti-Israel! You're not in
                    favor of these people!”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Well, Mr. So and So, we try to call the shots as we see them in the
                    interests of the US government. I don't think any of us are anti-Israel. In
                    fact, I think we're quite friendly to this country. But that doesn't mean we
                    have to agree with everything they do.”</p>
                <p>He said, “It's plain to me that none of you people like Israel. You don't
                    understand what they've done and what they're doing.”</p>
                <p>Well, there are some people you're not going to convince. Now he was not Jewish,
                    he was black, but he had been co-opted and felt very strongly that all of us
                    were opposed to the Israelis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find that in a subtle way the Israeli
                        government—the Foreign Ministry but others—would sort of foster this thing
                        about co-opting people but also making them feel that the embassy was the
                        problem, when obviously it was policy and it was not the embassy? Was this
                        being used?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: I don't have any direct evidence of that, Stu. I'd be surprised if some
                    of it didn't happen. I'd be surprised if some of it didn't, because the ties are
                    so close between many people in this country and Israel, you know. And
                    communications daily, telephonic, everything, back and forth, visits. I'd be
                    surprised if it didn't.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tom, what about the difference that you saw of the
                        operating style between Toon, which you've talked about, and Sam Lewis? Did
                        you have much time with Sam Lewis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: I had about three months with him. Sam had already picked his DCM.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Dick Viets. He brought Dick Viets on. Sam was very much smoother than
                    Toon. Sam was much more attuned to the desires of the Carter administration, how
                    they saw policy. He had come from being assistant secretary for international
                    organization, and so he was very well wired-in, and he knew what would play in
                    Washington and what wouldn't. But he had a nicer way, a smoother way, of
                    approaching the Israeli leaders, so they liked him instinctively. Whereas
                    there's a certain rectitude and Scottish bristliness about Toon that often sets
                    people off on the wrong tangent. But Sam was totally different, and, as a
                    result, they welcomed him warmly, they opened up to him.</p>
                <p>He got there, you see, just at the beginning of the Begin administration, so he
                    was moving in, he wasn't with the old team. In fact, he'd wanted to come about a
                    week before the election, but we asked him not to because, we said, “Our posture
                    is so high here (the American) that if you come before, they'll say the US
                    government tried to favor Rabin. You know, they're bringing this man over at the
                    last moment to help him out.” And he saw the wisdom of that, and so he came the
                    day after. But, as a result, he was not committed to anything the Rabin
                    government ever did; he worked with Begin all the time.</p>
                <p>Then, in the few days I was there with Sam, was the second Vance visit. And I
                    don't think that went much better than the first, although I don't know.</p>
                <p>But then Sam's greatest moments, I think, came in the following year during the
                    Camp David bit, when he played quite a key role in getting them together. I had
                    been gone by that time, but I looked back with great interest to what was going
                    on, because that was a tremendous breakthrough.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there when Begin was elected, and you say this
                        was a surprise. What was the general judgment of our embassy when Begin came
                        in? What did this mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Well, I was the first senior American diplomat to ever have Begin in my
                    house, and this happened months before the election. When we heard he was
                    nominated, I said, “None of us seem to know him, I'm going to ask him out for
                    dinner.” He had not gone out to a diplomatic dinner in years, but he accepted. I
                    was then the charg�. And, in fact, I had planned this dinner to say farewell to
                    my German colleague, the DCM of the German Embassy, who was leaving. And when
                    Begin said he'd come, I called him and said to his secretary, “Look, I want Mr.
                    Begin to know that I'm having a German there, Mr. Helmut Brukweil. I want you to
                    tell him that just in case it means anything.” The answer came back: “Mr. Begin
                    would be pleased to come.” And I learned it was the first he had talked to a
                    German since 1944.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good God!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: But he came and he was very much a gentleman, a courtly gentleman,
                    kissing hands, very friendly. He and his wife are delightful people, and we
                    liked them. It was a small group of about ten or twelve, and I had a thoroughly
                    good time. And then I'd see him during the course of the election campaign. He
                    stayed pretty close to home; he was already then a little old and infirm. Ezer
                    Weizman was running his campaign, doing a magnificent job. He put him over. But
                    Begin would receive me at the house, and I'd go down and talk to him about an
                    hour and get his views, report them. So we had an in with him before, and then
                    Sam, of course, just kept rolling right along.</p>
                <p>I liked Begin personally. I didn't agree with many of his policies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But did we see trouble with Begin and his party coming in,
                        the Likud?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Not really at the beginning. We didn't see much because they'd never
                    been in power, we didn't know what to expect. We knew that they were composed of
                    very disparate groups, many right-wing, former terrorists. None Socialist, and
                    that was welcome in some ways in the Washington side, you know. You remember
                    that crew. No, we didn't know what to expect for quite a while.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Tom, I know that we're under a time constraint, so I
                        just want to say that we are going to stop here rather than covering your
                        time in The Hague as DCM from '78 to '81.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Which was very interesting, in fact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And from '83 to '84 in the OAS.</hi>

                <p>DUNNIGAN: If you ever want ten more minutes, I'll...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, well, come on by sometime and we'll see.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: All right, Stu, I'd like to. Those things are a little more clear in my
                    mind, and it would be more interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, why don't we hold off until then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: All right, when you have a free afternoon or morning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the second interview to conclude our interview
                        with Tom Dunnigan. Today is December 7, 1990. Tom, I think the last time we
                        had you, from '75 to '77, in Tel Aviv. Was there anything else that you, in
                        retrospect, wanted to talk about in Israel? It's always been one of our
                        major posts as far as our policy concerns there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Israel is a place you can talk about at great length. The
                    interrelationship we have is such that almost anything that happens in this
                    country is mirrored, and in fact magnified, in Israel. And that has an effect on
                    what anybody can do in the field of diplomacy there. The Israelis are extremely
                    well wired-in in this country. And, in fact, at times one often feels there that
                    the real business is taking place here in Washington, and that the embassy in
                    Tel Aviv is following on policy that is agreed in other places. That may not
                    always be true, but it makes life a little difficult.</p>
                <p>It's an exciting post in that there is a frontline feeling always in Israel.
                    Relaxation is not the key to the day there. The Israelis will point out that
                    it's only a few miles from the West Bank to the sea, and they say they live in
                    constant fear of being driven into the sea. But one wonders, given the size and
                    power of their military structure, whether this would be possible. It seems
                    unlikely that they could be conquered militarily, although demographically their
                    position is not strong.</p>
                <p>Beyond that, unless there are specific questions...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I tell you, one question that I think that works
                        with everybody who is not Jewish...I assume, from your name of Dunnigan,
                        that you're not Jewish, is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And my name is Kennedy, and I actually don't have any
                        Jewish stock in me. When I think about the problems of Israel, again as a
                        professional Foreign Service officer, I find myself continually examining
                        myself to say I hope I'm not being anti-Semitic when I'm thinking about this
                        is a small country, it is driving our foreign policy counter to many of our
                        interests in the world. I mean, this is a great inhibitor. Although I have
                        German blood in me, the German blood doesn't bother me the slightest bit
                        about worrying about am I being anti-German or anti-Japanese when I think
                        about those countries. But when you get to Israel, you all of a sudden find
                        yourself caught in this feeling am I being truly liberal? Am I being truly
                        unanti-Semitic or something? I mean, did you find this a factor in your
                        thinking in how one deals with the problem there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: It's always there, Stu, I think, in anyone who's not Jewish, if you are
                    living in a state that is a proclaimed theocratic Jewish state. And, as you
                    know, for many years it was the unspoken policy of the State Department not to
                    assign Jewish officers to the embassy in Tel Aviv. That was broken shortly
                    before I arrived, and we did have officers of the Jewish faith on the staff. And
                    they behaved like American Foreign Service officers should behave. Although, of
                    course, they may have been closer, in some ways, culturally to some of the
                    people they were dealing with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did have problems, though, of pressures about people
                        saying, well, what are you doing, you should... I mean, because there is so
                        much of this loyalty. I mean, the feeling of return and all. There must have
                        been more pressure on them. Did they feel it, or did you get
                        emanations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: There was that pressure, and they did feel it. And, in almost all
                    cases, they resisted. Some of the officers who did the most valuable work we had
                    there were officers of the Jewish faith. I don't think we should have our
                    embassy overweighted in that regard. But, you know, when you look at it, the
                    basic language that the Israeli government uses is Hebrew, and that's the
                    language of the press, and that's the language that the people talk on the
                    streets. And we have to have Hebrew language officers. There is an affinity of
                    Jewish people for the Hebrew language, so it's only natural that we would
                    probably have more Hebrew language applicants who are Jewish than who are
                    non-Jewish. In a sense, it limits the posts that one can have, because Hebrew is
                    only useful in Israel. And that, I think, will always give us an influx of
                    officers of the Jewish faith merely because they will learn Hebrew.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We had somewhat the same thing when I was in Athens, with
                        Greek. And there it was a problem, not because we...I mean, there was too
                        close or...coming culturally. And I don't think there was the feeling that
                        you were a frontline state where I think you were more on your guard; I
                        think there was more of an assimilation process and enjoyment. There have
                        been Greek-extract officers who fought it like mad, but there have been
                        others who've become a little bit more Catholic than the Pope in this. This
                        is particularly true, I think, in our military when you have sort of a
                        strong military mission, which caused us some problems, at least when I was
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: That was true in Israel, too. Our military in a sense, although none of
                    them were Jewish that I knew of, became more closely identified with the Israeli
                    cause than the embassy. But that, I think, is congenital.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This has been true in Korea and other places, too. Well,
                        then, Tom, you left Tel Aviv and you went then to The Hague.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Yes, I had one year in between as a diplomat-in-residence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: I was at Center College of Kentucky.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good heavens!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: A fascinating place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if you'd give a little feel for what it was like
                        coming from the diplomacy field and all this, and all of a sudden in Center
                        College, Kentucky.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Frankly, about all I knew of Center College before I went there was
                    that they had won a famous football game over Harvard in 1921, when Harvard was
                    one of the top football powers and Center was the Praying Colonels, a very small
                    college in the center of Kentucky. But, when I got there, I found out that
                    Center was a minor powerhouse in its own right in the academic field. It was a
                    small college of about 800 students, which was the second-oldest college in
                    Kentucky, had existed since 1819, had a number of Rhodes Scholars, a vice
                    president, a number of chief justices of the Supreme Court among its graduates,
                    and its entering classes always had the highest SAT scores in the State of
                    Kentucky. It was proud of its academic tradition. It had been affiliated until
                    1959 with the Presbyterian Church, but then became disestablished. And now has
                    the highest percentage of alumni-giving of any college in the United States. It
                    was fourth or fifth when I was there, but in recent years it's gone up because
                    of the faithfulness of its alumni.</p>
                <p>I was treated generously there, was well received; they were delighted to have a
                    representative from the department and somebody who'd served abroad. Not only
                    was I at Center, but I was also allowed and urged to roam freely around the
                    region. So I was at schools in Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee, as well as in Kentucky.
                    And I enjoyed the year tremendously.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Much of the fallout from Vietnam had taken place, but what
                        was the reaction you had as a Foreign Service officer, here in mid-America,
                        the type of questions that were asked of you and interest in American
                        diplomacy and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: You mentioned Vietnam, and I was very interested in that problem myself
                    at the time, assuming that I would be bombarded with criticism by students and
                    so forth. Not at all. The students never asked a question about Vietnam; they
                    did not seem concerned.</p>
                <p>It was the younger faculty who were hung-up on Vietnam, none of whom had really
                    served in the military, most of whom were getting their graduate degrees during
                    the years of Vietnam. In my view, it was almost a guilty conscience that many of
                    them had. They didn't raise the subject very often, but, when it did come up,
                    you could tell that they were uneasy with their position.</p>
                <p>But not the students. The students, frankly, were not overly interested in
                    foreign affairs. I've noticed in recent years writers talking about apathy on
                    campuses, and I think I was beginning to see it then, in '77, '78.</p>
                <p>At that time, one of the hot issues was ratification of the Panama Canal Treaty.
                    And there were certain voices in central Kentucky that believed, as, well,
                    Governor Reagan believed at the time, that this was a tragedy and we shouldn't
                    do it. And they spoke in that vein. We were successful in getting that through,
                    but, deep down inside, there is a suspicion that we were giving away too
                    much.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>The other issues at the time, of course, while our relations with the Soviet
                    Union were frozen, there wasn't much new one could say about that. And the
                    people seemed to be well aware of it; the students had all been brought up in
                    the Cold-War atmosphere. I think some of them were restless under it, but they
                    didn't quite know what to do and where one could go from here.</p>
                <p>Beyond that, I would say there was as much an interest in Latin America as any
                    other place at the time. Students in Center frequently would travel. They had
                    each year a travel program to the Soviet Union, led by one of the professors
                    there, a bright young Sovietologist. They had trips to France and England. And,
                    in subsequent years, they've had them to the antiquities of Greece, Egypt, and
                    the Holy Land. So, in that regard, they are not sitting on their hands by any
                    means.</p>
                <p>The students there generally are later going into law or business, local
                    government, medicine. None of which they'll get at Center, which has only the
                    liberal arts curriculum. They go on then to graduate school. And they become
                    leaders in the state, certainly in the State of Kentucky, and a number of other
                    neighboring states.</p>
                <p>So it was a rewarding year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then, in 1978, after that year, you went to The Hague, is
                        that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: For the second time, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And how did you get that job, and what were you doing
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Well, one day at Center College, I got a call from my personnel guru in
                    the department who said that President Carter had named a new ambassador to The
                    Hague. And this was Gerri Joseph, who had been a Democratic Committeewoman from
                    Minnesota, a newspaperwoman who had been vice chairman of the Humphrey campaign
                    in '68. She wanted to interview some candidates because the DCM was scheduled to
                    leave—would I be interested? And I said, “Yes.”</p>
                <p>So I went to Washington and was interviewed by Mrs. Joseph. I think there were
                    five or six candidates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to give a little feel for this, how would you
                        characterize it? What type of questions were asked? What did she seem to be
                        interested in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: I was very impressed. I don't know if you've met Ambassador Joseph, but
                    she's an attractive woman, poised, who knows exactly what she wants to get from
                    you but has a very pleasant and nice manner of doing it. For instance, she had a
                    series of questions she asked, and a pad on which she made notes, and she asked
                    me about my background in the Foreign Service; about what I thought of the
                    Netherlands, having served there before; would I have difficulty working for a
                    woman; what did I think the role of an ambassador was in a country like the
                    Netherlands; how would she relate to the other American entities in-country; and
                    so forth. Those were the sorts of questions that I remember now, and I was
                    surprised—they were good questions, and ones that someone coming in from the
                    outside who's never been in the field should ask. We didn't go deeply into Dutch
                    politics or anything, because I knew she'd be briefed by the desk on all of
                    that. And she had a good deal of reading to do, and she did it all. But I was
                    very impressed. I left there not knowing, of course, what the result would be.
                    She said that she would consider it and I would learn later.</p>
                <p>Well, I guess it was within a month, I was called and told that I'd been
                    selected. And I was very pleased with that, and I thought at the time that she'd
                    be interesting to work for. And intelligent woman, with few, if any,
                    hangups.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to give an idea to somebody reading this, what would
                        someone, like Ambassador Joseph, without an international-experience
                        background do to get ready? Do you know how she got ready to go to her
                        post?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Well, I know she read as much as she could about the country. And then
                    she went around and interviewed the previous ambassadors and talked to them
                    about some of the problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's very interesting. I mean, so seldom is that
                        done.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Yes, and talked to them and was advised by them. And I think they were
                    flattered by it, you know, that she wanted their advise. But she's that sort of
                    person: intelligent enough to understand what she doesn't know and how to get
                    it. You could only admire that in her.</p>
                <p>So she came well prepared, was well received by the Dutch, and her predecessor,
                    Ambassador Bob McCloskey, had been well liked, of course. But she brought
                    something different there, and they weren't quite sure what to make out of her
                    at first because the Dutch are not great on women ambassadors. But she quickly
                    won them over, won a good relationship with the prime minister, with the leader
                    of the opposition, with the trade union leader and businessmen throughout the
                    country. So, as a result, she turned out, in my book, to have been a resounding
                    success.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived, did you both sit down and say, well,
                        these are the outstanding problems and how do we go about this? Or was it
                        more at that point a maintaining of good relations period? Or did you have
                        some problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: I had no problems. My predecessor, Elizabeth Brown, was an old friend
                    and she briefed me. And I had about a three-week overlap with her, which was
                    about a month before Ambassador Joseph arrived, so I had several weeks in charge
                    there before she did. I was familiar with the embassy, having been there before,
                    so we had little difficulty getting started.</p>
                <p>I did the normal thing: I told her that she should call on certain people, start
                    with the chief of protocol who'll arrange a call on this and that, that she
                    would be presenting her credentials to the queen at a later date, and so forth.
                    Meanwhile, we arranged calls, and then she would have to go through the
                    rigmarole of calling on all the other ambassadors. She took that with good humor
                    and made friends out of almost all of them. And she assiduously made her
                    calls.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, she was reading the traffic. I screened some of the things and sent
                    her what I thought were the important items to be looked at, and she would go
                    over them. And she took an interest in everything going on in the embassy. Some
                    ambassadors, you know, have only an interest in political or economic or
                    military affairs. Not Ambassador Joseph, she was on top of it all and was
                    helpful to others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had she brought management skills with her, did you
                        find?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Oh, yes, she was very good at that. She ran the embassy beautifully,
                    with a light but firm hand. She needed little coaching in that. She had been in
                    public life for many years. She'd served on a commission, something to do with
                    education, I believe, appointed by Lyndon Johnson, you know. So she had been in
                    and out of Washington and she knew how large organizations functioned.</p>
                <p>Her staff meetings were well run. The consuls general from Rotterdam and
                    Amsterdam would come, and the head of the Coast Guard contingent in Rotterdam,
                    and others. And she invited the commander of our air base at Soesterberg, which
                    is a fighter base, and had them come once a month to her staff
                    meetings—country-team meetings being held in between times—but they were
                    delighted to come. And so she had a good feeling.</p>
                <p>She also got out a lot and spoke, which we urged on her.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have any issues with the Dutch at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: We certainly did. The big issue was the GLCMs, the ground-launched
                    cruise missiles, part of the short-range nucleus of what we wanted to put into
                    Holland. There were strong feelings on that. We wanted to put them in both
                    Holland and Belgium. Well, these countries were very skittish. They both had
                    strong antiwar movements, and there were lingering suspicions of the US in
                    Holland as the result of Vietnam, of course, and other things, and also the
                    feeling of Mr. Big pushing Mr. Small around, and the whole thing. So we had to
                    behave carefully on it. But she walked it skillfully through; dealt with the
                    prime minister, Van Agt, closely on it; won his sympathy and his support. And we
                    were very pleased that in December of '79 the Dutch Parliament accepted the
                    missiles. It was a close vote, but they accepted them. That was one of the
                    biggest things we had going at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tom, you were saying it was interesting about how
                        Ambassador Joseph got her job. I wonder if you could go into that a little
                        more.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Well, as I understand, as I recall she told me this, after the Carter
                    administration came in, they began to make appointments domestically and to our
                    embassies abroad. And the new vice president, Mr. Mondale, apparently complained
                    gently to the White House (or perhaps not so gently), saying, “Look, it's all
                    very fine, but none of my people are being appointed.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were obviously mostly from Minnesota.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Yes, and mostly friends of Carter's were being appointed. So he said,
                    “I'd like to appoint some of my friends.” And he was told subsequently that he
                    could have two appointments: one to Norway, where his ancestors came from; and
                    one to the Netherlands, because we needed an ambassador there. He picked one for
                    Norway, and then he decided that, well, Gerri Joseph would be a good candidate
                    to go to Holland. Well, she had always worked domestically, and so she was quite
                    surprised when he told her, but the more she heard about it, the more it
                    intrigued her. And that's how she got it; she was one of his two candidates.</p>
                <p>And a footnote to that is that when the vice president was coming to Europe on a
                    visit to Norway, and to all of the Scandinavian countries, as I recall, she
                    wrote him and said, “Dear Fritz, you've got to come to the Netherlands. You've
                    sent me here; they're doing a great job; and it'll help us push through the GLCM
                    program, among other things.” I didn't see the letter, but I understand it was a
                    letter along those lines.</p>
                <p>Well, you know how difficult it is to change presidential or vice presidential
                    travel schedules.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, oh yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: But her clout with him was such that he told his staff he wanted to go
                    to the Netherlands. And so he spent two days there. It was a triumph for her,
                    because he could relate to the people of the Netherlands. His liberal outlook
                    was such that they admired him from the beginning. He said all the right things,
                    met the right people, and his visit was quite a success.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He came to Naples when I was there. This was after he left
                        office. But a very fast study and very interested in the history. I mean, a
                        very inquiring mind.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: As a result, we got a lot of good out of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did she use you as a DCM?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: This is a very interesting question. She let me, in a sense, run most
                    branches of the embassy, coordinate them, make sure the reports were out, that
                    we were hitting the high spots, bringing to her the problems that required her
                    attention.</p>
                <p>So much of what a DCM does now, it seems to me, is super-administrative work:
                    getting-in required reports each year, how many bodies there are, what the
                    budget is going to be, working with the administrative officer on these things.
                    But also he has to be fully in tune with the political and economic counselors,
                    with what the military is doing. We had always important military problems with
                    the Dutch. She wanted me to stay on top of all those.</p>
                <p>And I would sign-out routine telegrams, in fact most telegrams, sending in to her
                    only those that I thought she would certainly want to see. And we almost never
                    had a breakdown in that arrangement. Perhaps I erred in the sense of sending her
                    too much at times, but she was a workaholic and she would take it.</p>
                <p>I did not sit-in on all her meetings with staff members. Sometimes I thought it
                    was better if they'd talk to her one-on-one on things. They'd talk to me; they
                    should talk to her. And this happened.</p>
                <p>We had occasional personal problems, personnel problems. And she handled those
                    quite well, removing people who had to be removed. Which was hard for her to do
                    because she's very empathetic, but she would understand the necessity of it.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you feel at that time about our having a

                        a hoot and a holler away. And we had three—The Hague, Amsterdam, and
                        Rotterdam—right in a very small country.</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the rationale, and how did you objectively feel
                        about it at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Of course, you can't be in Holland without noticing the things you
                    mentioned. But I would add, also, that all those posts were opened in the 18th
                    century, and there's tradition behind them.</p>
                <p>Now Rotterdam, which seemed the most vulnerable because it was less than thirty
                    miles from The Hague, was the largest port in the world. We shipped more grain
                    there and we sold more grain to Holland than any other country in the world.
                    More agricultural produce than into any country except Canada. So it was a
                    tremendous market of ours, and we had great business interests in Holland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this would also be a tie between Ambassador Joseph,
                        coming from the grain area, there, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Not only that, but her husband was a grain trader, you see, with a
                    business in Rotterdam. And she had to be very careful about conflict of
                    interest. She told me that this required some weeks back in Washington to get
                    that straightened out.</p>
                <p>But that was one of the reasons we had a post at Rotterdam.</p>
                <p>Secondly, we had a large Coast Guard set-up there. The Coast Guard office for
                    northern Europe is in Rotterdam. And there were the usual protection and
                    welfare, visa cases and so forth—the normal consular work.</p>
                <p>Amsterdam is different. Amsterdam is the capital city of the Netherlands,
                    although the government sits in The Hague. The queen's palace is in Amsterdam,
                    although she doesn't reside there very often. Amsterdam is a larger city, it's
                    farther from The Hague, it's the scene of the international airport, Schiphol
                    Airport, there.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>So, when the time came to close posts (and that, fortunately, was after I left),
                    Rotterdam was closed and Amsterdam was kept open, and all of the consular work
                    in the country was transferred to Amsterdam. I believe The Hague now is a minor
                    consular section, which we did not have before. I'm not sure how it's working; I
                    haven't had enough feedback on that yet. The Rotterdam consular local staff were
                    transferred, I understand, to Amsterdam, while continuing to live in Rotterdam,
                    and this is not really their idea of a...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Probably a transitional phase.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Yes, I think there's a transitional phase till they retire and so
                    forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Amsterdam? I remember, in the early '80s, the
                        continual series of demonstrations against the United States. I mean,
                        Amsterdam seems to have almost a floating group of antis—our consulate
                        general was almost under siege by many of these people—and a very tolerant
                        attitude towards demonstrations on the part of the Dutch. Was this a problem
                        when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Always. In my two tours, from '69 to '72, and from '78 to '81, it was a
                    problem. In the early tour, it was a group called the Provos, who were restless
                    young people with painted faces and wild hairdos and...perhaps an anarchist
                    outlook on life would be the way to describe it. And, of course, we were in
                    Vietnam at the time and we were the enemy. We were also siding with the wrong
                    people in the Nigerian conflict with Biafra, in their view. We had nothing to
                    offer them, nothing to teach them. In fact, in their view, it would have been
                    better if we had got out. And they showed that and said it and so forth.</p>
                <p>Later, the Provos had disappeared, largely, but they had been succeeded by larger
                    groups—less structured but just as unpleasant and dangerous, in some ways, to
                    our interests.</p>
                <p>And I think you put your finger on it, Stu, when you mentioned the word
                    “tolerant.” The Dutch are overly tolerant. Anything goes, as we used to say
                    there, and this would infuriate us at times. It was true that our consulate
                    general in Amsterdam was under siege, I believe at least twice, in my time
                    there. So it was difficult. And there were mobs frequently marching by it,
                    denouncing us and threatening us—for imagined slights. If it wasn't a racial
                    slight, it was our behavior in Central America, which was looming larger when I
                    was there the second time, or our association with dictators in other parts of
                    the world, which ostensibly offended the Dutch sensibilities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say the “Dutch sensibilities,” was this basically
                        a small segment, or was this a significant segment with an activist tip?
                        Were they reflecting a Dutch spirit towards the United States at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Unfortunately, I think it was a growing spirit. All you'll have to do
                    is watch the several Dutch television channels to notice this, because they're
                    controlled largely by people who think along these lines. And several of the
                    Dutch newspapers are, too. A newspaper that would be considered quite
                    conservative on the Dutch scene would be considered very liberal in this
                    country. It seeped into the body politic, into the social groupings, into the
                    Catholic Church—it's very evident there, they've had real problems. But it's an
                    atmosphere that's grown up in the last thirty years, I would say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, not just the power structure in the Netherlands, but
                        beyond that, in general society, were there reflections of anti-Americanism
                        that you saw there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: During my first tour there, one of our junior political officers went
                    out to meet with a group of students at Leiden University, which is one of the
                    most famous universities there. He said he sat down, they sat around a table,
                    and they said, “What do you want here? We have nothing to do with America and we
                    don't want anything to do with you. We've got nothing to say to you.” And that
                    was the attitude of students back in 1970.</p>
                <p>I can't say it had improved greatly ten years later. We were listened to,
                    occasionally, politely, and occasionally not so politely.</p>
                <p>Of course, you had a generation difference, too, there. Those who remembered
                    World War II, the Marshall Plan, what we'd done for them after the great floods
                    in '53 were very inclined to be pro-American and helpful. But it was the younger
                    generation that was coming on, that is taking over the country, that was raised
                    under different circumstances and has different attitudes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the time you were there, was there a feeling that this
                        meant worsening relations with the United States as this generation came up?
                        Or was the feeling, well, at a certain point these kids are going to grow up
                        and become more conservative? How did you feel about it at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: We hoped for the latter, but I don't think any of us were very certain
                    it was going to happen. Not at all certain, in fact. Worrisome times.</p>
                <p>It doesn't meant that the Dutch are not going to be allies in certain
                    circumstances. They are. They've always proved to be staunch allies and good
                    fighters. But there will be certain other things about us, socially, that they
                    don't like.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were talking about the tolerance. I had an interview
                        not too long ago with Ambassador Nicholas Veliotes, who at one time was
                        brought back and was dealing with problems in Personnel. This was in sort of
                        the earlier part of trying to deal with what is now called the gay problem
                        of the homosexuals. This was, I guess, in the early '70s, and we had been
                        refusing to have homosexuals in the Foreign Service. But it looked like
                        there were court decisions that this no longer could be done. So, with the
                        Foreign Service, where do you assign them? And they were talking about
                        having what were known as sort of homosexual posts. I mean, this was in the
                        thinking side, and obviously Amsterdam, Stockholm, Copenhagen were ones of
                        them. But, I mean, this was part of the atmosphere. Did you have problems,
                        not just homosexuals, but bisexuals, whatever you want to talk about it,
                        problems with the staff in this very tolerant atmosphere? I mean, was this
                        people run wild?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: No, that was not a problem during my time there. I can't think of any
                    particular cases. We had some alcoholic problems, but those are endemic to
                    posts.</p>
                <p>One of the big things that was going on, particularly in my second tour, was the
                    drug problem. And we had a very large DEA contingent there, Amsterdam being one
                    of the centers for it. In my first tour, in '69 to '72, the Dutch told us that
                    was an American problem: any drugs had been introduced by American soldiers from
                    Germany, and the Dutch had no problem. They were a little more honest ten years
                    later, they realized they had a major—and a growing—problem in Amsterdam. And
                    not only in Amsterdam; Rotterdam, The Hague, it was all over, widespread. And,
                    again, the tolerant attitude had led them to allow drugs, just as they allow
                    prostitution, pornography, everything else. Anything will go, because you can't
                    forbid it, is the Dutch attitude. And I'm sure homosexuality is included there,
                    too. That would be tolerated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what about Americans getting into trouble because of
                        drugs? Was this a major problem for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Occasionally it was. Too often soldiers coming over on leave from units
                    in Germany would end up getting in trouble, but the military would take care of
                    them pretty well. I think, yes, there were the usual consular problems. Of
                    course, a lot of people come: “Whoopee! I'm in Amsterdam, I can do anything I
                    want,” you know. Well, they can and they can't—the police aren't always as
                    tolerant as some of society is about things. So, yes, there were cases, but I
                    wouldn't say anything out of the ordinary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just one final question on this. Obviously, Germany was
                        our major NATO ally, and the Dutch and the Germans, particularly since World
                        War II, had certainly had their difficulties. Did you have a problem
                        balancing our closeness to the Germans in this growing estrangement, as you
                        were talking about, with the younger generation and others in the
                        Netherlands?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: No, we didn't have to, for this reason: economics did it for us. The
                    Dutch saw that their markets are so tied to Germany, which is their largest
                    market, that, while they personally are not fond of Germany for historic
                    reasons, they would have to get along. And they were, after all, getting along
                    very well in the Common Market as they did in NATO. I mentioned earlier that
                    Holland took more grain from us than any country in the world, but most of that,
                    you see, was for transshipment up the Rhine to Germany and Switzerland, mainly
                    to Germany, so it was very important to them to maintain good relations with the
                    Germans. The Dutch guilder is tied to the German mark, which makes it a very
                    hard currency. All of those relationships drive them together, when the
                    chemistry is not always very good between the two and the Dutch would just as
                    soon do without the Germans. But, still, thousands and thousands of Germans pour
                    into Holland each year on vacation to use the beaches, and this tempts the Dutch
                    in another direction. So it's, I would almost say, a necessity-hate
                    relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, is there anything else, any other problems or issues
                        that you dealt with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Let me think...the big ones were always trade issues. We were trying to
                    get more American products there. Mrs. Joseph was very good at that, attending a
                    trade fair; she was familiar with business from knowing her husband's business.
                    We were successful in some ways. The Dutch have tremendous investments in the
                    U.S., as you know. When we were in Holland, they were the second-largest
                    investors, after the British, in the United States. I think now they've been
                    surpassed by the Japanese and perhaps by the Canadians, but they are still
                    fourth or fifth in the world in the amount of money they have in this country,
                    so they have a great interest in what's going on here. And we were continually
                    urging them to buy more of our products. They do buy a lot now, but they could
                    always buy more.</p>
                <p>Agriculture seemed to take care of itself. They were a tremendous market for
                    soybeans and grain for us, mainly for transshipment, but the things were
                    processed there in Rotterdam and considered as imports into Holland. Rotterdam
                    is the busiest port in the world, so that meant there were always American and
                    other ships there, including Cuban, and that kept us on the qui vivre at
                    times.</p>
                <p>We had naval visits frequently, because Holland is a seafaring nation and the big
                    seaports are there.</p>
                <p>The Dutch permission to put the GLCMs was very important to us.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Joseph arrived just shortly after the fiasco of what was called the neutron
                    bomb.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, could you explain what that was.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Well, the neutron bomb was a form of expended uranium put inside our
                    artillery shell that, when it was exploded in a confined area, was lethal to
                    everything involved. Without damaging much of the surroundings, in a tank or in
                    a house or a building it could kill everything within.</p>
                <p>It was considered a very advanced, a very desirable, weapon by our military in
                    the mid-seventies, and our desire was to introduce it into the NATO arsenal.
                    Most of the NATO military people thought it was a good idea.</p>
                <p>But, unfortunately, we think it was handled ineptly. Rather than introducing it
                    through the military, President Carter decided that, because it contained a
                    nuclear element, we would have to get the political approval of the governments
                    involved.</p>
                <p>Well, I needn't tell you what happened...the opposition party seized on this as
                    the American desire to have them burned alive, cremated, and so forth. And,
                    besides, the Americans were more interested in killing people and saving
                    property. They always thought we were capitalists at heart, and so forth and so
                    on. And, as a result, the Dutch, among other governments, said they wouldn't
                    accept the neutron weapon on their territory.</p>
                <p>And this was a lingering problem when Mrs. Joseph went in to begin the talks
                    about ground-launched cruise missiles—only a few months after the decision, by
                    the way. That had taken place before she arrived, but still it was lingering on,
                    it was a problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then the election came along, I guess, of 1980.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: The election came along in 1980, yes. Mrs. Joseph and I parted company
                    then, in the sense that of course she was a very strong supporter of the
                    Carter-Mondale ticket, and I kept quiet and she knew that I was not for that
                    slate. She was disappointed in the outcome. I had a frank talk with her and told
                    her that she would be expected to submit her resignation. And she wrote out a
                    very gracious resignation letter, sent it in, and came back to Washington in
                    January. The new secretary of state, Secretary Haig, said he'd like to see her.
                    She'd known him when he was in Europe. Well, she went in and had a very nice
                    talk with him, and she told me later that she left there feeling that she might
                    be retained. But 'twas not to be, you know, and she eventually left in early
                    March and was replaced the first of September.</p>
                <p>So there was a hiatus there. She, however, comes back frequently to Holland and
                    was there, I know, a few months ago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you leave?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: I left at the end of August.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you brief the new ambassador? Was there a new
                        ambassador before you left?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Bill Dyess came, I believe it was the 27th of August, and I left the
                    29th. We had a few hours together, and I gave him the highlights of what I
                    could. We left, of course, some written material for him. The new DCM had just
                    arrived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were both professionals.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Both professionals, and I thought it was time to go. I don't think a
                    DCM should stay around very long under those conditions. So Ambassador Dyess and
                    I had one long lunch together, with the new DCM, and I just had a short talk
                    with them. We didn't get into details about anything greatly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you came back and what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Well, there were no assignments for officers in my category at that
                    time, so I was given various jobs. One of the interesting ones was to work on
                    Iranian claims, American claims against Iran, which was a project in which we
                    were getting material ready for the International Court in The Hague. And that
                    went on for a few months, and then I was brought into another program, a program
                    in the management structure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were doing various jobs and then you were
                        brought back to be the DCM in the OAS.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: U.S. Mission to the Organization of American States, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That sounds sort of odd, to be deputy chief of mission to
                        something sitting right in Washington, actually.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: It is, it's unique. There is no other position like it. The ambassador
                    was Ambassador Middendorf, who had been my chief of mission on my first tour in
                    the Netherlands, '69 to '72. I'd found working with him always interesting, and
                    so when he asked me to come with him, I did.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>It was an interesting period there, less than two years, but it was the time when
                    we were deeply, and getting more deeply, involved in El Salvador. Our relations
                    with Nicaragua had soured, and this was reflected in the weekly meetings of the
                    permanent representatives of the OAS, who meet in that beautiful Pan American
                    Building here. We saw the beginning of the process for compromise in El
                    Salvador, which still has not come to fruition, in which the presidents of the
                    Central American countries meet together. We also saw the beginning of the
                    Contra movement and other interesting relations. It was also the time of the
                    change of government in Argentina, which was very important, when the Alphonsine
                    government took over and introduced democracy again in that country. But there
                    were still dictatorships in, and they were also represented—Chile and Paraguay
                    preeminent among them. Both of them have changed now, but in those days they had
                    not. So relations were somewhat strained with certain members, but very good
                    with others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I speak as an absolute non-Latin American expert, but I
                        had the feeling that, for some reason, with our Latin American policy under
                        Reagan and all, we got into this thing, particularly in Central America, in
                        a way, way over our heads. We didn't know what we were doing. We felt we
                        could manipulate things there very easily. It seemed to be an inept way of
                        handling it. As a professional Foreign Service officer but also not a Latin
                        American expert, what was your impression of our political masters at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: My impression was almost that that you have, Stu. I felt we went too
                    much for the military effort, in fact.</p>
                <p>It has always been my view that the only peace that is going to last, in, say,
                    the Central American region, is one that's crafted by the countries involved
                    themselves. If they don't build it and if they don't agree on it, it won't last.
                    Yes, you can set up a structure for a few years under a strong man, but, in the
                    final analysis, if he's seen to be supported only by the United States, you're
                    building on sand.</p>
                <p>So I welcomed the efforts of the presidents of the Central American countries to
                    get together, because I think, in the final analysis, that has to be it.</p>
                <p>Now, their problems are different. I'm not sure they're ever going to have
                    Jeffersonian democracies in any of those countries. They'll have their own form
                    of democracy, which may be a little more authoritarian than we are used to or
                    would accept. But they come out of a different culture, a different background,
                    and different traditions. It's not for us, really, to try to force our way of
                    government on them.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Middendorf feel about this? There seem to be some
                        people who came out of what I'd almost call the rabid ranks of the right of
                        the Republican Party into Latin America. But Middendorf comes out of what,
                        you know, was sort of the old Republican international establishment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Well, that is partly true, but he also had strong ties to the
                    Republican right, very close ties with many of them, understood them. But he was
                    also shrewd enough to understand that some of the things they stood for probably
                    couldn't happen, that we would eventually have to compromise. But he stood in
                    very closely with the more conservative members around Mr. Reagan, no question
                    about that. Whereas he and I disagreed on certain points, because I just thought
                    some of the things were going a bit too far for...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, being right in Washington, this being the apple of
                        the eye in our policy, particularly in Central America, of the Republican
                        right, and all the players being right there, did you find an awful lot of
                        sort of meddling by people on what we were doing in the OAS by political
                        players?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Yes, that happened. I'm thinking of cases of congressional staffers who
                    would come and sit in on OAS meetings, and almost, almost try to direct what the
                    US was going to say and do. They didn't always succeed, but they wanted it known
                    that their president, that their senator or congressman was following this very
                    closely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the staffers, with this particular movement within
                        Congress and all, were very important, weren't they? I mean, some of them
                        really at least gave the appearance of being in charge.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: And they had many axes to grind, believe me. And they were not afraid
                    to grind them. At that time, you see, our policy was dominated by the right wing
                    in that regard. The other voices were few and far between.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what did you do there as DCM? I mean, was this one
                        of these cases of smile and watch this go on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: One survived. But we had a good staff there. And, remember, the OAS is
                    involved in many other things such as health and social problems, agricultural
                    problems. A lot of things that are rather like the underlying part of the
                    iceberg that form the great mass, with meetings going on every day on these
                    various subjects, and members of our staff participating, coming back, you know,
                    and discussing it with me, or I would go with them to the meetings, and writing
                    reports, and trying to get policy written.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>You see, we didn't have to send telegrams, in a sense, to get our policy, because
                    we were right there next to ARA where most of the policy was made. Sometimes IO
                    and others, or the E area, economic area, but generally with ARA. So we could
                    get our policy much quicker. In fact, the ambassador and I would attend ARA
                    staff meetings so that we would keep hand-in-glove with them on various things.
                    And this seemed to work pretty well under both Tom Enders and Mr. Motley.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling from ARA towards the OAS and our
                        mission there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: I think, if you want to take the bark off, they would be just as happy
                    if OAS disappeared. But it's there, and it's not really under ARA control, you
                    see. The ambassador can have a direct line to the secretary if needed; one
                    doesn't take that very often. But we want to coordinate policy with them, and,
                    since there are men of goodwill in both organizations, it's generally worked.
                    Occasionally, there have been problems when the ARA people want to go one way
                    and the OAS people have to tell them it just isn't going to wash.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any specific problems that you can think of
                        at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Well, I can't put my finger on a specific problem, but I can say that
                    on some of these Central American issues they would urge us to get the OAS to
                    take a certain stance in support. And we'd say, “We can't do it, the votes are
                    lined up in such a way against us. We can always try, but don't pin your hopes
                    on it, it's not going to work.” Things like that would happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a time when we weren't paying all our dues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: That is true; that started in my time. Congress began to withhold money
                    from international organizations because it didn't like some of the things they
                    were doing. And, in fact, it was withholding it from the OAS because they
                    weren't backing us firmly enough in Central America. Those of us who worked in
                    the field thought this was reprehensible, that it only bred more ill will, it
                    did no good and weakened the organization in the long run, and it looked chintzy
                    from a US point of view. But Congress did, and has only grudgingly now released
                    some of the funds, I understand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There has been very slow response to this.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Yes, well, it forced, of course, a large cutdown in the OAS central
                    staff, not all of which was a bad idea, but it should have been brought about
                    others ways than that. We reaped a lot of ill will by it. You see, up till then,
                    we had been beating on the heads of other countries who hadn't paid their dues.
                    There are always certain Latin countries that have been behind, and we have
                    taken a holier-than-thou attitude. Suddenly, the biggest debtor turns out to be
                    the United States.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DUNNIGAN: Yes, I retired from that, with fond memories of my life in the Foreign
                    Service and the posts I had.</p>
