                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, today is the 9th of January 2009. This is an
                        interview with Joseph G.S-U-L-L-I-V-A-N. What does the G stand for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Gerard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you go by, Joe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Joe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's start. When and where were you born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I was born in Boston, Massachusetts, in August 1944.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's look at the family say on your father's side.
                        Sullivan and Boston one thinks of the Irish.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you know about the Sullivan side of your
                        family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well, not a lot. My father was from the third generation of emigrants
                    but had lost all connection with Ireland certainly. He was one of nine children,
                    brothers and sisters, but didn't have real close family relations outside that
                    immediate group. His mother actually happened to be of Austrian descendency and
                    so it wasn't perhaps the typical Boston-Irish family.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>My mother, on the other hand, was also Irish. Her last name was H-O-A-R and both
                    sides of her family were Irish. My father grew up in South Boston and my mother
                    grew up in Dorchester and Roxbury and they were typical of the depression era.
                    My father's father died when my dad was fifteen. So he had to leave school and
                    support his younger siblings and only was able to go back and get a GED later
                    and study accounting at night in order to work for the city of Boston where he
                    eventually became acting auditor of the city of Boston. He probably had the
                    capability to do much more, had he not had difficult circumstances, but did
                    amazingly well under these circumstances. Nonetheless, he wanted very much for
                    his four children to have the educational opportunities he never had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm still talking to people who represent your generation
                        and my generation, which was the generation before of Foreign Service
                        officers whose parents for the most part didn't graduate from college.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was the times and also the era; they got self-educated
                        and probably did as well as the ones who went through a more formal
                        education, but it's still that era. On your mother's side where did they
                        come from and what do you know about them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well in her case, she was only second generation born in the U.S. so
                    she had slightly more knowledge about her background in Ireland coming from
                    County Mayo and County Galway. So on the one occasion I got to visit Ireland I
                    had no connections to look up. In my father's family, the emigrants who came in
                    potato famine years lost all connection and many of their relatives in Ireland
                    would have died. The further back that emigration occurred, the less likely
                    family ties to Ireland were maintained. My mother's childhood was also
                    complicated as one of seven siblings with very modest income. Her mother died
                    when my mom was in her teens. Nonetheless, my mother was able to complete high
                    school, do some post-secondary clerical studies and work for the State of
                    Massachusetts Health Department.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>My mother and father originally met and wanted to getting married when they were
                    25 but their finances and the depression just didn't permit it. Then began
                    dating again and did get married when they were each 30 in 1937. They lived
                    those times and imparted that experience and values of frugality and desire for
                    education to their four children. I had three sisters and our parents inspired
                    us to secure what they had not been able to have themselves, education first and
                    foremost for its own sake and as the means to a successful life. They sacrificed
                    constantly to provide everything possible for all of us children to achieve the
                    college education they had not been able to afford. So they lived very frugally,
                    both because of their depression background and difficult childhoods but also in
                    order to provide the maximum possible for their four children. I remember that
                    they rented the same rent-controlled two-bedroom apartment for $35. per month
                    until my older sister was 15 and my youngest sister 2 and only then thought they
                    were sufficiently financially secure to buy a single-family home in the same
                    Neponset area of Dorchester, a district of Boston.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At looking at sort of influences in the first place being
                        Irish and from Boston I will ask where did your family fall
                        politically?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: They were like 95 percent of Boston-Irish Democrats, relatively liberal
                    Democrats. My father fell in the in-between war years and already had children
                    by the time of World War II so he did not go into the Armed Services. They were
                    interested in politics but more local and national politics than international
                    and did not have much contact with international issues. I do recall him being
                    appalled at Senator Joe McCarthy's tactics and red-baiting in the early 1950's
                    and my father's strong arguments with his very conservative brother.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about did the Democratic machine Michael J. Curley and
                        all that was that an element in sort of your awareness in things as you grew
                        up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Curley was a few years before me and I don't know how my parents would
                    have regarded him, probably as somewhat of a rogue. But on the other hand a
                    rogue who helped people, sent Christmas packages to poor families, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah, he reflected produced the political bosses of the
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Right and the other element of that in my case not so much associated
                    with Curley but my own collective history on this talking to family members and
                    other people in Boston who knew those old machine politicians was that they
                    provided jobs. Jobs for people, jobs for family members, and the attitude at
                    least among Boston Irish who were probably the principal beneficiaries of this,
                    was that, even if one's own family wasn't benefiting at the moment, they might
                    the next time around. So in many cases, only the most blatant violations of
                    trust, giving phony jobs to people who didn't really work would be considered
                    unacceptable. My dad, working for the City of Boston in the Auditing Department,
                    was aware of some of the shady practices that took place and disliked it
                    greatly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you, as a kid, or your father were they involved in
                        passing out leaflets or elections or anything like that or was there
                        much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: My father was a little bit, and the first political activity that I
                    remember was probably the John F. Kennedy race for Senator in 1952. My mother's
                    father, I believe, had at one stage been a selectman for the city of Boston at a
                    time when those were elected on a very small regional basis. My father had also
                    participated a little bit in politics as a young man, but by the time I was
                    born, their politics for the most part was not active engagement but rather
                    active interest and maintaining themselves involved in that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm going on the assumption that your family was Catholic
                        and how important was the church in your family while growing up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yeah, it was important to certainly both of my parents and was
                    transmitted to the four kids. My father was involved in the St. Vincent De Paul
                    Society, a charitable organization in the local parish church. He was for over
                    twenty years of his active life the president of that association in our St.
                    Ann's parish in Neponset which is the part of Dorchester right close to the
                    Quincy line in the southern part of Boston. My mother as well was active in the
                    women's church organization and all of the children went to the parochial school
                    for at least the first six years and were encouraged to be active as altar boys
                    or choir or something else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about your neighborhood. Did you live more or
                        less in the same neighborhood as a kid?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yeah, I lived until I was ten in a rented two-bedroom apartment in one
                    of Boston's typical three-decker houses in the Neponset area of Dorchester. It
                    was rent controlled so I remember that my parents paid rent of $35 a month from
                    the time they moved in 1937 after their marriage until 1954 when they moved
                    away. They saved and managed to buy a single family house in the same St. Ann's
                    parish a ten minute walk closer to the school and the church. The area we moved
                    to was mostly single family or two-family homes and didn't have the
                    three-deckers which were only a block or two away. So it was for my parents a
                    great achievement to provide more space and better conditions for their
                    family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The three-deckers normally had only three families living
                        in it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well let's talk a little about growing up as a young kid
                        out in the street. What did you do? Before we go to school let's talk about
                        life outside of school.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULIVAN: All right. Well during my first ten years, I lived in a neighborhood in
                    which almost everybody, had three, four, six, eight, ten, twelve children living
                    in one of those three-decker flats. So my memories are of never lacking for kids
                    out on the street. On summer nights you could go out and have forty kids out
                    there playing red rover or whatever games you played out on the street. The ice
                    cream man would come and you got a treat, which might have cost a nickel or so
                    at the time. I had a small play ground within a five minute walk from where I
                    lived those first ten years and by the time I was probably five years old walked
                    down there myself to play baseball and other sports with other kids. There was
                    not a basketball court at first but we would sled in the snow, or ice skate on
                    the fields that were flooded each winter. Most of it was of on your own with
                    much less organized sports for kids than there are today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know I use the term I grew up in the same sort of
                        thing as almost far you know, okay go out and play, and you should be back
                        home by six or something for dinner. Just get out of the house.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yeah, there were no parents organizing activities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it worked.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: It worked fine and I know my sister enjoyed having me as a younger
                    brother because in that neighborhood it was so unusual for her to be an only
                    child. My mother had miscarried between the two of us and that actually by the
                    way is where my middle name comes from. Gerard is the French patron saint of
                    mothers so that's why I have what is rather an unusual name in an Irish Catholic
                    background.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering, it sounds more French doesn't it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yeah, yeah exactly. So in any case when I came along oh my sister was
                    thrilled she actually had a baby brother to push around in the carriage and
                    visit in the neighborhood. She was concerned that while she was at school my
                    mother would actually let me go out of the house alone at probably age two and
                    just walk across the street and play out in the sun on the porch across the
                    street. We children we were never hungry, although we didn't eat well at times.
                    There were times when we had fried bologna for dinner, but we didn't starve; we
                    had enough to eat. We had a good neighborhood background. When we did move when
                    I was ten, I mostly returned to my old neighborhood because that was where my
                    closest friends were. That meant a ten minute walk or shorter bike ride and then
                    I played at the same neighborhood park, which by that time had installed a
                    basketball court. So there was a little more to do even apart from baseball and
                    football.</p>
                <p>I remember in my first ten years, that ten or fifteen minute walk was a
                    relatively long for little kids, fifteen minute walk to school each way and they
                    used to actually break at lunch time and so you would come back and forth four
                    times a day. In the snow and ice if you threw snowballs, that meant your woolen
                    gloves were soaking wet and at least on one occasion I got frostbitten as a
                    result. But overall they are good memories and a normal childhood for that
                    period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Given let's stick to the street life to begin with, was
                        this all Irish? You particularly think of Italians in that area. How did
                        things mix?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Indeed, while the city was broken up into ethnic neighborhoods: South
                    Boston was an overwhelmingly Irish; East Boston and the north end overwhelmingly
                    Italian. Dorchester was probably more mixed and my estimate would be Irish as
                    much as fifty percent, Italians perhaps 30 percent, Polish maybe ten percent and
                    Lithuanian another five percent. I'm just speaking Neponset here, not Dorchester
                    more broadly which had Jewish and other neighborhoods. But Neponset alone had a
                    mixture about as I described and overwhelmingly Catholic and Caucasian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the ethnic groups; you said you went to St.
                        Ann's?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there Irish churches, Irish parishes, Italian
                        parishes and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Not there. I know that even in South Boston there was some of that. In
                    the north end, there were Italian parishes. But perhaps as a result of the fact
                    that Neponset and much of Dorchester were more mixed and often the second point
                    of resettlement for families originally from somewhere else like South Boston,
                    as was the case with my father. As families began to do a little bit better,
                    they could manage to move out of South Boston and move to Neponset, even if they
                    were living in a three family house. So the neighborhood being more mixed,
                    people went to the nearest church overwhelmingly rather than an ethnic
                    church.</p>
                <p>I think there were some families of Polish origin who continued to go to a Polish
                    Church and Polish clubs in other areas of the city, but the majority went to the
                    local parish church. And while a small percentage went to the public schools,
                    the large majority of kids of all ethnic groups went to the local parochial
                    school and were members of St. Ann's parish.</p>

                <p>SULLIVAN: Yeah.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A Catholic school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: A Catholic school and I went to one year to kindergarten which was a
                    public school very close to where I lived at the time, Hemingway School, and
                    then went six years to the Catholic Parochial school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who ran the Catholic parochial school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: An order of nuns called St. Joseph's in the traditional old habits. As
                    I learned later from my sisters, some of those nuns were as young as 19 years
                    old and thrown into a first grade classroom of 48 children and told to manage
                    this. My years and certainly my younger sisters' years in elementary school
                    would have been the early years of the baby boom so that the numbers of children
                    were enormous. And this parochial school education cost each child a grand total
                    of ten cents per week in stationery fees.</p>

                        were born in '44 you were a part of the beginning of the cusp of all
                        this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yes, I think that somehow '44 counts as the first year in the baby
                    boom. So the numbers were huge, no matter how competent the teacher might have
                    been, managing and teaching 48 kids in a class was a huge challenge. My sisters
                    and I were happy to be right up near the top of those classes so for us it was
                    relatively easy and good. We could get the benefit of it, I know that a lot of
                    kids in the lower part of that class were lost, there was just no way that the
                    nuns could manage to teach everyone well in such large classes..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know the stories of nuns being very tough. How did you
                        find the nuns, this was in elementary school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Right, they were tough. I don't remember any times of physical
                    discipline but certainly in terms of being extremely tough, extremely stern and
                    administering collective as well as individual punishments, for instance to
                    write I will not do this again a thousand times or something like that. Family
                    backing for this total: the nuns' writ was absolute.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So I mean if there was a dispute the nuns trumped.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: There were not, as you indicated earlier, helicopter parents in those
                    days. You were on your own, you went to school and you did your own homework and
                    so on. I could look to my parents from time to time on homework, but essentially
                    you were on your own. If you got into any trouble at school it must be your
                    fault and therefore punishment will be doubled at home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you much of a reader?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yes and that was one of the things that both my parents instilled at
                    home. My parents were big readers. They were always reading, they weren't
                    playing with the kids the way parents do today but they were reading at home and
                    talking about what they were reading with each other, but also with us as we
                    grew up and encouraging us to read as well. There was even some degree of
                    competition among the kids. I remember one time my younger sister who was three
                    years younger than me and very bright was intent on matching me book for book
                    through the summer, which sometimes amounted to five books a week or something.
                    Most of that was from the library, of course. We had a public library, which was
                    maybe a five, or ten-minute walk from the house. We would go there and take out
                    maybe the maximum number of books allowed, perhaps seven a week and read all of
                    those.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know the library system in the United States
                        particularly in the city is magnificent. This is mostly a legacy of Andrew
                        Carnegie.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yes, and the Boston public library system was quite good and these
                    branches were well dispersed through the city.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the librarians helpful?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I don't have great memories of the librarian per se. Just of what we
                    were interested in reading. I remember the Landmark series of books, biographies
                    mostly. I think historical figures that would have been something that I would
                    have been reading probably in second, third or fourth grade. A lot of
                    historical, mostly non-fiction probably occasionally fiction, including, as I
                    got older, the classics like Two Years Before the Mast.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any subjects that particularly turned you on or
                        turned you off?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well if we are still in elementary school I guess they were all
                    relatively easy for me and I did well. So it was not a time in which I had a
                    subject that maybe penmanship was my least favorite at that time; one, which you
                    can see, is still a problem today. Maybe art as well. I did less well in the
                    artistic subjects and, when I reflect back, there wasn't much of the extra
                    curricular subjects that there are today; music and so on, that just really
                    wasn't available.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say your parents read as well. Do you recall was the
                        radio or TV or newspapers were your family keeping up with the news and
                        these sorts of subjects that we talk about at home?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yes, they did keep up and I actually think the first television we had
                    was probably when I was about seven. I don't really have memory of the
                    pre-television years other than they listened to radio I know. But on television
                    they did watch the nightly news and did talk about it. I'd say probably more
                    than anything the political aspects were what they focused on. I think I
                    remember actually when McArthur was relieved from command there was a
                    parade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: About '52, I guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yes and we somehow went to that although I don't think they were
                    terrific supporters of McArthur. Indeed, they admired Harry Truman much
                    more.</p>

                        school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: After finishing sixth grade at age 12, there was a Boston Latin School
                    that took people entering either in seventh or ninth grades. I had a friend who
                    was going there who had already had three older siblings, I think, who had gone
                    there as well as his father who had gone to Latin school and then to Harvard and
                    was a high school principal. David was going and I don't know how much I was
                    following his example, how much I thought that this would be a good thing but I
                    decided to do it which was somewhat controversial with my parents because I
                    would be leaving the Catholic school system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Boston Latin School I guess is one of the oldest in
                        the country but it is also highly selective. This is pretty hot stuff.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yeah, I'm sure they were aware of that. My older sister who is five
                    years older than me just told me recently that she had sought to go to the Girls
                    Latin at the time, I guess probably from ninth grade and my parents had
                    essentially prohibited it and had the pastor talk to her. But by the time five
                    years had gone by, my parents had perhaps been softened up and were less
                    absolute. They still talked about it are you really? Why are you? Then the nuns
                    were also upset and I had to deal with that. I think that the alternative vision
                    would have been going to Boston College high school in ninth grade. But I stuck
                    with it and I went and my parents were always very supportive once I make the
                    decision to go; in retrospect it was very good.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: No not really I think my parents would have been positive about that
                    but they never pushed that either on myself or my sisters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then let's talk about Boy's Latin. You were there
                        from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I entered in 1956 when I had just turned, I guess, 12 until 1962 when I
                    graduated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Boy's Latin?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Traditionally, it was large, intended to be intimidating, particularly
                    for a seventh-grader. At the initial assembly they would tell the new students
                    to look to their left, look to your right only one of you are going to make it
                    through here; the other two are going out the door. In fact, the numbers who
                    failed out were even greater than that. I think that of every six that entered,
                    only one actually emerged at the other end.</p>
                <p>Now I managed to get in without taking the examination. At that time they used to
                    allow you in if you had all A's and B's you could skip the entry examination.
                    There were a lot of smart kids there, a lot of very competitive kids, a lot of
                    kids whose family environment was very much push, push, push. It was a fairly
                    intensive academic environment which I gradually got used to and could manage
                    but not without my share of mediocre grades.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a significant Jewish element there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yes there were. In Boston at the time, the Jewish population was
                    perhaps ten percent, mostly in a part of Dorchester called Mattapan and other
                    parts of Dorchester, but at Boston Latin School, Jewish students might have been
                    as much as a third. These kids, because they were city kids as opposed to kids
                    from the suburbs of Newton or Brookline were frequently the first generation in
                    their families with an opportunity to go to college and therefore really
                    carrying their parents' ambitions that they be successful through education.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said maybe one out of six stayed. How was the weeding
                        out process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I forget the specifics of it, but certainly if you had failing grades
                    or a failing average over the course of the eight grading periods, you were
                    expelled. I don't remember the seventh and eighth grade process of where those
                    kids wound up going, but in the ninth grades on the typical place was Boston
                    English which at that time was directly across the street on Avenue Louis
                    Pasteur in the Fenway area of Boston. Hopefully most of them graduated and some
                    of them, including some I knew personally continued on to college, although
                    their chances of getting into the best colleges were less than those from Boston
                    Latin.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well we had of course a pretty rigid program of which you had to take.
                    You had to take essentially six years of Latin and several other languages. Not
                    too many years before me, Greek used to be required, classical Greek. It was not
                    required in my time but other languages were so, I wound up taking two or three
                    years of French, two or three years of German. I enjoyed languages, although not
                    French, because I didn't have very good teachers. Latin I had good teachers, Joe
                    Desmond being one of those teachers, and a good German teachers named Van
                    Steenbergen and Donovan. So I liked languages.</p>
                <p>I liked history I know; there was very little science. In math, I did okay, not
                    great and wound up taking trigonometry as a high school senior. There were very
                    few science courses at Boston Latin. I took physics in my senior year in high
                    school. There were no biology courses at Latin School then and the only other
                    science option would have been a chemistry course. But Latin School had
                    overwhelmingly a pretty narrow classically oriented, liberal arts
                    curriculum.</p>
                <p>Civics was another course that I really liked. I enjoyed the subject matter of
                    all American systems work, the constitution, the electoral process and civic
                    institutions. That course had some impact on me in thinking about where I would
                    like to go to university and what I would like to study there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now did the election of 1960, Kennedy versus Nixon,
                        did that hit you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Sure, both because there was, in fact, a Boston Latin School
                    connection. Kennedy's grandfather, Honey Fitz, had gone to Boston Latin and
                    there were other connections with the family and Boston politics in general. The
                    Boston Latin School band, I remember, was invited to play at the inauguration
                    and so the Kennedy presidency had a big impact at Latin School. There was also
                    the Boston connection of the Kennedy's that made his presidency a point of
                    pride. At the time of the inaugural address, I would have been sixteen and
                    therefore the appeal of “Ask not what your country can do for you but what you
                    can do for your country” was something that made an impact and certainly was
                    something that fit into my parents' own values. Since my father didn't have a
                    military background, my parents' interpretation of this was not that the
                    children should think of a military career, but rather think of the other ways
                    you can go into government and be helpful to others. There probably was another
                    element in their mind, which was that government jobs are good secure jobs,
                    which in times of depression don't lay off people the way the private sector
                    does.</p>

                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I can remember vaguely the McCarthy hearings, which were relatively
                    soon after we got a television. Watching those in the afternoon, my mother
                    watching those. My mother had strong, anti-communist attitudes and had, at an
                    earlier stage been attracted to Father Feeney's radio addresses, as were many
                    Catholics at the time..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: In the pre-World War II period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I saw him a couple times and he used to preach in The
                        Commons.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yeah, that's right who was almost...yeah but Feeney was sort of
                    similar.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very anti-Semitic.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yes. She was, I don't think anti-Semitic per se. She had Jewish friends
                    and colleagues from when she had been working that she stayed in touch with. But
                    she had some emotional pacifism, a feeling that we should stay out of war at all
                    costs and that if we are being drawn into war, it was at others' behest,
                    particularly the Soviets', and therefore not a good thing for us. I don't think
                    my father was with her on all that stuff.</p>
                <p>In any case, when the McCarthy hearings began, as I recall, my father's
                    disposition on that was that McCarthy had gone overboard and that this was a
                    craziness that he was advocating and they were not supportive of that. I think
                    again there was probably some elements of resistance to strong military action
                    that was somewhere in this. So their attitude towards the Cold War was not as
                    black and white as would have been the case in many other people that they knew
                    and certainly people that I encountered, their friends and family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At this time you were in Boston Latin? Did you feel any of
                        the class warfare the Boston Irish versus the Yankees?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Sure that was all part of growing up you know and I can't say that I
                    experienced any of it myself. I think my parents felt that they had and my
                    mother certainly recounted the stories of signs stating that Boston Irish need
                    not apply for jobs. I don't know whether it is true or fiction, but they
                    recounted the stories that Irish were made to work Sundays so that they couldn't
                    go to church and things like this. So, yes, there was very much a feeling of us
                    versus them.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah. What about social life there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yeah, well it was pretty structured and rather limited. I guess I
                    should say from the time I was fourteen I began to work summers in any case. I
                    was fortunate my father actually managed to find a way to have me interviewed
                    and hired at Fenway Park, working during the Red Sox games selling ice cream and
                    programs and so on. I did that for seven years even though about three years
                    into it I began to work other summer jobs as well.</p>
                <p>But the social life was school dances or something. There used to be a weekly
                    dance at Boston College High School, a Friday night dance that I went to
                    throughout high school with friends. Most of my close friends were probably
                    either people from the neighborhood; there were about five or six of us from the
                    neighborhood who played CYO baseball together and went to Boston Latin School
                    together. So we commuted together, which required three separate transports to
                    get there each day. That was a bonding experience there in the subways an hour
                    each way each day. Other social life, not a lot, I didn't have a lot of money so
                    it was an occasional movie or something, certainly not a regular deal. Hanging
                    out in the neighborhood with mostly guys and that was largely it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Boston, of course, every city has its own thing. When I
                        got out of the military in '54 I spent a year at Boston University getting a
                        masters degree and with a name of Kennedy and I'd grown up Episcopalian but
                        I was really A-religious and I could see girls that I would meet sound me
                        out to see if I was Catholic or not Catholic. For them this was important
                        one way or the other. To me this never occurred to me that they would give a
                        damn.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I would say there was probably both some feeling transmitted from my
                    parents that certainly you would want to marry another Catholic and nobody else
                    and probably another Irish because Italians were different. In fact, my parents
                    proved far more open-minded than that in practice with women that I eventually
                    dated or even married. Once I made a decision, they were always supportive. But
                    it was what they had been taught or absorbed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well we've come to 1962 you graduate. Obviously you were
                        pointed toward higher education weren't you? What were you looking at and
                        what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yes, I had done very well in the SAT's and those were years,
                    fortunately for me, when the SAT and Achievement test scores counted more than
                    one's high school grades. So I applied to those schools that I was expected to
                    do. But I wanted to apply to a place where I might get a scholarship. I still
                    had two younger siblings. My oldest sister had actually opted not to go to
                    college and got married soon thereafter, although she later went back. But two
                    younger siblings were still coming up and it would be a good thing if I could
                    get a scholarship. I had been able to earn and put away probably about as much
                    as a thousand dollars per summer which at those days came close to paying some
                    tuitions; helping substantially. So the three schools that I applied to
                    initially were Boston College, Holy Cross and Notre Dame. Ironically, at almost
                    the last minute in some ways, in the month of December of my senior year in high
                    school, a neighborhood friend was working as a license plate runner for an
                    insurance company for the Christmas season. Everybody used to have to change
                    their plates in Massachusetts of all the bad days between December 31 and
                    January 1 so they all needed their new license plates by that date. So the
                    insurance companies wanted people to run between the insurance company and the
                    registry of motor vehicles near North Station in downtown Boston in December. So
                    a friend encouraged me to work with him at the Travelers' Insurance Company,
                    where I met one of the company's very successful insurance agents named John
                    Baronian who was a Tufts University graduate, a good football player at Tufts
                    and a strong alumni member until he passed away within the last year. But John
                    encouraged me to apply to Tufts as well and arranged for me to visit and
                    interview at Tufts.</p>
                <p>So I got the university catalogues and one factor of greatest interest to me was
                    Tufts' relative freedom to choose my own program. Certainly Tufts students had
                    much more freedom to choose their courses than any of the other three schools I
                    had applied to. At that point I was drawn to government, political science, and
                    history, and I could do that early on as opposed to going through a fixed
                    curriculum in the first several years. So I applied to Tufts. There, I knew I
                    would definitely need a scholarship because, as I recall, the tuition was an
                    “outrageous” three thousand dollars a year. Well I got into all of them but
                    Notre Dame didn't offer a scholarship; Holy Cross may have offered a partial
                    scholarship and Boston College offered a full tuition scholarship, but with the
                    expectation that I would commute. Tufts offered a scholarship with extra money
                    so that I could live on campus. They weren't going to cover everything but they
                    were going to provide enough so that together with a work scholarship and my own
                    summer earnings I would be able to do it without asking my parents for anything.
                    It was a school with a good reputation and so that is where I opted for.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, you went to Tufts from '62 to what '66?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: '66 right.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Tufts like at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: What was Tufts like? Well relatively small I guess it was about 3,000
                    students. There was a girl's part of that, Jackson. There were a number of
                    students, I don't know what percentage, at least ten or fifteen percent probably
                    who were pre-med, pre-dent students and they were pointed in a specific
                    direction and knew they had to be super grades or else they had no chance of
                    getting into medical or dental school. There was a significant engineering
                    school that was also a substantial part of the university. But within social
                    sciences there was a good number of students, the English department was very
                    solid and enjoyable. It was a different life, of course, a social life as well.
                    Living on campus it's a different world and a whole new world opens up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did your parent's feel about you had already been to
                        Boston Latin, which had sort of severed the church education ties you might
                        say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Correct, I think they didn't know Tufts particularly other than it was
                    a pretty good school, but they didn't know very much about it. They knew much
                    more about Boston College. They might have leaned in the direction of Boston
                    College but when I made up my mind they were fine and supportive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said you had sort of a work/study arrangement. What
                        were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: For the first couple of years working on the switchboard serving
                    several of the dormitories and then my last two years being a “manager” of that
                    operation. So that was the official work/study component of the scholarship and
                    then I also wound up actually joining a fraternity. By the time I became a
                    junior I was assistant steward and then later steward of the fraternity,
                    responsible for food orders and service, which gave me free board.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which fraternity was this?</hi>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the student body like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Let's see what was the student body like? I think they were pretty
                    serious in that it was academically pre-med, engineering, and fairly
                    rigorous.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That sets the real tone.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yes and while I think probably at least a quarter of the engineering
                    and pre-med students eventually would wind up dropping back and being economics
                    majors or something else because they couldn't handle the demands. But all the
                    students were pretty well integrated, in part because from the time I joined the
                    fraternity and particularly from sophomore and junior years on, my closest
                    friends were fraternity members and a number of them were engineers. They worked
                    hard; they had to work hard to make it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn't coed at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well the Jackson College was virtually identical to Tufts; they had a
                    separate administration but we all took classes together. There were also at
                    that time other schools which were part of Tufts, including the Boston School of
                    Occupational Therapy as well as physical therapy school,</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever run across Fletcher or was that there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Oh yes, Fletcher was a graduate school of law and diplomacy under both
                    Tufts and Harvard, but on the Tufts campus. And from freshman year, the first
                    time I ever even had any acquaintance with Foreign Service as a potential career
                    was because Fletcher students were our graduate assistants in the government and
                    history courses. So here were folks, some American and some non-American
                    graduate students, sometimes being sent there by their own governments to
                    eventually become diplomats or in the midst of their diplomatic career. So those
                    were our graduate assistants and I learned a lot from them and about career
                    options.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved with foreign affairs? What was
                        happening beyond Boston?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yeah, probably only a little bit. Tufts had a few demonstrations in my
                    time. I think Hubert Humphrey spoke there and had some anti-Vietnam
                    demonstrations but for the most part no; I was aware of them, I followed. I
                    remember a paper I wrote in freshman or sophomore year in which the subject was
                    what to do in Vietnam. The professor's bias was, in fact, that we should send in
                    far more troops and deal with the situation, but you could write whatever you
                    wanted defending your view. So those things were very much subjects of both
                    course work and things people would talk about. But I think the degree of
                    activism through 1966 was a lot less than it became several years
                    thereafter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really the next couple years really were when the things
                        really got going. What was your major?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Government, political science.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you looking at government at the sort of how the
                        United States worked or was it a broader sweep?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: It was both the United States portion and also international aspects
                    and certainly I took a fair amount of course work on Latin America, in
                    particular, and the usual European history and political systems. So yeah by
                    that point I had an increasing interest in international affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you moved up and you were getting near graduation in
                        '66 how did you stand military wise and just in career wise?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I had actually been in Air Force ROTC my freshman year, but dropped out
                    after that year because I did not find it very interesting. As I approached
                    graduation, the military draft was a factor, but there was deferral if you went
                    to graduate school and I was interested in graduate school. I took the Foreign
                    Service exam while I was a senior in college and the oral examination thereafter
                    and passed. But, I think, at that time I just decided that it would be better to
                    get some graduate studies first, almost a wrong call, but I did that. Then I got
                    into Georgetown and went to Georgetown Graduate School. I also had the feeling
                    that living in Washington and being closer to government and in a less
                    provincial setting — yes, Boston is provincial for Bostonians — would be good so
                    I went there and the deferment was automatic for those going to graduate
                    school.</p>
                <p>By the spring of my first year of graduate school, I also began to work part-time
                    in the academic year and then full time in the summers for the public health
                    service in NIH (National Institutes of Health). It was interesting and I was
                    actually considering a public health service career, because they had something
                    called the Public Health Service Commission Corps. So I finished the two-years
                    of graduate school at Georgetown with a heavy focus on comparative politics and
                    international relations. But as I was finishing up my masters at Georgetown, the
                    time of eligibility for me to enter the Foreign Service based on my earlier exam
                    results was winding down and the Foreign Service was not taking new entrants at
                    that time. I was told that yes, you are on the list but we are not going to be
                    taking people at this time. So I had to make a decision what to do and I was
                    offered the opportunity to join the Public Health Service Commission Corps and
                    did that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well let's talk about Georgetown.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there for two years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Georgetown as compared to other schools
                        you had been to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well it was a lot less good than it is now or than it was in 1992 when
                    I did a diplomat-in-residence semester there. I found the courses were
                    overwhelmingly in the evening, the professors often had another job or were
                    doing other things and so it was often a part-time experience for them. I was
                    not in the masters in Foreign Service program, but rather in the government
                    program and I would say it was mediocre. There were some good professors and
                    some not very good. It was good for me because I needed both the additional
                    course work and the experience of living in Washington, which gave me a much
                    better feel for foreign policy that I would not have had otherwise, but
                    Georgetown was not a terrific school in those years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the first place while you were at Tufts what had
                        attracted you towards the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I think in part that there were Fletcher School people who had either
                    that career ambition or at least were well aware of it and talked about it. It
                    was something where this was interesting, these are the things that really
                    interest me and these are jobs which I could do that would also be very
                    interesting for me for a full career. So there it is and that is what attracted
                    me from undergraduate on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall any of the questions asked you on the oral
                        this first time around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Whether they offered a cigarette and no ashtray and so on? No I really
                    don't and, in fact, I would up taking the oral twice, once in my undergraduate
                    senior year and then again when I had to retake it about three years later. I
                    actually did less well on the written exam the second time so I barely qualified
                    to make it into the oral, but then made it through that the second time as
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were with the Public Health service what were
                        you doing and how did that impress you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I was what was called a health service officer which is a generalist,
                    but was working in a health manpower statistics office. In effect, I was doing
                    statistics with health numbers. I'm not a statistician, but the office director
                    and other people in the office were statisticians and others focused on
                    administering programs to promote education in allied health professions. The
                    majority of our work was projecting numbers of people, projections, rather than
                    sophisticated statistical formulas. It was something I could do also and I had
                    common sense and I could function in an office environment and deal with people.
                    So projecting needs for health professionals and educational production of
                    needed health workers. My office focused on allied health, meaning health
                    professionals other than doctors, dentists and nurses and projected needs and
                    promoted higher numbers for education in these areas. We had a number of grants
                    with the state of Washington health department, the Oregon medical association,
                    and the Pennsylvania hospital association so we managed these contracts as well
                    and agreed on scopes of work and measured and talked with them about carrying
                    out their activities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did you do that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well I was doing it already probably about a year as a civil service
                    worker, initially part time, and after a while full time, while going to school
                    part time during my second year of graduate school. So when I switched to the
                    commissioned corps of the Public Health Service in April of 1968 I had already
                    been working in that office for about a year and then did two additional years
                    as commissioned corps. In that period I did take the Foreign Service exam again,
                    but at the same time was considering a career in health and staying in the
                    commissioned corps. If I had done that, I would have needed to go back and get a
                    masters degree in public health. Certainly my own office would have supported
                    that and encouraged it. They would have wanted me probably to do it in health
                    statistics, but I might have been interested in doing something less statistical
                    and broader. In any case, I seriously considered it but then the Foreign Service
                    opportunity was there again and they did indeed have a place for me in an
                    upcoming class in June of 1970 so I left the public health service in April of
                    1970.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you came into the Foreign Service in 1970. What was
                        your training group, your A100, like?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Forty-two members, three women, about fourteen as I recall USIA. As I
                    recall two or three Black officers, two or three Hispanic officers, I know these
                    numbers more or less because doing recruiting as a diplomat-in-residence, I
                    would sometimes compare the numbers from my entry class to more recent incoming
                    classes. So the entry classes at that time were not very ethnically or gender
                    diverse. They were from various places around the country certainly, but were
                    less geographically diverse than today's FSO's as well. Ron Neumann was the son
                    of an academic and Ambassador; others also had a foreign service background,
                    like Rusty Hughes whose father had been a consul. So there were several who were
                    second generation Foreign Service but I would say that the class was not
                    predominately what people used to regard as the old Foreign Service from Ivy
                    colleges and perhaps Berkeley or Stanford. They were more diverse than that but
                    were mostly about my age, 25 or 26, some a little bit older, average maybe
                    twenty-eight or so as a median. Now new classes are coming in with the median
                    age of about thirty or thirty-two so it's a little bit older these days. From my
                    class of 42 officers, about six became Ambassadors, including two
                    African-Americans. Most striking, of course, is that there were only three women
                    among 42 entrants.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were your class and you...how was Vietnam viewed at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I had a close friend who had come into the Foreign Service, who entered
                    in one of the immediately previous classes whose class had gotten involved in a
                    major confrontation over what, I think, had been the intention to send that
                    entire class to CORDS program. They wrote a letter of protest to the secretary
                    of State or the Director General, as I recall. Henry Kissinger, then at the NSC,
                    reportedly preferred to fire them all, but Secretary of State Rogers disagreed
                    and most of the class didn't go to CORDS. But it was a protest, I think,
                    specifically over the Cambodia incursion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was in the ...spring of '70.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: '70 yes so just before I came in. So we were not presented with Vietnam
                    as a first posting but there were several people assigned to Laos. But the
                    Vietnam war was a point of controversy?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well how did you feel about Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: How did I feel? Well in the years that I had lived in Washington it was
                    indeed a very much more active issue and yes there were a lot of demonstrations.
                    I did participate in some of them; not the loudest of them at the Pentagon; that
                    I avoided deliberately. As time went on, I became increasingly opposed to our
                    engagement in Vietnam.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Training was okay but rather superficial when I look at it in
                    retrospect. When I see how much more rigorous it is today, the entry class in
                    1970 had just six weeks of orientation. I would say probably when I compare
                    myself to my Foreign Service classmates I was probably both less sophisticated
                    with less background than they had in how the world worked and particularly how
                    the U.S. government worked. So at times in that orientation class, I felt like I
                    was playing catch-up. I remember actually accessing my records recently in which
                    one of the class mentors wrote that I might make a good personnel officer in the
                    future, a comment not meant as a complement, I'm sure. Then because I was
                    assigned initially to Vera Cruz, which later became an assignment in Mexico
                    City, I did the consular training which at that time consisted of rote training
                    by non-trainers who came in and read the consular law with respect to visas and
                    passports. But there was no hands-on experience included in the training.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Alice Kerr running the program then or not?</hi>

                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: It was deadly. They gave a little test so you had to memorize the law
                    to be able to pass the test the next day, but other than that it was just a
                    waste.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah, well how come your class was able to avoid
                        CORDS?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I'm not sure, I think they must have decided by that point that either
                    it wasn't worth the hassle or maybe they would do better taking people who were
                    second tour or third tour and sending them rather than first-tour officers.</p>

                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yes. The other thing I remember if you are interested in the training
                    experience. I remember, probably part of the orientation class, getting the old
                    diplomatic security briefing in which indeed we may have been one of the last
                    classes that had the chart put up on the wall of how many homosexuals had been
                    caught in the Foreign Service. It was really just right out of the book from
                    that era.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yeah. Well when I came in in 1955 we were all struck by
                        the fact that we used to go up to the security corridor of the State
                        Department and start giggling because it seemed like everybody's middle
                        initial was X as for Xavier or something. It was extremely Irish there and
                        we were told that these Irish men felt that you were somewhat of a deviant
                        if you were having relations with your wife and kept the light on you know.
                        Well Joe I'm looking at the time and I think this is a good place to
                        stop.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we will pick this up when you are off to where? Mexico
                        City?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yeah, my assignment was but I guess I should add one personal note in
                    there as to sort of close the chapter here. I did get married in December of
                    1970 shortly after joining and very shortly before departing for post in
                    February, 1971. Obviously this was a relationship that I had before entering the
                    foreign service and being assigned overseas helped prompt us to make a decision
                    at that time, so we got married in December, 1970. As they still do today at the
                    end of the A-100 orientation course, I was assigned as Vice Consul in Vera Cruz,
                    Mexico via five months of Spanish language training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the background of your wife?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: She grew up in Atlanta and in D.C. as the daughter of a public health
                    service physician. I guess that is how we met while I was working in public
                    health in NIH. She was working there as well as a management intern a graduate
                    of Wisconsin University.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, well we will pick this up in 19...was it '70
                        or...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: '70 or '71. '70 I did the Spanish training, twenty weeks of Spanish
                    training and then a scheduled February 1971 departure for Vera Cruz. In the
                    course of my Spanish language training, I was in touch with the vice consul in
                    Vera Cruz, who was telling me the good as well as the bad of life and work in
                    Vera Cruz. I was doing the usual stuff such as reading about Vera Cruz and all
                    the history and getting excited about it and packing off all the winter clothes
                    for storage. Then I was told maybe three weeks before departure that, oh, by the
                    way, you are not going to Vera Cruz. They told me that they were going to close
                    Vera Cruz so you are going to Mexico City instead.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Welcome to the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: That's right, that's it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, today is the 6th of April 2009 with Joseph Sullivan.
                        Joe we're what 1970?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: In 1970 I entered the service. In '71 I went overseas for the first
                    time and going off to Mexico City.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '71 and you are off to Mexico City instead of Vera Cruz.
                        Okay, we'll talk about the job in a second but how would you say from your
                        colleagues and all were you given a feel for Mexican-American relations at
                        the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I'd say that I read a good bit on my own and developed a feel over the
                    two years I was there. At that point, there was no country-specific training at
                    FSI, although there may have been two weeks of training on Latin America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, let's talk about that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yeah; and one portion of that was the Tlatelolco massacre had occurred
                    in 1968 in a repression of civic sentiment and we, the United States, were
                    associated directly or indirectly with that in that we had a close relationship
                    with the Government of Mexico and did not question how they dealt with internal
                    dissent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might say what this was.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well it was an uprising for greater citizen rights, a movement of the
                    Left coincident with 1968 uprisings around much of the world. Luis Echeverria
                    was already president of Mexico by the time I arrived in 1971, but he had
                    previously been Minister of the Interior during the time of the Tlatelolco
                    massacre. That Ministry always had close relationships with the United States,
                    and particularly with the CIA, so the U.S. was viewed by the Mexican Left as the
                    enemy. Now ironically even the Mexican establishment such as Echeverria, would
                    have in public been very critical of the United States because that's how
                    Mexican foreign policy balanced very conservative authoritarian internal system
                    of controls with the myth of the Mexican revolution. The revolution and Mexican
                    politicians of the dominant PRI party portrayed theirs as an institutionalized
                    Leftist revolution giving benefits to the people and resisting domination by the
                    United States, which had after all invaded Mexico several times and taken a good
                    deal of Mexican territory.</p>
                <p>So that was in the background. I recall developing friendships with Mexican
                    university students who felt a little bit adventurous that they as university
                    students at UNAM (Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico), the large public
                    university with a great deal of anti-Americanism could be friends with me. One
                    of them invited me to his presentation of his thesis and at that presentation of
                    the thesis, he was criticized by his professor for not having integrated
                    sufficient Marxist dialectic in his analysis in whatever issue he was writing
                    about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well there had been shortly before the Olympics there was
                        basically a massacre of students hadn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yeah that was the '68 uprising, the so-called Tlatelolco massacre for
                    the Mexico City square where students were shot by security forces.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this something that people kept alluding to or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I'd say it was mostly below the surface. You would hear it in dealing
                    with university students, but for average Mexicans probably not. It was an
                    uprising of a minority led by university students and intellectuals, not a
                    generalized uprising, but it was handled very repressively and with a lot of
                    deaths. So certainly among that group of people it left deep scars.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got to Mexico, who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: The ambassador was Robert McBride. I recently inspected The Congo,
                    Kinshasa, and it reminded me that he had been ambassador to Congo Kinshasa back
                    prior to that, probably in the late '60s.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for him or were you so far down the
                        food chain that you didn't really?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I didn't have very much direct interaction, although I was invited to
                    the large receptions. He was always pleasant, a little bit distant. I recall his
                    wife being I guess I don't know the right word...sorrowful perhaps. In the
                    course of the two years that we spent there, the rules changed and she no longer
                    had junior wives like mine, in effect, reporting to her; they had been
                    emancipated. So the system in which Mrs. McBride and the other senior spouses
                    had paid their dues was ending.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, where did you work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I worked six months in the non-immigrant visa section pushing out as
                    many as 200 visa interviews a day; It was basically a machine process. People
                    were pleasant. That was an observation point for me though because I had a few
                    colleagues, like Mike Hancock, who came in as consular officers committed to
                    consular work. The contrast between him and some of those people who had been
                    “Wristonized”, the Foreign Service staff officers who spent their whole careers
                    issuing non-immigrant visas with minimal chance of promotion, was dramatic. Many
                    of the staff officers developed negative attitudes toward their work and the
                    visa applicants. I would hear them complain that “these people are lying to me
                    or I'm tired of what I am doing.” Many of the new officers who came in with me
                    committed to a career in consular work had a much broader perspective on life
                    and realized that these people coming before them were looking to change their
                    lives for the better, whether they were telling the truth or not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are at this desk or whatever; I guess it was a counter
                        wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Counter yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One, you see 500 Juan's or whomever, how did you make up
                        your mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well doing 200 interviews a day in the six hours you would be at that
                    counter, you really are making up your mind in the first instance based on their
                    appearance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm told some people said they used to look at the
                        hands.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I don't recall looking at the hands but people walking up, you would
                    notice their appearance. You would ask three or four questions and if they met
                    your expectations, then you went ahead either issuing or not issuing. If the
                    answer to my questions didn't meet my expectations then I would continue the
                    interview for perhaps a maximum of three or four minutes more; that's all you
                    could afford and then make a decision and move on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find it hard because most people come up through
                        the academic route really aren't having to make these very important
                        decisions and it's hard to put a new guy or gal into this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Right. I'd say the pressure of rapid-decision making process was
                    difficult. It was not difficult in Mexico compared in other places, like Israel,
                    because most Mexicans accepted the decision whichever way it went. In part that
                    may have been mitigated by the fact that they had another alternative; they
                    could cross the border illegally, if all else failed. But Mexicans didn't
                    resist, they didn't complain, they didn't cry in front of you. They maintained
                    their stoic disposition and said thank you very much and left, but yes you would
                    think about it a little bit as this was something that was affecting their
                    lives, their whole future.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find your supervision?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Almost all of my immediate supervisors had come up through the staff
                    route which was the predominant route for consular officers until the late '60s
                    early '70s. Some of them were good, professional, etc. Some of them had alcohol
                    issues and it may have had something to do with Mexico as well in that people
                    who had problems with alcohol issues were kept close to home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was in personnel at one point and Canada and Mexico had
                        a disproportionate set of people with personnel problems because we didn't
                        want to send them too far. Of course, this created...also London got loaded
                        with.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: The transport costs if they had to come home were relatively less.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then after six months doing non-immigrant visas, what
                        happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Then I worked in the American citizens services section and had a
                    terrific supervisor Lou Goelz, who I think later became at least a consul
                    general.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes, actually Lou replaced me twice once in Seoul and
                        once in Naples.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: He was a delightful fellow, very knowledgeable and he also showed
                    confidence in his people and let them do what they were capable of and
                    encouraged his officers. So I was placed in a position called operations
                    officer, which was anything that didn't fit neatly into a category of a death or
                    arrest or a notarial case for which we had designated officers. So I would
                    receive the people who were lost, the whereabouts cases, the people who were
                    wandering the streets. It was a challenge sometimes. Some of them mentally
                    unbalanced and having two or three of them at times even in my office together
                    and trying to deal with that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The words of wisdom our consuls often have some of the
                        best stories. Do you have any stories from that period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Sure and some of them are not my proudest moments in that you would
                    have a case of a fellow, probably in his 70s, retired, who comes in and says he
                    has no money. The first thing is you don't hand him a bunch of money. You ask
                    for his relative's contacts and you contacted his children. His children
                    apparently have heard this story before and they were not particularly
                    interested in shipping more money to him, I think we eventually squeezed a small
                    amount of money out of them sufficient to get him a bus ticket. We were supposed
                    to do was reach out to what is now HHS so they would receive them at the
                    border.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Health and Human Services.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yeah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it was the public health people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: But the reality was they worked forty hours a week, they weren't
                    interested in doing anything on a weekend and if you had this problem on a
                    Friday you were supposed to baby-sit people who did not want to be baby-sat over
                    the weekend and then send them on up the road. Well I think we wound up
                    babysitting this one fellow over the weekend, but then putting him on a bus on
                    Monday. At that point, he sold his bus ticket, got off the bus, took up drinking
                    and carousing at the next stop with the remainder of his money. So a day later,
                    hopefully in the next consular district, he was discovered again without money
                    and had to be pushed on up to the border in stages.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself involved in sort of confidence men
                        and that type, people who were sort of milking Americans?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well there were some terrible stories really and the worst circumstance
                    would be if an American got into an automobile accident in Mexico. There was one
                    terrible case in which a fellow was involved in an accident, his wife died and
                    then he was being extorted by everybody in the system down in Vera Cruz state.
                    By his account, somebody else had caused the accident. The person who caused the
                    accident was a local person and therefore that person was exonerated and yet
                    Mexican law required somebody to be held responsible for the death of the
                    American's wife. Well, it was this American widower. We would put him in touch
                    with the local lawyer who basically joined in extorting as much money as they
                    could from him. The fellow spent at least the weekend in jail and eventually
                    paid what was necessary to get out of there, and there was very little that we
                    were able to do to help him in the corrupt system that was Mexico at the
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in prison visits?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I did, not a lot, because we had an arrests officer who mostly did
                    that. But we used to cover Acapulco by periodic visits maybe once a month for a
                    couple of days and there were inevitably some Americans in prison there usually
                    for marijuana possession. The majority of them, I think, were fairly happy in
                    prison because for a small amount of money they could still get that marijuana,
                    they could have conjugal visits from whomever they wanted and spend a month or
                    two there reasonably happily.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've heard people say and I don't know if this is during
                        this period but movie actress Merle Oberon lived in Acapulco and was quite
                        generous with trying to help Americans in trouble. I don't know if you ran
                        across this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I did not, no, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you did this for a time then what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Then I actually was moved, it was a formal rotational assignment and so
                    I rotated out. Let me add one feature on Lou Goelz. Lou Goelz as I remember as
                    terrific as he was and he gave me a good evaluation report, but as my fitness
                    report was coming up he said, “Something I need to comment on is how your wife
                    entertains. So could you invite me over to dinner.” We did and that became part
                    of the fitness report. I think that year was probably the last one in which
                    spouses were rated in the employee's fitness report.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Somebody looking at this up until the very early '70s
                        wives were rated.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: That's right. That fitness report by Lou would have probably been in
                    about January 1972.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Most of the time most of us said the wife is a wonderful
                        support who entertains well even if they were falling down drunk. I mean
                        what the hell are you going to say? Although I have seen at one point when I
                        was in personnel I remember having to show somebody the same thing that she
                        entertained too well, too many other gentlemen and all. Oh God, I had to
                        show this report to the man and I mean this was...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Oh yeah and that used to be a confidential section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I did show that and he was rather stoic about it. I was
                        very unhappy to have to do this. But anyway that was cut out although you
                        might say that the situation didn't change because if the wife didn't help
                        entertain it cut in, I mean they were expected to.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Oh yeah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it continued basically although...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well I don't know, hopefully not. I mean Lou to his credit I think
                    really only did it as his obligation as a rater to have a feel for this and put
                    this in. But in any case I then moved on after about a year in Mexico City into
                    the political section and wound up working for a year in the political section.
                    We had a pretty good group of people: Dave Zweifel, whom I'm in touch with today
                    who was a middle grade officer there. Dick Teare was my immediate supervisor;
                    they both went on to be ambassadors. Free Matthews was the section chief who was
                    good but never quite lived up to his father's...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: His father was Doc Mathews.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: He was H. Freeman Matthews, Jr. so I think his father must have been
                    Freeman Matthews as well and was, I think, undersecretary in the late '40s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I was mostly doing multilateral affairs, which meant going over to the
                    foreign ministry and dealing on issues like China and whether the PRC should
                    acquire a UN seat or whether the previous arrangement should continue.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a battle we fought and fought and fought and
                        lost.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yes, that's right. I learned a lot. The person who I dealt with in the
                    foreign ministry most frequently was the deputy director for international
                    organizations, Sergio Gonzalez Galvez, who later went on to the most senior
                    career position in the foreign ministry. He told me at one stage as I presented
                    this demarche and pressed for a response, “I've taken note of your position and
                    that's all I'll say at this point.” So I learned the lesson that “take note of
                    your position” means “no way”.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No way, well this is one of the hardest things in a lot of
                        countries people don't say no. But our people come out from Washington and,
                        for example, the Japanese will take this under serious advisement, which is
                        again no way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you find or did you get a feel for it I'm told
                        that in the political complex in Mexican government the ministry of foreign
                        affairs is the place where they put the Leftists, the people coming from the
                        Left their because it didn't make a hell of a lot of difference whereas in
                        matters dealing with law and order and all that the FBI and their people are
                        very close, the CIA and all that. But the ministry has lots of fun with Cuba
                        and all because again it's not of primary importance. Did you get that
                        feeling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: The only thing I would add to that is that it is not just the foreign
                    ministry, but the Mexican Government of the time's attitude toward international
                    relations in general. That was epitomized by the fact that Echeverria had been
                    minister of interior. Internally he was still very repressive, very controlling
                    but on international issues he often took a very Leftist position advocating for
                    a charter of economic rights and duties. His positions oftentimes were
                    anti-American in public as well, but that was in part, due to the contradictions
                    of the Mexican revolution, the revolution that had promised to work for the
                    people. But certainly by the 1970s, he wasn't doing very much for the people and
                    was putting a lot of the benefits in leaders' pockets instead.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah, did this work give you a good feel for political
                        reporting and looking at another government was this giving you this feel
                        for the profession?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Both of those things, in part because I had a good supervisor, Dick
                    Teare, who, when I produced a forty-page airgram on student activity around the
                    country, patiently worked it down to about a dozen manageable pages. So I
                    learned how to edit and how to write better. So certainly that tradecraft and
                    the learning the multilateral issues as well. Certainly on the multilateral
                    issues in a country like Mexico, if there was a major issue to us, it was not me
                    the third secretary going over and presenting the demarche that would have
                    effect, it was the ambassador utilizing at that point the station chief as his
                    contact to see the president personally in a private setting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was very much a creature of that whole FBI, CIA law and
                        order type.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Right, absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the way for somebody doing this I've interviewed Dick
                        Teare so they can go to Dick's...he got involved in Australia and all of
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: He did, he spent, I think, the last ten years of his career in that
                    area in Australia, New Zealand and I forget where he was ambassador but
                    somewhere in the Pacific.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then how did you find social life there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: It was terrific, the Mexicans in general, notwithstanding students'
                    often wearing anti-Americanism as a badge of honor, were friendly and
                    approachable. Generally you could engage them and they are interested in
                    engaging. Also, the diplomatic community was an active one. We developed a very
                    close friendship with the Mexicans who were our landlords; he an architect and
                    she a kindergarten teacher. We used to travel around the country with them and
                    visited thirty of Mexico's thirty-two states. Rafael and Pilar were godparents
                    of our first son, who was born in Mexico. I also met a USIS officer who became a
                    my closest friend until his passing early this century.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think things have changed now because one has to be much
                        more careful because essentially of banditry.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: There were always risks, the sort of risks that I mentioned that the
                    fellow who got in the auto accident. Bad things could happen; if you got in an
                    auto accident you were at the mercy of the local justice system, local
                    corruption, corrupt lawyers and everybody else. But if you are fortunate and
                    careful, Mexico was a great place. You often had, even among Rafael, the fellow
                    who was my landlord and “compadre”, ambivalent attitudes toward the U.S. It was
                    interesting that he had never visited the United States and never did visit. He
                    had been educated in the Sorbonne for his graduate studies, so I think he
                    probably had some anti-Americanism and the only other time I saw him outside of
                    Mexico was while I was later serving in Portugal. He had been in Spain and at
                    our invitation came over to Lisbon for a long weekend.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At this time you were how old now about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Let's see I came in at 26 and was 28 when I finished in Mexico.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel part of the '60s generation and was there in
                        a way sort of a gap between you and the more senior officers because this
                        was sort of a dividing line don't trust anybody over the age of 30 and well
                        this whole 60s thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I had a beard at the time and I guess I would have been considered
                    suspect but you know I wasn't on the radical fringe either. I could always talk
                    with anybody and so while there was probably some distance with my elders, it
                    wasn't a huge distance and it wasn't a sharp divide there. I think we went over
                    in the last discussion one of the classes prior to mine had had the split over
                    Cambodia and many of them wrote a letter and really it was a major divide. I
                    think from that point probably the Department began to deal a little bit more
                    sensitively with younger officers and it wasn't quite as absolute a position as
                    it may have been before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then you left there in what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: '73 February of '73. We had our first child in December of '72 and then
                    left in February of '73. At that point after some correspondence and seeking to
                    go to Africa, I had corresponded with Janet Hall Diggs who was my assignments
                    officer, spouse of Congressman Charley Diggs. She found me a good African
                    assignment in Kampala, Uganda, and I was happy to take it. My wife was a
                    doubtful because Idi Amin was President at the time, but we set about ordering
                    our consumables and getting ready to ship out after a short home leave. About
                    half way through the home leave I got a phone call, like my Vera Cruz
                    experience, you know, “you aren't going to Kampala, we can't tell you why but
                    we'll find something else for you”. Then a week or ten days later another call
                    saying come on down to Washington and you'll work there as Costa Rica desk
                    officer.</p>

                <p>SULLIVAN: Yeah, that's right. Bob Keeley actually wrote a chapter on that
                    experience in a book I would put together in the 1990's called “Embassies Under
                    Siege.” Bob Keeley as Charge d'affaires and the Department were indeed planning
                    to close the embassy in Kampala and were being very discreet in leaving
                    quietly.</p>

                <p>SULLIVAN: And capable of doing anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah and so we just sort of backed out very quietly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: So I didn't go to Kampala and, as I learned later as well, the reason I
                    became Costa Rica desk officer was after the Nicaraguan earthquake in December
                    of 1972, our consul there who came under a lot of pressure, committed suicide
                    and they wound up pulling the Costa Rican desk officer Dick Milton out to be
                    consul in Managua and therefore looking for a replacement. So lo and behold, a
                    new position was available for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you had...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: The Costa Rica desk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Costa Rica desk. How long were you on the Costa Rica
                        desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was from '70...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: That was about from March of '73 through about April of '75.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now I've interviewed I think it was Curtin Windsor...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Windsor was not there in my time; in my time the ambassadors were Viron
                    Pete Vaky and later Terry Todman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well these are, of course, two...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Two super stars.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...super stars and not just in the Latin American circuit
                        but in the Foreign Service. But Costa Rica from what I gather is one place
                        that not a hell of a lot was happens.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: That's right. In those years there was something of greater interest to
                    us. As always one of the interesting things about being a desk officer is there
                    is always an issue and you wind up learning more about that particular issue
                    than you ever thought you would in the world and in that case it was Vesco,
                    Robert Vesco, and his swindling of Americans; I guess a predecessor of
                    Madoff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a ponzi scheme and Vesco was very much in the
                        headlines, he kept hopping around. He finally died a few years ago in
                        Cuba.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Just a few years ago in Cuba. So later I didn't quite run into him
                    while I was in Cuba in the 1990's, but I could have if I wanted to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well could you talk a bit about Vesco and what was going
                        on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well he had both perpetrated this scheme that was being investigated
                    and for which he was charged and then he fled the United States. I don't recall
                    whether he went immediately to Costa Rica but he certainly was in Costa Rica by
                    the time I inherited the job and he used that presence to shelter himself from
                    persecution. He contributed to the political figures there at the time,
                    President Pepe Figueres, who had been a long time friend of the United States
                    but was not above being seduced by money. Vesco invested together with Figueres
                    in a lumber business. I don't whether in Pepe Figueres' mind, he might have
                    convinced himself that he was not taking the money for himself, but investing in
                    business that would be good for Costa Rica. So Figueres had a big lumber
                    operation that Vesco's money was deeply involved in.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>Then Daniel Oduber succeeded Figueres in '74 and he also was, I think, became
                    beholden to Vesco and Vesco eventually beat the extradition case that the U.S.
                    pursued in Costa Rica, I think it was an interesting precedent. On the one hand,
                    the Security and Exchange Commission was totally focused on this extradition
                    issue and pressing hard for Vesco's return. The State Department was working
                    with them to try and resolve it through extradition. I think at that time
                    probably we didn't do complicated extraditions very well, we expected people to
                    hand people over based on “probable cause”, once we had issued an indictment,
                    without necessarily having to prove their guilt. A number of courts,
                    particularly in Latin America, have been and probably, by then, were
                    increasingly becoming reluctant to turn people over based on “probable cause”.
                    Do I think that was the critical reason? No, I think the critical reason was
                    that Vesco managed to get into the Costa Rican system and corrupt the system.
                    But the judicial process in Costa Rica is more independent than most, and had we
                    done a better job of presenting our extradition, I think we would have had a
                    better chance of prevailing; but in the end we did not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anything else going on in Costa Rica? Dissident
                        groups, people up in the mountains, that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: None of that, but Pepe Figueres had a hare-brained scheme to impose a
                    banana tax so that he could match the performance of the OPEC oil cartel to
                    raise the price of bananas internationally. Of course, that was something that
                    was not going to work, but also pitted him directly against the American
                    companies who dominated the banana business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well there had been banana wars with the Europeans too
                        because they had in Somalia the Italians had...I mean bananas are not a
                        benign fruit.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yeah. Well that is sort of the left over of the colonial protections
                    and advantages that Europeans traditionally gave their former colonies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were sort of part of the Central American group. Were
                        we concerned with various rebel forces around in the area?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Nicaragua at the time was beginning to be problematic and I was the
                    backup Nicaragua desk officer while the Nicaragua desk officer was away. So
                    there were several instances where that erupted. In one case, there had been a
                    kidnapping of a group at a reception in Nicaragua; I don't think there were any
                    Americans involved, but the American Ambassador had been there earlier that
                    evening and Sevilla Sacasa, the long term Nicaraguan ambassador to the United
                    States and relative of Nicaraguan President Somoza was there. The Nicaraguan
                    government decided to pay a ransom and they wanted it in cash. They asked us to
                    help them get it from their account in New York through the Federal Reserve Bank
                    in New York. So on a late Saturday night early Sunday morning, I flew up to New
                    York with the Nicaraguan charge d'affaires during the Christmas season, as I
                    recall, and testified that he was a Nicaraguan diplomatic official. He was given
                    a satchel of millions of dollars and flew to Nicaragua to deliver the ransom.
                    The kidnapers, of course, were a variation of the Sandinistas who carried out
                    that raid. There was a later raid that was even more spectacular, but the
                    December, 1974 raid was one of the first.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well I'm surprised that you were allowed to do that
                        because this is during the Nixon administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And we were taking a very hard line on pay offs if our
                        people were kidnapped so the idea that we were helping somebody else sounds
                        like it almost happened underneath the radar...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yes, I agree with you and I don't recall the specifics but certainly
                    one could have made an argument that we will not facilitate it, but nobody made
                    that argument and the Nicaraguan President Somoza had authorized the payment to
                    secure the release of Nicaraguan citizens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you pick up any reflections of the earthquake in
                        Nicaragua where the ambassador, I think it was Shelton Vance, was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: The ambassador was a political appointee, Turner B. Shelton.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Turner B. Shelton, yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: There was a controversy and you undoubtedly interviewed Jim Cheek.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Uh huh.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I'll provide a little bit of that but most of that is secondhand
                    although I came to know Jim very well visiting him in my capacity as backup
                    Nicaragua officer but also later on when we were both involved in Latin American
                    affairs in Washington. But Turner B. Shelton was a very unpleasant man who had
                    joined himself at the hip with Somoza. Jim Cheek made a very good argument in a
                    dissent channel cable that we needed to distance ourselves from Somoza and force
                    him to open up more and that we had such leverage that we had the capacity to do
                    that and to avoid future problems. It was a very prescient cable in 1973; five
                    or six years before the Nicaraguan situation really blew up. I followed the
                    course of that cable and it was read, but I think overall the decision back in
                    '74 would have been not to disturb sleeping dogs. Kissinger's attitude was not
                    to look for trouble where trouble had not yet arrived. There were enough other
                    problems in the world, there was a Middle East disengagement negotiation going
                    on, there were all kinds of crazies around the world, we didn't need to go
                    looking for trouble.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I recall when I interviewed Curt Windsor he was saying the
                        highest-ranking American government official to visit there was the
                        lieutenant governor of Mississippi.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: What I do remember being personally involved in the selection of a
                    Congressional delegation to Somoza's 1974 presidential inauguration after an
                    election of marginal quality that he had held. The administration wasn't
                    interested in being represented at a high level. There were very few Congress
                    people who were interested and the Senator who wound up heading the delegation,
                    Curtis of Nebraska, as I recall, or Kansas, was pretty low ranked within the
                    Senate itself. But, of course, once he went he then became a major advocate for
                    Somoza alongside influential Congressman John Murphy of New York who had been a
                    West Point classmate of Somoza.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Our relations with Somoza were terribly personal.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yeah, but not at the highest level, you know really relatively low
                    stuff but it was high enough to...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: High enough because nobody else gave a damn.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If you've got a Congressman who is really
                        interested...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...in something and nobody else really cares it's just
                        ineffective.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Johnny Murphy, as I recall, had one key appropriations committee
                    position, but he wasn't a major hitter and Curtis certainly was anything but;
                    but as things developed they became advocates for close relations with Somoza,
                    and as you say, there wasn't anybody really at high levels at the Department or
                    in the Congress who cared enough or saw it as enough of an imminent danger
                    compared to all the other imminent dangers out there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well looking at this here you are a relatively junior
                        officer in a relatively junior country but you are also getting a look even
                        if it's the country over the border of your area of Washington and political
                        influence and all. This had to give you a fairly good idea of Washington and
                        power didn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yeah and it was interesting. I mean the relationship with the Congress
                    there was a then Senator from Florida, Lawton Chiles, who took an interest in
                    Costa Rica and traveled there and it became a long-standing relationship. The
                    relationship with the Congress was also a vantage point on that relationship and
                    working for the first time on countries with assistance programs like Costa Rica
                    and Nicaragua was instructive. I also could see that US post earthquake relief
                    assistance to Nicaragua from 1973 become in a lot of ways the straw that broke
                    the camels back. Somoza was, I think, mildly repressive before the earthquake
                    but after the earthquake he really came to insist on dominating the cement
                    industry so he could dominate the reconstruction efforts. He became ever more
                    rich and ever more repressive of anybody who opposed. The US had the opportunity
                    to object and we didn't object and we let our assistance go forward even though
                    we knew that he was benefiting mightily from it and was being increasingly
                    repressive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any thought at all given...one of the things
                        about Costa Rica is that it doesn't have an army, it has a police force. Was
                        there any pressure within our own government to say hey these guys ought to
                        have an army, everybody's got an army, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I don't think so, although narcotics was a lesser level of
                    preoccupation then and Costa Rica was not at that point a major transit point.
                    In terms of efficiency of their own institutions, the security sector was
                    terribly inefficient because the Costa Ricans would turn over the entire police
                    leadership with every change of administration. This did, of course, have the
                    benefit of not creating a powerful armed force capable of intervening in
                    politics.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: After two years there actually what I did was I signed up to go to
                    Angola. I went into Portuguese language training to go to Angola, which at that
                    point was only an eight-week conversion course.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well also this was a critical time, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Sure, right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was about '74?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: It would have been by that point '75; I would have finished on the
                    Costa Rica desk in about February or March of '75 and would have gone for eight
                    weeks of training in Portuguese. So it was the critical time in that the
                    Portuguese revolution had happened in April of '74. There was already internal
                    conflict within Angola, a lot of fighting and the turnover to independence set
                    for November 11 of '75. So in the lead up to that, certainly my wife began to
                    have great concerns for our then two children and at that point, as I recall,
                    the Department didn't even have a separate maintenance allowance policy. We had
                    a second young child who had just been born and what was that going to be like
                    going out there with two young children. So at a certain point in that process I
                    expressed concerns and they said it didn't make sense for me to go so that
                    assignment was cancelled and soon thereafter, Luanda was closed. At the same
                    time, Frank Carlucci was staffing up Lisbon and he or somebody on his behalf
                    asked if I would like to go to Lisbon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay so you were in Lisbon from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: From September of 1975 until summer of 1979, four years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was I think one of the most critical times of the
                        Foreign Service. I mean the story of Frank Carlucci...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...in Lisbon. I interviewed Frank and some others but I
                        wonder if you could talk about the situation there when you arrived and sort
                        of what you were prepped for before you went.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Okay and I just read a book actually in Portuguese, Carlucci Versus
                    Kissinger by Bernardino Gomes that relates to that period. So, some part of it I
                    will try to distinguish what I actually knew then from what I recently read. But
                    certainly it had been publicly in the press that Kissinger's theory was that
                    Portugal was lost to the Communists and that therefore Portugal ought to be
                    allowed to be lost, expelled from NATO and serve as the vaccine against
                    Communization of all of Southern Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There is also the time of something, which was called Euro
                        Communism. ...Italy and other ones, it looked like there was going to be a
                        new face of Communism more sort of civilized rather than Russiafied. But it
                        was still extremely dangerous in our point of view.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Although the Portuguese were not part of that Euro-Communism as the
                    Portuguese Communist Party leader Alvaro Cunhal was a Stalinist and not at all a
                    so-called Eurocommunist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was sort of our blessing in a way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: In some ways yeah but Carlucci had been brought in as Ambassador by
                    Kissinger as a tough guy replacing a political appointee who had been out there
                    who had sought to make the argument that all was not lost. Initially, Kissinger
                    was reportedly disappointed in Carlucci, because he came to the conclusion that
                    the situation could be saved and that the U.S. shouldn't give up on it and the
                    U.S. should not push to expel Portugal from NATO because it had Communists
                    within its government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At what stage was this going on when you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: It was the hot summer of 1975 and it was really the critical period
                    right through November 25 of 1975 when there was a Leftist coup attempt that
                    failed and resulted in the consolidation of Democratic forces both within the
                    military as well as in the government with Mario Soares and the Socialist and
                    other democratic parties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I was in the political section and following internal politics.
                    Initially we had one officer Rick Melton whom you may have talked to, who
                    followed the Socialist Party. I followed the other political parties to their
                    right the PPD they called themselves first and later the Social Democratic Party
                    and the CDS, the Center Democratic Party.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Herb Okun was DCM.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel part of it when you arrived? Did you realize
                        you were going to be part of a take over of the new guys who were going to
                        be up against really the secretary of State and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well certainly that had been part of it. I would say it was probably in
                    the period immediately before I arrived that Carlucci came back to Washington
                    and had a set-to — and this is mostly from the book I've just read, at least,
                    the specifics of it — a set-to with Kissinger. But Carlucci, of course, was
                    clever enough never to operate alone and never be dependent and called upon his
                    Princeton roommate Donald Rumsfeld who was White House Chief of Staff both to
                    give him his points of view and to set a separate meeting with President
                    Ford.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Carlucci had been deputy sectary of health and human
                        services?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So he had a certain amount of political clout, which a
                        regular Foreign Service officer wouldn't have had.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: That's right. I wouldn't say by that point he had convinced Kissinger,
                    but at least Kissinger had to respect that this person one, was beginning to
                    show some results. There was some standing up by Democratic forces within the
                    military, there was this ambassador who could access the president directly.
                    Even Mario Soares, whom Kissinger had reportedly called the Portuguese Kerensky,
                    was standing up in public in ways that merited respect. So Kissinger had begun
                    to change his mind, and the Europeans were pushing back a lot.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Socialist side in Europe was a very strong supporter

                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Of Mario Soares and the Socialist Party and the incipient Socialist

                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: So all those things were happening and this was really a critical point
                    as I recall. I arrived in early September and there was still a lot of agitation
                    in the streets, the newspapers were taken over by Communist workers in some
                    cases...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you went out what were you getting from the desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I actually wound up working several months on the desk before going out
                    in the summer and talked just the other day with Bob Barbour who was deputy
                    director of West European affairs which encompassed Iberian affairs. So the
                    Department was, I would say, chasing its tail a little bit. In this book I
                    mentioned, Barbour recounts a November 25, 1975 staff meeting with Kissinger.
                    Kissinger said, “Tell the prime minister this, tell this person that and tell
                    this other person that and do it right away.” Bob Barbour was there taking notes
                    and passed this onto the Embassy. Then a day later, Carlucci wrote back and
                    said, “With all due respect you know, I really didn't call all these people and
                    at this point, they've solved the problem themselves and I don't think it would
                    be productive for us to contact these six people and tell them what to do.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well this is one of the problems when you get a very
                        tricky situation. You can get people back in Washington being tough as hell
                        when sending out instructions, which may be basically counterproductive
                        because it doesn't always work. In this case it probably wouldn't have
                        worked; I mean we were very fortunate to have had Carlucci.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yeah, I think he was very wise in many ways. One, he took a low profile
                    so we did what we did, we did it mostly with a low profile, notwithstanding the
                    fact that he was the object of continual accusations in the Leftist press that
                    he had assassinated Lumumba and he had done whatever and therefore was an evil
                    person and was coming to Portugal to overthrow the revolution. But he was wise,
                    working quietly with Mario Soares, with moderates in the Portuguese military
                    such as Melo Antunes and working closely and cooperatively with the
                    Europeans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go out with the idea that oh boy this is going to
                        be fun, I hate to say it but I mean this is the sort of thing that gets the
                        Foreign Service moving actually?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Sure, I mean I think being in Portugal almost more than any place
                    convinced me that if I had done anything else with my life, this is what I would
                    have been interested in reading about, wishing I had done. I remember covering
                    the November 11, 1975 evening mass demonstration by the Communists and other
                    groups on the Left, celebrating Angola's independence and in effect turnover of
                    Angola to the MPLA which controlled Luanda at the time. There was some risk
                    there, but it was okay and I somehow had some instinct for how to control high
                    risks. I could observe the demonstration without necessarily being conspicuous.
                    One of my predecessors had been goose-stepped to the airport at one stage but I
                    managed to avoid that, but still found it very interesting and exciting to be
                    part of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Portuguese political types that you
                        were dealing with? There must have been a lot of concern because this thing
                        had been instigated by unsophisticated junior officers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And really didn't know what the hell they were doing, I
                        mean they got into it. But then the Stalinist types who had been hanging
                        around and they really were Stalinists, came out of the woodwork didn't
                        they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yes, there were some military who were influenced by Communists and
                    communists had major influence in several provisional governments over a period
                    of probably about eight months in 1975 before that began to be rolled back.
                    Political types were by the time I got there somewhat more positive. There had
                    already been constituent assembly elections in April 1975 and democratic parties
                    had won about 75 percent in that election. We were fairly confident that the
                    next round of elections for the legislative assembly would be held in April of
                    1976 and that democratic parties would do well again. So the thinking was that
                    things were headed in the right direction, if they could maintain the track of
                    elections determining the outcome rather than the rule of the street or the
                    barrel of a gun. The Portuguese looked to us, the United States, as a means of
                    support, moral as well as economic and political. They didn't hesitate to ask
                    for other support but for the most part were interested in moral and political
                    support.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find at your level reaching out particularly to
                        the Germans and maybe the Scandinavians and maybe the French, the
                        Socialists, because everybody was involved in this thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Personally I recall that I was in touch with the Spanish who were
                    involved particularly in the second phase of the Portuguese transition because
                    their transition process was happening simultaneously. Within weeks of when I
                    got there, the Spanish embassy was burned down by leftist demonstrators in
                    Lisbon. But the Spanish had a lot of concerns and the Spanish Socialists were
                    active within their diplomatic corps. A fellow whom I later worked with in Cuba
                    was one of those diplomats who was hoping for a moderate outcome that could then
                    serve as the example for Spain. I didn't work directly with the other Europeans,
                    as I recall, but certainly Carlucci did and other people in our embassy did.
                    Charlie Thomas was the political section chief at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Portuguese you were dealing with, the
                        political types? I would think particularly since they were somewhat on the
                        Right that they would be worried that this thing could turn into a really
                        nasty Leftist government.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: The party of the center-left, the Social Democratic Party(PSD,
                    previously PPD) were by that time beginning to be slightly more assertive.
                    Soares had shown more courage earlier, but the PSD was somewhat more assertive
                    by the fall of '75 and the Spring of '76. The Center Democrats, the CDS, on the
                    other hand only gradually moved from the shadows out into public light and did a
                    little bit better in the elections of the spring of '76. So, yeah, those factors
                    of a right and center intimidated by an aggressive left identifying everyone to
                    their right as fascists, their term for longtime dictator Salazar, were present
                    and they only began to dissipate over time. Socialists, on the other hand, had
                    the strongest anti-dictatorship credentials and by far the strongest links with
                    the rest of Europe. Many of the Socialists with whom I had dealt had been in
                    exile in Europe, as had Mario Soares, and so knew a lot of Europeans and were
                    part of the Socialist International. They used that to their advantage and were
                    able to block the PPD, later called the PSD, the Social Democratic Party, from
                    having any access to the Socialist International. So the PSD found themselves in
                    somewhat of a dilemma, they weren't quite certain who their international
                    counterparts were.</p>

                    engagement, as has been documented in a book by John Stockwell. It mostly took
                    place out of Kinshasa but there was some observation and activity out of Lisbon
                    as well. We in the political section followed Portuguese decolonization,
                    reported on it, talked to people who worked on Africa but I think probably the
                    principal focus on Angola and Africa was from the station. In early 1976, a
                    congressional amendment prevented any further U.S. assistance in Angola, so at
                    that point the U.S. direct role in Angola ended for about ten years and we in
                    the embassy became distant observers to a civil war in Angola which would last
                    another 26 years of which I would witness the last several years in person. The
                    Portuguese were so consumed with their own internal process that when the
                    Angolan decolonization proved very messy with three separate groups vying for
                    power, each of which had their own international sponsors, arms suppliers and
                    financiers. the Portuguese backed away, let it happen and turned over the key on
                    November 11 and sailed out of town.</p>
                <p>So our involvement in Lisbon at that point became very much working with the
                    Portuguese to help them absorb the returnees from Africa. We provided scores of
                    millions of dollars for that effort. And it was pretty successful absorption of
                    about a million people, a tenth of a small nation in about a year with minimal
                    disruption..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A small country yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Right. So that was one of our first substantial assistance activities.
                    We had talked assistance but for the most part we hadn't provided it until what
                    we called the Sixth Provisional government took office with Pinheiro de Azevedo
                    replacing Vasco Gonzalez as Prime Minister in late September, 1975. That
                    promised a more moderate approach, a more sincere commitment to democracy and so
                    at that point we began to actually provide more assistance and sent out teams
                    from USAID, providing housing investment guarantees and small grant programs for
                    returnees and things like this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the British at all a player? I mean they had this
                        alliance going back to the 14th century.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: They were although I was not particularly aware of it at the time. This
                    book I just read indicates how involved Callahan, the British prime minister at
                    the time, was including through some military guarantees that were useful. Yeah,
                    you're right. I think it was George Kennan's memoirs in which he talks about
                    invoking an 800 year old alliance for use of the Azores in World War II. But the
                    British did provide some assistance and then supported Mario Soares through the
                    Socialist International as well.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think that dealing with this revolutionary thing
                        while we were trying to do what we could we still had to keep an eye on our
                        interests which were the Azores?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yes, although that is a very controversial point and it's interesting.
                    The rumor at the time was that Kissinger was strongly tempted to allow the
                    Azores to be carved off so that we would preserve our ability to use the bases
                    there which had proved a critical linkage point in the Arab-Israeli war in
                    '73.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '73, yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: In fact, this book in Portuguese by Bernardino Gomes that I mentioned
                    has documented through Freedom of Information Act disclosures that the decision
                    reached within the U.S. government was not to pursue that course. So, Jesse
                    Helms was pushing that course and some other people in our political spectrum
                    were pushing courses like that, and there were Azorean separatists out there who
                    were looking for encouragement and support from the United States. We were
                    maintaining contacts with everyone in the Azores and taking a very discreet
                    position vis-�-vis separatism. Mark Paris, another fellow you've probably talked
                    to at some stage, was a first tour vice consul, but brilliant. And with a
                    consul, who was uncomfortable with political issues, so Mark, the vice-consul,
                    did the business. But this book in Portuguese is my source for saying that at
                    the end of the day we resisted the temptation to view the Azores as the key to
                    our ballgame.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sort of the nuts and bolts how did you make your contacts
                        with the political elements?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: One at a time. There were probably a few that the embassy had in
                    advance with the political parties and they would have been handed over to me
                    and I would have pursued them, but then I would ask who else I should meet.
                    There was one fellow in particular within the PPD/PSD who was very helpful and
                    he was happy to introduce me to others and I would pursue those people. And
                    sometimes I'd just call blind and just ask to see people within the hierarchy of
                    the party. Later some of these people became Cabinet Ministers, but I could
                    still see them and they were open to being seen. Carlucci generally reserved the
                    party secretary general for himself but virtually everybody else was fair game.
                    One factor in my favor was that most of the new political leaders, including
                    cabinet ministers were young, in their thirties, my contemporaries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you didn't find reluctance on the part of the
                        Portuguese political types to talk to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: No, I think maybe that might have been in part the specific timing
                    arriving in September. At the July 4 reception, just two months earlier, the
                    only prominent Portuguese politician who came to that reception was Mario
                    Soares. I know Carlucci always gave him credit for showing that courage to come
                    while all the rest politely declined the invitation; they were reluctant to be
                    seen with us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But things rapidly changed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Things began to change in that summer and the Socialists played a key
                    role. The military moderates also stood up, the most prominent of whom was Melo
                    Antunes, who became foreign minister and helped organize what they called the
                    Group of the Nine, that took a social democratic position in opposition to any
                    effort to use force or repression and opposition to ongoing efforts by leftist
                    worker unions to take over enterprises, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get around the country much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yes, all over, all over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: It's an interesting country. It is true that beyond the individuals,
                    the politicians, the military moderates, the single strongest reason the country
                    did eventually revert it to a more moderate course is that it was a very
                    conservative population for the most part. Starting about thirty miles north of
                    Lisbon and including the Azores and Madeira, Portugal was a very conservative
                    place and the Catholic Church was very strong. As that conservative population
                    and the Church began to take stronger positions, that helped give others courage
                    that the bulk of the country would not accept a Leftist Communist takeover. As a
                    matter of fact, there was some discussion in that period before 1975, and
                    Callahan, as I recall contributed to those preparations, on what to do if it
                    were necessary to retreat to the North and maintain the government in the North
                    in opposition to that from Lisbon to the south.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As I recall, Ed Rowell was involved...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: He was DCM my last two years there from 1977-79.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the blessings was that the head of the Communist
                        Party was one of the old style, sort of the steel teeth, I mean I don't know
                        if he had steel teeth but of that ilk that really was pretty much out of
                        touch with the changing face of even Communism as I mentioned wearing
                        stylish Italian suits and much more open and all. The Portuguese Communists
                        who came in really had been in Moscow too long.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Sure, he had been in Moscow. I forget where he had spent the years
                    immediately before, a capital in Eastern Europe. He also had spent about
                    25-years in prison, many of those years in a place I just visited called
                    Tarrafal in Cape Verde and then later in Peniche in Portugal, but escaped from
                    prison and then went to East Europe. He was indeed tough, although in this book
                    I just read, interestingly at one stage he had pitched our ambassador, I think
                    Carlucci's predecessor, saying don't worry I accept that NATO is what it is.
                    Communist Party leader Cunhal said the right things in that particular
                    conversation, although he was also using every bit of force and threats possible
                    to achieve his Communist revolution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for the military because they had a
                        real...well I mean the military essentially took over and also being part of
                        NATO was a great advantage to them and to have the threat of NATO expelling
                        them really was hitting them hard. Did you get any feel for that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I wouldn't say that I got a personal feel, I knew what was happening
                    and I knew our attaches and I knew Carlucci and others were engaged in that. I
                    didn't have much personal contact with armed forces officers except for a few
                    who were serving in civilian government positions. I'd say the perception I had
                    was that most of them wanted to maintain their professional links with NATO. At
                    a certain stage Bob Schuler, who was our army attach�, had proposed and secured
                    an invitation for General Ramalho Eanes to visit NATO headquarters, probably in
                    the spring of 1975. Eanes was very impressed and later he was the key leader in
                    beating back the Leftist coup attempt of November 25, 1975.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there in '75? What were you doing and
                        what...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yes, we were talking to a lot of people and writing a lot of reports.
                    As a matter of fact, this recent book talks about maybe 12 or 14 sitreps being
                    sent in during the day of November 25, 1975, including everything from what's
                    going on in the street to what's coming over the radio to what we were hearing
                    from our contacts. I remember our assistant army attach� tried driving into a
                    base that had been supposedly taken over just to see what would happen. He
                    eventually got turned back but you know he could report what he had seen and
                    heard. Every element of the embassy was reporting what was happening and, of
                    course, Washington was reacting to that by to tell all these people what to
                    do.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When this coup attempt who was trying to coup?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well there were particular units within the armed forces that were
                    unhappy with the efforts of more moderate military to marginalize them. General
                    Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho was one of the most known figures and was head of
                    something called COPCON and he was involved and knowledgeable of the coup
                    attempt. He was humiliated and marginalized by being implicated in that coup
                    attempt. The degree to which the Communist Party was involved is still disputed
                    today. I think they certainly had a deep involvement in creating all the
                    conditions for a coup, in agitating against any rollback of the “gains of the
                    revolution,” in taking over the media, including the principal radio stations
                    and the Socialist newspaper. The communist party and communist unions also
                    joined with other leftist groups, some of which were clearly front groups, to
                    hold virtually daily demonstrations. Now whether on the day of the coup attempt,
                    the communist party was involved or not is unclear. Certainly by the second day
                    they had pulled back and this book that I just read gives Costa Gomes who was
                    the president at the time credit for having called the Communists and urged them
                    to disassociate themselves. There is also the theory that the Soviets themselves
                    were somewhat of a moderating force in that they didn't really want to see a
                    major conflict with the West as far away as Portugal. We, the United States, as
                    well as the Europeans, had made a major point shortly before in Helsinki
                    meetings with the Soviets of urging them not to mess on our backyard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Soviet embassy I mean were you both covering the
                        same people and did you feel that they were...how did you feel about
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yeah, I think they were on their side of the street, which was the
                    Communist Party, and we were mostly on our side of the street. I think the first
                    contact I recall with the Communist Party was relatively late in my time there
                    maybe late '77 or early '78. Rick Melton, I know, went over and saw one of the
                    middle rank officials in the Communist Party and that had been the first time we
                    had had such a contact. So there really was a sharp break and there was none of
                    the diplomatic communication that came to be later with the Soviets or
                    Russians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, did you have any contact with the church
                        itself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Oh yes, certainly with the Cardinal of Lisbon and other bishops around
                    the country when I traveled around the country on working visits. If I visited
                    almost any town or major city I would visit the local bishop. There were also
                    Jesuits who had a fairly strong presence in Lisbon and I would be in contact
                    with them. Some of it was basically political analysis getting their perspective
                    on developments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure particularly some of the Jesuits must have been
                        revved up too.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: The principal activism probably came...well it came more discretely
                    from the cardinal but most visibly from the bishops in the north because they
                    had the most conservative populations. They actually were encouraged to have
                    street demonstrations that showed it was not just Communists who could organize
                    street demonstrations. In addition to the personal contacts I had, I know that
                    Carlucci was in fairly frequent contact with the cardinal of Lisbon and the
                    Cardinal was, I think, communicating with his people encouraging resistance to
                    communism. At that point it was a very Catholic country and so he and the
                    Bishops had a lot of ability to influence the population through pastoral
                    letters that were read from the pulpit in every church in the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well in Lisbon itself, was there the equivalent that you
                        had in France and some other country particularly France in sort of the
                        intellectuals of the chattering class or somebody. Was this an important
                        element or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I would say less so, less so. There was some of that and they were not
                    as totally on the Left or as predominantly Left as they would have been in
                    France. The most conservative intellectuals had left the country, predominately
                    for Brazil after the revolution, but there were still plenty of people in the
                    center and a number of people who had at certain stages associated themselves
                    with Marcello Caetano, who had replaced Salazar as Prime Minister for the last
                    six years before the coup. Caetano at times flirted with modernizing reform and
                    there were certain people who associated themselves with that, people like Sa
                    Carneiro, the leader of the PPD, later PSD, who could be viewed as centrist
                    intellectual figures rather than Right-wing or Left-wing. There were leftist
                    intellectuals close to the Socialist Party who mostly sought to influence the
                    Socialist Party from within, but recognized that they had to make a choice
                    against an authoritarian communist party. Because of the polarization caused by
                    many years of dictatorship, the majority of left-leaning intellectuals who
                    stayed in the country, such as the Nobel Prize winning author Jose Saramago,
                    identified with the communist party or its front groups and even took senior
                    positions in those post-revolutionary governments, such as editor of
                    nationalized newspapers. The communist party took advantage of this historically
                    based support from intellectuals in the early years after the revolution.</p>

                        church-dominated country until this revolution. But the revolution itself
                        was rather short lived as far as the Marxism but then it was more
                        profound...</hi>

                <p>SULLIVAN: Portugal changed dramatically, it changed dramatically the four years I
                    was there, and it changed dramatically while my sister lived there for seventeen
                    years subsequently so I visited fairly frequently in that period. Portugal has
                    changed dramatically, Portugal became part of Europe, Portugal ceased to
                    maintain the illusion that it could also be part of Africa through its colonies.
                    Portugal in the period, while I was there, was still largely a very religious
                    country, a country whose northern half, where about two-thirds of the population
                    lived, was composed of mini-fundias, tiny little plots of half an acre or so
                    divided among six children.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds a little bit like Ireland in the period
                        before.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yeah, so you know what to do with the other five but send them off to
                    Africa. Only really in the 1950s and '60s did Portugal begin to encourage
                    substantial emigration to Africa. For so many people, the second to the sixth
                    sons would go to Angola or Mozambique to live or they would go to France or
                    Germany or Switzerland to work as emigrant workers and send money back to
                    support their families. So there were connections to Europe, but Portugal was
                    the most different country by far from the rest of Western Europe. Unlike Spain,
                    which had had a fairly substantial economic growth in the '60s and '70s,
                    Portugal had not, and Portugal was still very much focused on what they called
                    the “Ultramar” the overseas territories. It wasn't totally clear in the first
                    phase of the revolution in April of '74 what was going to happen with the
                    territories. But, by the time Spinola and others were out of the picture in
                    March of '75 there was no question that all of the territories were going to be
                    independent and this was going to be a very different Portugal. The visions of
                    where it would go varied considerably from the Communist vision to the Socialist
                    vision of integrating into the European Union. One of the things that the
                    Europeans could hold out which the Portuguese population wanted was entry into
                    the European Union. They never delivered in the period that I was there, but it
                    was held out and Europeans signed many announcements and commitments,
                    particularly once Mario Soares became prime minister in April/May of 1976, of
                    the EU's concrete intention to move toward making Portugal a member of the
                    European Union. I should add, of course, that Lisbon and Porto were more
                    developed and urbanized places than the rural Portugal that I described above,
                    but they were also poorly integrated into the rest of Europe and much poorer
                    than the rest of Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did these million Portuguese-Africans, how did they
                        fit back in when they came back? I wouldn't think it would be easy to
                        digest...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: It was not easy to digest them but it is surprising how well they were
                    digested. I think there are a couple things to be said about that. One is in
                    some ways the people who went to Angola in particular, because that is where 500
                    thousand of them went, were the most innovative, least hide-bound. So, for
                    instance, even a wealthy person living in Estoril fifteen miles from Lisbon who
                    had a huge piece of land and had riding stables on it; but had a feudal
                    arrangement of about 500 people living on that property who were doing menial
                    tasks and farming their tiny pieces of property in the back of their little
                    huts. That was the way it was in 1976 and this landowner's son had gone to
                    Angola, where he had to invent a new way of doing things. It was this son who
                    then came back and subdivided this property into housing developments and golf
                    courses and shopping centers and helped ensure that Portugal would never be the
                    same.</p>
                <p>So for those who had been feudal estate workers, I don't know just what happened
                    to them. They probably got a job in the construction industry or in the new
                    supermarket, but this influx from Africa was changing Portugal in many ways. The
                    largest single number of returnees from Africa were drivers, drivers of trucks,
                    drivers of taxis because in Angola, black Angolans could not be taxi drivers.
                    White Portuguese who had emigrated to Angola were the taxi drivers. So they
                    brought back with them, their taxis, their trucks and they did some of that
                    business in Portugal. They moved back in with their families to a certain
                    degree, but they also got small loans from us and helped change Portugal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well it sounds whatever it is in a way it was a better

                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: A better reintegration than the French.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I don't have a good explanation for it but I don't think it was a real
                    political elite or a political leadership that returned with that group. That
                    said, the returnees were a factor in making Portugal more conservative
                    politically by adding a million people who had been in Africa and felt
                    themselves dispossessed by the revolution, even though there was a fair number
                    of mixed raced people who came back as well. For the first time Portugal began
                    to be a country with a substantial presence of Africans. The returnees or
                    “retornados” were overall a push in a conservative direction politically
                    vis-�-vis the communists, but a force for change socially.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about some of the other overseas elements, the
                        Americans? Several of the cranberry bogs of Massachusetts and Rhode Island
                        and the Azores.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>SULLLIVAN: Portuguese in the U.S. came predominately from the Azores to New
                    England and to the farming valleys of California. A significant number of
                    Portuguese also came from Aveiro in Northern Portugal and settled in New
                    Jersey.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These are pretty important, I mean they are hard working
                        people and they had some clout didn't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I don't know how much real political influence they had in the U.S.
                    Being from Massachusetts myself, I would say that they could rise at that time
                    to be the mayor of New Bedford or Fall River, but their ability to becoming more
                    important in Massachusetts politics or national politics was limited.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You just said you didn't see any Portuguese names the way
                        you would see Italian names or Irish names.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: No, no. So, one of the most important Portuguese-American political
                    figures was actually the Cardinal of Boston, Medeiros, who visited Portugal
                    probably in about 1977. He was essentially expressing interest and support both
                    for the church and for the Portuguese people on behalf of the American Church
                    and the Portuguese-Americans in the United States. But in terms of either major
                    investments or major political influence in the US, I didn't see it; there was
                    undoubtedly some but I would not say it was major.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's almost struck me from what I gather that the
                        crossover between Spain and Portugal was really rather minimal wasn't it? I
                        mean...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well they are always back-to-back. Every Portuguese hill top town on
                    the border is a walled town to protect historically against the Spanish and
                    their French allies, so there always is a back-to-back element in history in the
                    relationship between the people. That said, the fact that the revolution
                    happened in Portugal first had some effects in Spain. I don't want to pretend to
                    explain the Spanish process but I do think that Franco, the Spanish prime
                    minister and later the King were very alarmed by what was happening in Portugal.
                    Maybe it helped encourage them to move their transition process through more
                    quickly in order to avoid something they would have viewed as catastrophic like
                    what they saw happening across the border, with destruction or socialization of
                    properties.</p>
                <p>I should add that Portugal was a great place to live, to meet Portuguese contacts
                    and friends and to raise a family. Portuguese are great family people and they
                    were terrific with my two young boys. Moreover, with a very weak Portuguese
                    escudo, living was inexpensive and we could travel all over the country.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: The summer of 1979 and I actually spent a year at Yale at that point
                    and had a mid-career academic year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing at Yale?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I took Latin American studies. We had various area studies programs and
                    I did Latin America. I chose Yale in part because my father at that point was
                    becoming ill with what we did not know, but proved to be Alzheimer's. So I
                    wanted to be close enough to be able to get back and forth to Boston, as my
                    family coped with that process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the first place you had just come from probably the
                        most interesting spot in our relations with the most interesting area, which
                        was Europe, the one time when things could have gone bad. Did you come back
                        with a feel of by God we really did something here?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yeah, very much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And also a feel for the process of diplomacy really.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I think on all fronts but I'll just add to that. By the last year
                    there, Portugal had become sufficiently routine-ized and sufficiently stable
                    that it was less interesting, it wasn't as exciting anymore. Yes they might
                    change governments every six months but who cares, the next government does more
                    or less the same as the previous one and isn't going to change policies very
                    much. It's never going to be as unstable or risky as it once was. That said,
                    part of my inspiration in going back to the academic world was to study whether
                    what had happened in Portugal had lessons for other transitions to
                    democracy..</p>
                <p>One of the things I looked at a lot in Yale with Professor Juan Linz, a Spanish
                    professor of political science at Yale, who had written a terrific book on the
                    slippage into fascism and authoritarian rule in Europe before World War II and
                    was also beginning to write on transitions from authoritarian to democratic
                    rule. So I read the literature and also analyzed what I had seen in Portugal and
                    nearby in Spain and Greece and developed some theories about the critical
                    element of early elections to provide a measure of genuine popular support for
                    various political options.</p>

                        academic world and the practitioner.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this strike you or maybe Yale was different?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well people like Juan Linz impressed me very much. This was a person
                    who was very well rooted in reality. His principal academic work prior to that
                    had been on the breakdown of democratic regimes throughout Europe in the period
                    leading up to Nazism and Fascism. Based on concrete examples and then later when
                    he began to get interested in and write about the transitions in the opposite
                    direction, they were very much focused on real developments.</p>
                <p>There was a professor there at the time who was also quite well known and not
                    totally unrealistic, but he showed some tendency to get caught up in the
                    academic theories which strayed far from reality. Al Stepan was the principal
                    Latin Americanist political scientist professor with whom I dealt. I remember he
                    was force-feeding us a book by a Brazilian academic who later became president
                    of Brazil, Fernando Enrique Cardoso. That book propounded that much of the
                    world, especially in Latin America, is explained by “dependencia,” dependence;
                    i.e., that Latin America's failure to become a more mature society was explained
                    by its dependence on the United States and Europe. Something about that theory
                    made me feel like this is really too much of an effort to have an overarching
                    academic theory that explains everything. Fernando Enrique Cardoso, once he
                    became president of Brazil, either no longer adhered to his previous academic
                    theories or did not practice them. He was a very effective president who broke
                    Brazil's traditional inflationary polices. But American academics and
                    particularly this is true with respect to Latin America and Africa, often are
                    very intent on explaining underdevelopment as a function of dependence on the
                    West..</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now this is I think there is an awful lot of rather turgid
                        writing on this too. I've tried picking up a long time ago but on political
                        science. I mean you learn they write for each other and kind of wonder what
                        the hell is this all about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: That said, Yale was a great experience for me professionally. I got to
                    pick and choose my classes and to audit a class by the famous Robert Dahl and
                    other first-class thinkers. There was an economist there, a Latin American
                    economist Carlos Diaz Alessandro who was very good. That was a good experience
                    and for the most part I managed to avoid the theorists and learned from the
                    realists. I had by then realized that a political officer needed a solid grasp
                    of economics and that year helped me gain that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I would have finished at Yale in the summer of 1980 and then came back
                    and worked in Western Hemisphere affairs again, ARA at that point, with Luigi
                    Einaudi who was director of the office of policy planning. I was in that office
                    and, of course, that also straddled the period when Reagan took over the
                    presidency so stepped into a very controversial debate.</p>

                <p>SULLIVAN: Yeah, and I was involved, in that the area that I focused on was

                <p>Today is the first of November, 2010. This is an interview with Joseph Gerard
                    Sullivan and this is being done on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic
                    Studies and Training and I am Charles Stuart Kennedy. All right Joe?</p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I think we finished Portugal as I recall from 1975 through 1979; I was
                    there in the Carlucci period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I was a middle grade political officer and wound up spending four very
                    good years there '75 through '79 in the period where we had a great deal of
                    success and to a certain degree Carlucci gets the main credit for it for
                    resisting the counsel of despair.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Absolutely, I consider this somebody who is doing
                        something else for great moments of American diplomacy. I pointed a lady to
                        the Carlucci period among a few other places.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: That's right; and I wanted to refer again to a book in Portuguese but
                    by a distinguished individual with a policy and academic background. In those
                    years, he was an aide to Mario Soares. Bernardino Gomes's book is called
                    Carlucci Verses Kissinger and he's had access to U.S. documentary files as well
                    as Portuguese and U.S. diplomats and politicians of the time and his book
                    describes this period very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay so in 1979 whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: In 1979, I actually left Portugal and came back for the mid-career year
                    of academic studies, as we discussed a bit earlier. This was an interesting year
                    from a personal development perspective. Having been in the business for nine
                    years, I recognized the importance of a better economic background so I took
                    some credits in economics and also audited some courses in economics so that I
                    understood economics better. As a political officer or a senior officer, it was
                    very important for me to understand what was happening in an economy, as had
                    been the case in Portugal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you sense a distance between yourself and the academic
                        types as far as how you looked at the world?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yeah there is to a certain extent, particularly with respect to Latin
                    America, a tendency to explain all things Latin American as a function of the
                    United States. The academic theory, as I mentioned earlier, was called
                    “Dependencia”, Dependency, which explains most thing bad that happened in Latin
                    America as due to their dependence on the West and particularly the United
                    States. But, there were a number of more pragmatic academics out there and I
                    gravitated to those that I thought were more pragmatic.. So it was a good
                    experience over all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay this would put you about 1980.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I returned to the Department of State and worked in the Inter-American
                    bureau in the policy planning office for two years. The then director of the
                    office was Dr. Luigi Einaudi, who was a civil service rather than Foreign
                    Service employee and had a background at the RAND Institute.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Later he actually became for a brief time acting secretary general of
                    the OAS; but in any case, he was a brilliant fellow and I learned a lot from
                    him. It was a very controversial time with respect to Latin America in that in
                    those two years you saw a very polarized view with the Carter administration
                    taking a view that emphasized human rights and reluctance to work with countries
                    that had human rights violations. But then the Sandinistas took over in
                    Nicaragua and this provoked a negative reaction in the U.S. The Carter
                    Administrations was seeking to reach some sort of accommodation with the
                    Sandinistas in Nicaragua in which they would not seek to spread their revolution
                    further. Then you had the Reagan election and then a foreign policy change that
                    was most pronounced with respect to Latin America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, the Latin American place fell to the full bronco, the
                        Reagan administration...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: That's right, the assistant secretary, several of the deputy assistant
                    secretaries and even some office directors were virtually given overnight to
                    pack their bags and move out. Even Luigi went off for an academic sojourn at the
                    Wilson Institute because it was reasonably uncomfortable to have this radical
                    change and a view that the previous administration and every Foreign Service and
                    civil service officer who had worked in senior positions on Latin America in the
                    Carter administration should be cleaned out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well going back to the time though that you were with
                        policy planning, policy planning always sounds great in the Department of
                        State but it can mean a multitude of things including doing the windows or
                        writing speeches. What was policy planning in the Latin America bureau
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: You are right that there was lots of speech writing, in part because
                    Luigi was a great speech writer and because that is the traditional function of
                    policy planning as the means for defining policy. There was also a certain
                    amount of policy reflection; which tended to be less country specific than
                    regional. Because Luigi had such a long history in Latin America he was
                    consulted as a valuable resource as long as he was there. I wound up principally
                    focusing on Central America which was, indeed, the hottest of issues over that
                    period but less on the most controversial change in policy, the decision to
                    support the Contras in Nicaragua. This decision was basically held very closely
                    and dealt with elsewhere in the Bureau and with the Agency. But our policy
                    planning shop did work on several issues that I found interesting and, in the
                    long run, beneficial, particularly on El Salvador. The U.S. encouraged and
                    pressed for free and fair elections to be held in El Salvador and our policy
                    planning office had the lead in that effort. We arranged for several American
                    election experts, Richard Scammon and Howard Penniman, to provide advice to the
                    El Salvadoran election commission on what needed to be done to ensure free and
                    fair elections and they did much to make the elections credible. My office and I
                    also pressed for international election observers to be invited and then urged
                    other governments to send observer missions, all this at a time before such
                    international election observation was common, particularly in a place that
                    still had an internal armed conflict underway.</p>
                <p>The U.S. also put together its own team of election observers and I was the chief
                    Washington staff support for this team. Tom Enders was Assistant Secretary for
                    Inter-American Affairs and properly interested in having the U.S. observer
                    mission be viewed as bi-partisan. Accordingly, the Congressional observers were
                    not only Republican Senator Nancy Kassebaum and Republican Congressman Bob
                    Livingston, but also Democratic Congressman Jack Murtha, a close ally of then
                    Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill. A brilliant non-political member was Father
                    Ted Hesburgh, President of Notre Dame University. Tom Enders probably got out in
                    front of the Reagan Administration by including the Chancellor of the University
                    of California system Clark Kerr, who had had some legendary confrontations with
                    then Governor Ronald Reagan. As a result, the U.S. observers got no White House
                    meeting prior to their departure for El Salvador. In the end, the election went
                    well, showed tremendous electorate participation, showed Salvadorans willing to
                    brave guerrilla threats against voting and to wait for hours in line in order to
                    vote. The U.S. observer team was duly impressed and testified widely to their
                    favorable impressions. Many of the observer group bonded closely, with former
                    Marine Jack Murtha and Father Hesburgh getting along famously and Senator
                    Kassebaum being one of the few Senators who could overcome the usual suspicions
                    of House members that a Senator would steal all the publicity. In the end, the
                    White House was so pleased that the U.S. observer delegation was invited to the
                    White House to report their observations to President Reagan. The results of
                    that 1982 election were only an initial, but an important building block to a
                    later peace settlement that settled the conflict with the guerrillas and toward
                    building democratic institutions, but they did make clear that the Salvadoran
                    public, as poor and uneducated as many were, wanted to exercise their right to
                    choose their own leaders - a lesson for the non-democrats on the left and the
                    right.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got there in 1980 how did you view the El
                        Salvador conflict? Where did you think it was going and what was causing
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Your question is very relevant. El Salvador had a history of repressive
                    Right Wing authoritarian governments closely allied with the military who saw
                    their principal role as reinforcing the role of dominant families that were the
                    major powers source in that country. The U.S. had historically not been very
                    close to the Salvadoran governments, but had also done little or nothing to
                    press these authoritarian governments to open to democracy. From academia, it
                    appeared clear what problem had created conditions for a leftist guerrilla
                    movement, which after 1979, also received major assistance from the Sandinista
                    Government in Nicaragua to the point that it represented a serious threat to the
                    El Salvador Government. But coming to work on the problem practically as opposed
                    to at an academic distance, Luigi Einaudi's focus and my focus was on what could
                    be done practically to build a peaceful, democratic and prosperous El Salvador.
                    Napoleon Duarte, a Christian Democrat Centrist, who had been prevented from
                    becoming president by previous authoritarian governments, was serving as the
                    interim president. He and others with democratic credentials were committed to
                    organizing free and fair elections and those individuals seemed like solid bases
                    that we should build upon and support. Now, separately the Reagan Administration
                    was increasing military support for the El Salvadoran armed forces. Even the
                    Carter administration had come to the decision very late in its term, that
                    notwithstanding the negative human rights record of the Salvadorian military,
                    there was no alternative but to provide them support to prevent a revolutionary
                    and undemocratic guerrilla movement from gaining power.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking about the Carter period now. As you were
                        working on the problem there did you find that the European Socialist
                        governments all were sort of a little bit starry eyed about what was
                        happening or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yes, to a certain degree, particularly because the Salvadoran Armed
                    Forces and Right Wing elements which had dominated El Salvador until 1980 had,
                    in effect, driven the small Salvadoran Social Democratic party into an alliance
                    with the armed guerrillas. Social Democratic politicians in El Salvador who were
                    not up in arms wound up aligning themselves with the guerrillas and, therefore,
                    the Social Democrats in Europe and Latin America had some inclination to follow
                    that lead, notwithstanding the recent Nicaraguan example of democratic
                    politicians getting swallowed up or ignored by armed Sandinistas. So it resulted
                    in a difficult enterprise for the United States to encourage European socialists
                    to work toward a long-term democratic solution and not expect that something
                    positive was likely to come out of a guerrilla victory. I think that among
                    social democrats in Latin America, the case was made easier by the early 1980's
                    after the Sandinistas had taken power in 1979 and had shown that their own
                    democratic credentials were not very good at all and that Social Democratic and
                    other allies in Nicaragua were essentially being pushed aside while the
                    Sandinistas concentrated power in their own hands.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Cubans; how did we see what they were up
                        to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well very negatively. There was a good degree of not just intelligence,
                    but publicly documented evidence of Cuban training and arms supply for leftist
                    guerrillas in Central America. And the Reagan administration had no inclination
                    to work with the Cubans whatsoever. You recall Alexander Haig's quote early on
                    as secretary of State that he was going to go to the source of the problem in
                    Central America, which was a not very implicit threat against Cuba. Not that we
                    ever did anything effective in that sense but the inclination was obviously
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You started there when the Sandinistas had just taken
                        control?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Correct. Yeah, I think I arrived about in September 1980 they had taken
                    power in 1979.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there at all a feeling, maybe not on your part, but
                        with people in Central America and in the Foreign Service, but particularly
                        on the political left and the Democratic left that maybe the Sandinistas
                        were going to be people that we could work with and that this wasn't
                        particularly a bad thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well there certainly was some ambivalence on that subject, and where I
                    had come from in academia, I think there was a lot of hope that the fall of
                    Somoza and the takeover by the Sandinistas would wind up being a good thing.
                    Because in the past I had been backup Nicaragua desk officer, I certainly had
                    lots of antipathy towards Somoza and believed that he had been the root cause of
                    many of the problems that beset Nicaragua. I think we talked about this in our
                    last session.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: But that said, were the Sandinistas a group that we really could work
                    with? The Carter administration sought to negotiate with them fairly ineptly, as
                    I reviewed the literature and talked to people, but there were good solid people
                    like Larry Pezzullo who was the ambassador of the Carter administration during
                    the fall of Somoza and the victory of the Sandinistas who tried to put together
                    some formula that would put pluralist and democratic constraints around a
                    post-Somoza government. Once the Sandinistas had prevailed, Pezzullo and later
                    Reagan Administration negotiators, led by Harry Shlaudeman, had tried to work
                    out some agreements to the effect that the Sandinistas would do nothing to
                    support guerrillas elsewhere in Central America. But at the end of the day, it
                    was not to be; the Sandinistas were not prepared to give up their domination of
                    power, nor their support for like-minded revolutionary forces in the region,
                    such as the Salvadorian guerrillas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well during this, we will still stick with the latter days
                        of the Carter period in Central America. Were you feeling the heavy hand of
                        Jesse Helms and sort of the Right Wing of the Republican Party on what you
                        were up to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well I was probably at to low a level too feel that directly, but there
                    were things coming out such as the Santa Fe Document at the end of the Carter
                    Administration. Retired General Sumner who had been behind that and that was
                    essentially blaming the Carter administration for having lost Nicaragua and
                    calling for a much more assertive U.S. policy in the region. So there were
                    certainly reason to believe that if Reagan won the elections, there were going
                    to be major, major changes with respect to Central American policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you too far removed? I was wondering if you had any
                        contact with Helms' staff at all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Not at that period; at a later period yes. One of the things about
                    policy planning is that generally the contacts are less direct with
                    Congressional staff than they are at the desk. I think the one time that we had
                    some degree of contact was in preparing for this election observer mission since
                    there was Congressional participation in that.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the Salvadoran election, as you put it, came off quite
                        well didn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN; Yeah, yeah, I mean in balance now that the critique certainly from the
                    European Left of that election was that the wrong party won or that Right Wing
                    Forces won and Christian Democrats did not. That said, the election reinforced a
                    pragmatic centrist continuity there. So it was a process not only of which side
                    of the political spectrum should prevail, but whether civilians could gradually
                    and over time get greater authority in running their own government. This was an
                    early step in that process and it certainly showed that the Salvadorians wanted
                    to decide on their own governance. I remember doing an interview at that time
                    with a leftist American media interviewer whose premise was that Salvadorans are
                    too uneducated and too unprepared to run their own affairs and decide who should
                    run their own affairs. Of course, I disagreed with that. People determine their
                    own interests and certainly they should be allowed to have that choice. The
                    Salvadorans did and around the 85 percent of the population actually voted
                    despite guerrilla threats to disrupt the election.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there within the specialists dealing with the Central
                        American in the State Department were there any splits about whether Central
                        America, particularly El Salvador, and all or was it pretty much a group
                        that pretty much saw things the same way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Let's see. I guess I would say I think there was within if I were to
                    make a broad characterization and the biggest splits were with respect to
                    Nicaragua rather than with respect to El Salvador. In the Carter administration
                    I would say that the differences were probably ones of State Department with the
                    exception of Human Rights Assistant Secretary Patt Derian looking for pragmatic
                    ways forward and for centrist options to pursue. The White House did not differ
                    philosophically as much as it was very much hands on and not very adept in how
                    they managed that process. Then when we got into the Reagan administration,
                    there was a purge of career people who had previously had responsibilities,
                    including of the Carter Administration's Ambassador to El Salvador, Bob White,
                    all the Deputy Assistant Secretaries and even Office Directors. The people who
                    came in were mostly of one mind with respect to El Salvador, with perhaps some
                    differences to the degree of military support and military emphasis that should
                    be attributed to addressing the El Salvador problem. With respect to Nicaragua
                    there were greater differences revolving whether the Contras could be viewed as
                    the solution to the Nicaragua problem. So even then, for instance, you had Tom
                    Enders, the Reagan administration assistant secretary looking for pragmatic
                    solutions, and holding a number of dialogues with the Sandinistas. Harry
                    Shlaudeman also went down there a number of times, but the Reagan administration
                    was very, very much polarized over Nicaragua with many, many splits among the
                    NSC, the State Department, the Defense Department and the Congress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I realize you were down below the line of fire between the
                        two administrations...</hi>

                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...but when the Reagan administration came in did you all
                        in your position take a look at this and say, “Oh my God, we have to be
                        pretty careful about what we say and what we report because we might get
                        caught in the political crossfire”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well in Washington our job was to help craft the policy pronouncements
                    of whatever U.S. government was elected. So the day after the U.S. election, I
                    remember Luigi Einaudi having a meeting in his office and leading a discussion
                    of how we should deal with this. We had to try to do the best we could to make
                    sure that sensible policy emerged, that pragmatic policy emerged, that ideology
                    not trump all. So I would say sure that wound up being the direction and yet
                    because Luigi was relatively high-profile even though I don't think he had a
                    political party identification, he wound up having to take six months or a year
                    off at the Wilson Center to get the spotlight off himself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did you continue with the Reagan group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well I was there in Latin American policy planning until the summer of
                    1982 and then I moved up for one year as a special assistant for the then
                    counselor of the department James Buckley, the former senator.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How as that? Again the counselor job can be a handy person
                        type job or not. How was it with Buckley?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well I guess I would say he was largely cut out and he really only
                    stayed about three months after I moved into his office. He left and was
                    succeeded by Ed Derwinski with whom I worked the rest of the year that I spent
                    in that office. Jim Buckley was a real gentleman, a nice person, very
                    conservative, but certainly a reasonable interlocutor. I will tell you one
                    little story about Jim Buckley, originally from Sharon, Connecticut, and then
                    was based in New York where he had been elected to one term in the US Senate.
                    Jim Buckley was a bastion of East Coast Catholicism, he and his brother Bill.
                    Reagan was the first, I believe, to ever name a Catholic to be the Special Envoy
                    to the Vatican. The position didn't have full ambassadorial title; that person
                    was Bill Wilson who was a bastion of West Coast, California Catholicism. So I
                    happened to be present as special assistant to Buckley at his first meeting with
                    Wilson. They were meeting each other for the first time and clearly feeling each
                    other out but very politely. So Buckley asked Wilson how are things, how much
                    time do you spend out there in Rome. About that time the U.S. envoy would only
                    spend about six months a year at the Vatican. Wilson replied, “Oh, about six
                    months and maybe another three months in California and then another three
                    months in New York; but you know overall it's okay because I have residences in
                    all of those places.” And Jim Buckley knew exactly how to make the appropriately
                    sympathetic noises and responded, “Well, yeah, yeah I know how it is. You can't
                    find the sweater you are looking for in the house where you are at the moment.”
                    So the East and West Coast branches of Catholicism had come together on that
                    issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well the problems of the rich.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yes indeed. I never would have known how to respond appropriately.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Derwinski? He was sort of an elemental force
                        wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yeah he was certainly he was a character, he was self-appointed, during
                    his 24-year Congressional career, as representative of ethnic groups,
                    particularly from Chicago, his home base and the Chicago suburbs. Then he had
                    been redistricted out of his seat so the Reagan administration took him in and
                    gave him a place at State once Buckley decided to leave. I learned a lot from Ed
                    Derwinski because he knew the Congress very well and he took me along on his
                    meetings with Congress people. In the eight or so months I worked with him, he
                    did not become a major force within the Department and he didn't focus on major
                    issues within the Department. He loved doing his old Congressional stuff and he
                    had always done a lot of international travel, a lot of working with
                    international organizations, particularly the international parliamentary union.
                    I went on my one trip with him to Vienna for one meeting sand then also to
                    Hungary that had to deal with his contacts with both Hungarian immigrants to the
                    U.S. as well as Romania, since there is a Hungarian ethnic group in Romania that
                    he was active on behalf of. He was also active with Armenian immigrant groups,
                    so I know I met with the Armenian patriarch based in Beirut when he visited the
                    U.S. So I learned a lot about politics within the U.S. and the Congress and the
                    ethnic factors in US politics. Ed Derwinski, as a Polish-American and had a
                    fundamentally anti-Communist approach to all of these things. The Armenian
                    patriarch who was based in Beirut got preference in his eyes over the Armenian
                    patriarch who was based in present day Armenia because the latter would have
                    been, in his view, obviously dominated and perhaps even selected by the Soviet
                    Union. But it was interesting; it was certainly enlightening for me on how to
                    get things done in the Congress.</p>
                <p>Ed also got active that in that period on the creation of the National Endowment
                    for Democracy; the funding which later went to the International Republican
                    Institute, the National Democratic Institute is part of that. Mark Palmer who
                    was a key figure in Larry Eagleburger's office, the undersecretary for political
                    affairs, was a major force in the Westminster speech by Reagan expressing
                    support for democracy and the National Endowment for Democracy became the overt
                    U.S. means for democracy support. Ed Derwinski was asked to help persuade some
                    of his Republican Congressional friends that they should go along with this
                    proposal, because many of their instincts were not to do this. They didn't want
                    to go down the path that the Germans had with their political foundations and
                    some didn't want to really get that involved in international affairs and didn't
                    want to help create a new bureaucracy. Even Ed Derwinski had his doubts because
                    of his fiscal conservatism. But at the end of the day, Congress was persuaded
                    that on balance, it was a good thing and Ed provided some support that was
                    useful in helping get the funding for this. The National Endowment for Democracy
                    became an institution with which I worked very closely a decade later on
                    Nicaragua.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes it could be quite useful particularly with the Soviet
                        Union falling apart.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yeah, yeah.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: And it also gave us vehicles to establish better relationships with
                    Social Democratic parties in Europe, particularly the Democrat Party doing that
                    and the Republican Party with the Conservative and Christian Democratic parties;
                    party relationships that had not really been there before. Relationships among
                    the European parties were very well established but we didn't really have a
                    vehicle prior to that to have a continuing relationship that went beyond
                    personal connections.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I wound up bidding on and receiving an assignment to Tel Aviv via one
                    year of Hebrew language training so I went to FSI and studied Hebrew for about
                    eight months or so. By about March, I had really pretty much maxed out in terms
                    of what FSI could teach me so I was able to persuade FSI to give me an
                    additional two months in Israel at what they call an ULPAN, a language learning
                    institute. This ULPA was conducted at a little one star hotel on the beach in
                    Netanya and I learned with other people, who were mostly new or not so new
                    immigrants. My roommate was a Bulgarian immigrant who had actually already been
                    in country ten years but was coming back to improved his Hebrew. So Hebrew was
                    the only common language we had and so we spoke in Hebrew. Certainly it was a
                    good experience for my language and by the time I moved down to Tel Aviv
                    permanently in late June or early July of 1984 my language was pretty good. At
                    that point, having Hebrew was fairly important. While there have always have
                    been plenty of English speakers in Israel, particularly at that point, the new
                    immigrants and my political counter parts, people in the Knesset who had been
                    born in the Middle Eastern, Arabic-speaking countries or North Africa typically
                    didn't have English so it was very useful. The Embassy had maybe only about
                    eight or so positions designated as Hebrew language positions. One of them was
                    mine in the political section as the deputy political counselor with a
                    particular focus on internal politics. So I visited the Knesset and government
                    offices frequently, where I used my Hebrew regularly.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: The summer of 1984 until the summer of 1988. Sam Lewis was the
                    ambassador my first year there and then Tom Pickering my next three years. My
                    political counselor the first year was Paul Hare who later went on to several
                    ambassadorships and then later Roger Harrison for two years and then actually I
                    moved up and became political counselor my fourth year there with Tom
                    Pickering's support.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went out there in 1984 how stood matters in
                        Israel at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yeah well they were just having an election actually that summer and
                    that was the point at which the previous system of Likud or Labor domination of
                    politics was breaking down irreparably in a way that each party was subsequently
                    only getting forty or so of the 120 seats in the Knesset and therefore were ever
                    more dependent on small party alliances. Because in that 1984 election, Labor
                    and Likud finished in a virtual dead-heat, neither one of them was able to form
                    an alliance with the small parties. Instead they decided on a grand coalition
                    and the two parties would alternate in power with Shimon Peres being prime
                    minister the first two years and Yitzhak Shamir the Likud leader being foreign
                    minister. Yitzhak Rabin would be defense minister the whole four years and then
                    at the two year point Shamir and Peres changed positions. Now at the end of the
                    day at least as far as broader issues the peace process, what the unity
                    government amounted to was a formula for deadlock. Likud was always able to
                    stymie Peres' ambitions to promote a peace process whether he was prime minister
                    or foreign minister. Shamir probably didn't have much interest in advancing a
                    peace process in any case and was certainly not going to participate in such a
                    venture even when George Shultz came over and made a major push late in the
                    Reagan Administration.. Shamir and Peres both distrusted each other so much on
                    those fundamental issues that there was very little movement on peace process
                    issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the small parties like the religious parties
                        with other parties? Were they able to throw their weight around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well less so than the more normal government in which either Labor or
                    Likud used to be dependent on them because Labor and Likud had some eighty votes
                    between them the weight of the smaller parties was less. That said, because both
                    of the large parties were looking at the future, the coalition included, as I
                    recall, that at least some of the religious and other small parties within the
                    Grand Coalition continued to direct resources and benefits their way looking at
                    the future and when they might need them again for future coalition building
                    efforts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the party system? Well let's
                        talk about the smaller parties first since you were dealing with them on a
                        personal basis.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well it was a system which essentially did work in a very advantageous
                    position for small parties to get their benefits, particularly if their benefits
                    were narrow benefits, money to fund Yeshivas, religious teaching programs, money
                    to support their own party building in the guise of social institutions and so
                    on. It was a situation which elsewhere in the world is rare, but small parties
                    in Israel have great leverage. Even bearing in mind that I was in Israel at the
                    relative low point of their leverage, the small parties still had the ability to
                    get their way and the large parties saw it in their interest to throw
                    substantial resources their way in the interest of having a good
                    relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you find that the small parties had much interest
                        in trying to manipulate the United States or were they playing their own
                        game and we were outside their orbit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I think probably the less small parties I would say settler groups were
                    in that period that I was there just beginning to cultivate in a major way U.S.
                    political forces to try to take sides in this issue of whether or not Israel
                    should be discouraged from or encouraged to settle in the West Bank in Gaza.
                    Settler groups had some success in their efforts at that point. I remember
                    Senator Jesse Helms actually came over and visited. I don't recall whether he
                    even took a briefing from the ambassador; we certainly would have offered one.
                    But his trip would have been paid for by a Christian interest group in the
                    United States that had a special relationship with Jewish settler groups in
                    Israel and the West Bank. And Helms's views were further encouraged to be very
                    supportive on behalf of settlers; so this was a relatively new phenomenon. As
                    far as other groups and other parties, Peace Now was beginning to emerge at that
                    point and they had sort of some natural allies within both liberal forces in the
                    U.S. as well as within liberal Jewish organizations but I don't think they were
                    as active or as effective in cultivating U.S. allies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Israeli Arab group was it at all effective or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Let's see, there was to some degree I recall at that point there were
                    about seven Israeli-Arab members of the Knesset, seven or eight, somewhere in
                    there. About four of them were Communist Party which effectively made them
                    really ineffective. They were excluded from all security matters and, as a
                    matter of fact, all Israeli-Arabs were excluded from knowledge of security
                    matters and had virtually no real influence on foreign policy issues. The Labor
                    party had several Israeli-Arabs, who had a little bit more influence. But
                    overall at that point, you were dealing with a group that was so small that
                    their ability to influence matters was quite small.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there during the last year or so of Sam Lewis
                        weren't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I was there his last year, yeah. My principal recollection of that
                    period is that we were still I would say, clinging to the hope that an agreement
                    that had been forged between Israel and Lebanon with US brokerage could somehow
                    be maintained, even as it was breaking apart under our eyes. It had been
                    brokered by the U.S. in about '83 in the aftermath of the '82 mess in Beirut.
                    Israel agreed to mostly depart from Lebanon and yet be able to maintain security
                    in south Lebanon. Sam's last year and my first year witnessed the collapse of
                    any hope that that agreement would have any real importance in the longer
                    run..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During that period what was the status of Ariel Sharon and
                        how did we view him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLLIVAN: Sharon was at least the first part of that period very much on the
                    outs. His stature was much reduced because of the nightmare that the invasion of
                    Lebanon had resulted in was and the internal Israeli investigations which had
                    blamed him for the Sabra and Shatila massacre of Palestinians. He was much
                    diminished in political stature, but in the course of my four years was
                    rehabilitated and eventually incorporated into the collation government in a
                    considered relatively minor role as minister of commerce. So from being somebody
                    who had been a major figure, he became a minor figure. His ego didn't diminish
                    and he still came into receptions with a large retinue of people and certainly
                    whenever I would accompany visiting Congress people to meet with him, he
                    certainly spoke as if he was a major figure. But I think that was probably his
                    low point of political power and it took him some time thereafter to build his
                    status back up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find various groups, particularly
                        Congressional groups and other ones, coming to Israel? I mean by this time
                        this was a part of the ebb and flow of serving in Israel wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Sure, I mean I'm not sure I can give a number but I would guess that it
                    would probably have been maybe as many as 100 Congress people a year counting
                    the numbers that came in groups. Others, like Congressman Steve Solarz and
                    Senator Arlen Specter came every single year. Solarz used to ask for about 30
                    meetings in the course of three days and he wanted every meeting to last exactly
                    45 minutes, transport fifteen minutes to the next meeting and right on through
                    his agenda. So it was a part of a very intense workload and it often involved
                    our organizing some events for visiting members of congress in addition to me or
                    another control officer being the embassy notetaker. It was more ambiguous if
                    they came under private sponsorship as did Senator Helms for instance and we
                    typically did not accompany those groups or might only have a briefing for them.
                    Congressman Charlie Wilson also came often in that period and he also knew his
                    way around Israel very well, had lots of very good Israeli connections, was
                    chairman of armed services appropriations subcommittee and he basically did his
                    own thing. Yes, we received him at the airport and asked him if there was
                    anything he wanted. He always came on a military plane and was accompanied by a
                    military assistant but he didn't ask much from the embassy and preferred all of
                    this meetings private. But I or someone from the embassy did accompany if there
                    was a ministerial level meeting and the Ambassador would accompany to a meeting
                    with the Prime Minister.</p>
                <p>So everybody would want to see Rabin as defense minister and then the prime
                    minister and the foreign minister Shamir and Peres and those were interesting
                    and good meetings. The American Congress people were there because it was
                    important for them and their constituents and their supporters that they go.
                    Probably only a few of them were critical of Israeli ever in meetings, there
                    were a handful that were, such as David Bonior and Howard Wolpe, but most
                    members tended to be unreservedly supportive, even in the midst of the first
                    “Intifada”. Many Israeli politicians sought to use those meetings in order to
                    encourage more Congressional support. I always had great admiration for Rabin
                    because he was very much a straight-shooter even though the first “Intifada” was
                    starting at that time. He used to downplay the threat of that “Intifada” saying
                    that it was a tactical problem that posed no threat to the existence of Israel.
                    His assessment at that time was that the existential threat for Israel was in
                    the East, Syria and Iraq. If they were to combine, this could be an existential
                    threat and that was what Israel should concern itself with most. He would say
                    this to some of the Congress people who were prepared to view every single
                    threat as an existential threat to Israel, but Rabin was not playing to that
                    audience, he was calling it straight.</p>

                <p>SULLIVAN: Well say 1985 in Tel Aviv, Israel.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah. So you had an Israeli government which was sort of

                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: A unity government with both Labor and Likud 50 percent each and
                    alternating the prime minister positions but, in fact, at least on peace process
                    issues it became a formula for stalemate. The U.S. made a number of efforts, I
                    would guess most notably in 1987 and 1988 when Secretary of State Shultz made a
                    major visit out and tried to push the process forward. In fact, by that point,
                    Shamir was the Likud Party's, Yitzhak Shamir was prime minister and he
                    essentially wasn't interested; so things did not advance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well Shultz came out full of, what I gather, full of drive
                        and really going to do it. You had our ambassador in Syria, his name escapes
                        me right now, Bob... I want to say Bob Paganelli but anyway saying Assad
                        wasn't going to do anything, and from what I gather, with Shamir. What
                        caused Shultz to come out into a no win situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yeah, well I mean there is a sort of a continuing impulse on the part
                    of the American administrations to do something; to press, to do whatever is
                    possible, because they recognized that it was a corrosive situation to have no
                    peace process underway. If I recall correctly the Palestinian first Intifada had
                    begun in 1986 or '87 so that really was, I think, one of the factors providing
                    some impulse. In addition, by then Labor Party leader Shimon Peres had become
                    foreign minister and he was very anxious for the U.S. to move and so he was
                    encouraging the U.S. to make an effort. Yet, of course, without Likud being in
                    agreement there was no prospect that it would move. Likud and Shamir were
                    usually, let's say, careful enough not to say no, they would just not say yes.
                    So at the end of the day as I recall Shultz only came once. He had pre-missions
                    come out with various members of peace party planning process that had come out
                    and done pre-meetings, but at the end of the day Shamir was not going to agree
                    so the U.S. peace process faded from the scene and I don't think Shultz ever
                    made a second serious trip out, at least not on that subject.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>Now Syria was not really involved in the Palestinian process at that stage
                    because they really weren't a player. It would have been the Palestinians and
                    some lingering efforts to involve Jordan in an agreement on the Palestinians.
                    There had been some efforts to have them, in fact, be the spokesperson for the
                    Palestinians but I think Palestinians were increasingly clear that they didn't
                    want the Jordanians as their front person and, therefore, any effort needed to
                    have a Palestinian lead. Shimon Peres, in particular, retained some hopes of
                    having the Jordanians out front. Also, Likud in particular within the Israeli
                    government was not going to take the encouraging facilitative actions that
                    Shultz was presenting as necessary in order to move forward.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well at the embassy had we written off or were we just
                        going through the motions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well you know Tom Pickering is a terrific person and certainly the best
                    ambassador I've ever had. But he is a very enthusiastic and positive person who
                    I think never would have discouraged anybody. I've seen him in conversations
                    with Israelis who can be extremely tough and basically say a flat no and Tom
                    would always say, “Well how about this and can't we work it this way, can't we
                    do this.” So I believe Tom was encouraging and at least making the effort. Yeah,
                    probably the embassy was being at least positive, we should try and the
                    secretary had a full peace process staff which had some of the usual actors,
                    including Aaron Miller and Dan Kurtzer.</p>
                <p>Another interesting time was when Vice President Bush made a major trip out to
                    the region in '87, as I recall. It clearly was a pre-Presidential trip in order
                    to position himself as a foreign policy expert, which he was to a substantial
                    degree. Yet he had not had previously, I think, terrific relationships with the
                    Israelis so that trip was among other things to burnish his credentials in all
                    the countries of the region and most importantly in the U.S. I don't think he
                    took major out front positions, it was a fact-finding trip, it was a make
                    contact trip and from his point of view went well. I happened to be the control
                    officer for that visit. It's always a bit of adventure dealing with the staff
                    because by that point the White House had begun to use advance parties who had
                    no international experience. In many cases, they were the people who had
                    advanced previous U.S. campaign trips and were rewarded with advancing an
                    international trip. That was, in this case, particularly confusing because one
                    advance group came out and worked with the embassy over several days with the
                    embassy always presenting ideas of things that can be done, how they can be
                    done. This advance group had their own ideas but we tried to make things work in
                    a practical fashion. After we worked through maybe a three or four day visit of
                    advance party number one, lo and behold about a week later comes advance party
                    number two that had clearly never consulted with advance party number one, had a
                    totally different agenda and we had to do it all over again. So I think that's
                    the practice that as far as I know has continued at least did continue for the
                    next ten or dozen years through both political parties in the White House but
                    made things that much more complicated for an embassy that's trying to work a
                    visit.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>I recall one meeting with the Vice President's advance party, Embassy
                    representatives and the Israeli Protocol and Knesset officials over arrangements
                    for Bush's principal speech at the Israeli Knesset. All seemed to be going well
                    until the Vice President's advance party proposed removing the Knesset podium's
                    national Menorah seal to be replaced by a Vice Presidential seal. So I told him,
                    “No, I don't think you can do that.” He still was very insistent so I said, “If
                    you still want to talk about it, raise it, but you will get a very strong
                    reaction here in the Knesset and they'll want to maintain their symbol of their
                    state. Eventually it got worked out and the Knesset seal stayed on the podium,
                    but it reflects the naivety of some of the people that do the advance work.</p>
                <p>Let's see I guess the one other memorable feature was the Jonathan Pollard spy
                    scandal in which he was, of course, arrested in the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this during your time he was arrested?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yes, I can't remember in late 1985 and into 1986.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: He was arrested and the Israelis, of course, were intimately involved
                    and at quite high levels. A senior Israeli intelligence figure had orchestrated
                    the espionage and utilized as one of the people who made contacts with Pollard
                    an Israeli air force hero of the bombing of the nuclear reactor in Baghdad. The
                    Israelis clearly seduced Pollard with that and with money; he became an agent
                    and delivered materials to the Israeli Government.</p>
                <p>Now the period where the embassy got involved was after Pollard's arrest when the
                    Embassy and the US pressed the Israeli's to cooperate in the investigation and
                    prosecution. The Israelis cooperated to a certain degree in identifying
                    individuals who might have been involved, I think out of embarrassment and fear
                    of its effect on relations with the US. There was a team sent out that included
                    State Department then Legal Adviser Abe Sofaer, Justice Department officials and
                    Joseph diGenova from the U.S. attorney's office prosecuting the case. We had a
                    half a dozen meetings typically starting at about 11:00 p.m. in Jerusalem. We
                    would go through three or four hours in stages, they later brought out some of
                    the individuals who had been involved and those individuals answered questions
                    from our side. So there was some degree of cooperation.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>Now in a situation like that about how it had happened, what degree of
                    involvement there was, the prosecution always wants more information and I think
                    at a certain point the Israelis decided they had provided enough and were not
                    interested in cooperating any further. That may have already been after the
                    first set of visits I don't recall precisely but it was a very tense period in
                    the relationship. The Secretary of Defense, at the time I recall, Caspar
                    Weinberger was particularly upset and it cost Israel a certain degree of
                    collaboration from the U.S. for at least a period, until there was a decision
                    made, notwithstanding this case, that it was in our interest to resume most
                    levels of cooperation with Israel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm not overly familiar with this but my understanding on
                        the Pollard case is that Pollard had been tasked by his Israeli masters to
                        supply on an urgent basis naval intelligence concerning the location of our
                        nuclear launching submarines? I read this in an article by Seymour Hirsch of
                        the New York Times.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>If that's true the only conclusion one can make is that this was being passed on
                    to the Soviets because the Israelis couldn't give a damn where our launching
                    submarines were but the Soviets did. The Israeli's were going through a lot of
                    negotiations to get people out of the Soviet Union at the time. Was this at all
                    a subject that was considered by or batted around the embassy at all?</p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I don't recall that specific information and I don't recall us getting
                    into the specific details of the information provided and certainly not in the
                    meetings with the Israelis that I was part of.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have to look on the Internet to see a little more
                        because if the information he was supplying was, as I said, of our nuclear
                        stuff that has horrific connotations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I think the understanding at the time, unless there was other
                    information I wasn't aware of or that became known later, was that most of the
                    information he was seeking was information about capabilities of their potential
                    enemies and potential threats to them. We always had a certain degree of sharing
                    with Israel, but Israel always presumed that we didn't share everything so they
                    were always anxious to get information in other ways to supplement whatever we
                    did provide.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's an interesting case. I know the American military,
                        particularly in the higher reaches, have been and continue to be absolutely
                        adamant about not releasing Pollard. So there has to be something more than
                        just a garden variety spy, I would think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I don't know the answer to that.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the Pickering time what was your piece of the
                        action?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well, I continued to be the deputy political counselor for the first
                    two years he was there; my second and third years there, and I was principally
                    focused primarily on internal political issues, which in Israel always involved
                    a lot of foreign policy and a fair bit on relations with the U.S. as well. So I
                    continued to follow internal Israeli politics, trying to interpret it as well as
                    I could, try to establish good relationships with a full range of Israeli actors
                    and seeking to get a little bit of advance information on what was likely to
                    happen in the local scene and how it might affect us. This applied to specific
                    issues we were working on the peace process, what were the effects of the
                    Intifada, as well as coalition politics. Then finally, my fourth year there, I
                    became political counselor so I had a broader sense of responsibilities and less
                    specifically internal as somebody else took over most of that portfolio.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well as you were looking at internal politics were you
                        sensing a significant change in the demographics of Israeli population and
                        of politics; in other words as more and more people came out of the Soviet
                        Union the less sort of the old European Socialist side of things, the Labor
                        people were losing power in the Likud which is more Orthodox group was
                        gaining. Was that happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I would agree with most of that happening with the exception of the
                    impact of the Russians immigration. While Russian immigration was just beginning
                    to increase, it really increased much more after the collapse of the Soviet
                    Union.. With that said, the old European Socialist traditions, which were most
                    notable within the Labor Party from Ben-Gurion on, were fading. The Kibbutz
                    movement was less and less relevant, the Histadrut the Labor organization was
                    less relevant and increasingly large percentages of Israeli's were born in
                    Israel, had parents born in Israel and a diminishing percentage traced their
                    origins back to the Pale of Settlement in Eastern Europe. More Israelis had
                    origins from the Middle East and North Africa; they were Sephardim rather than
                    Ashkenazim and they had tougher impulses toward Arabs and Arab states. So some
                    of the traditions that Labor had led that gave it predominance for Israel's
                    first forty years were becoming increasingly less relevant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we see this as a plus or minus?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well it was a minus to the degree that we were encouraging a peace
                    process. The demographic changes made the environment more difficult for a peace
                    process. Otherwise it was mostly Israel's own business and we had to adjust as
                    well and deal with people who were not like those we knew before. If you think
                    of somebody like the former foreign minister for many years Abba Eban, he was no
                    longer a relevant figure. Even though he was in the Knesset, we had to focus on
                    these people who were born in Morocco, born in Iraq or sons and daughters of
                    people born there. We adjusted, we made contact and particularly the '80s, fewer
                    of them spoke English so it was important to have Hebrew. Actually, Tom
                    Pickering to his credit learned Hebrew in a year basically in an hour a day in
                    the morning drawing upon some old Arabic that he had learned while he was in
                    Jordan. I don't know anybody who in a year could learn enough Hebrew to function
                    and he did and was giving speeches after a year there. That was his mark of
                    incredible language aptitude.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the deputy political counselor and the counselor how
                        important or how heavy was the hand of the American Jewish community, AIPAC,
                        the Congressional lobby and all in your dealings or was this just part of
                        the underbrush?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: No, there are issues that it affects. One that it affected I would
                    argue was the embassy itself, which was in a renovated old hotel right on a main
                    street with a parking garage underneath us. We needed to improve security in
                    that embassy and at the point I was there, we had an option on a property that
                    was probably six or seven miles up the road in the direction of Herzliya that we
                    could have gotten and secured quite a large perimeter without a parking garage
                    underneath. It would have been our option to do with what we wished. Well at the
                    same time the Congress, in the lead up to U.S. elections, was in its regular
                    procedure of trying at least passing some resolution that the American Embassy
                    must move itself to Jerusalem, notwithstanding any potential impact on US
                    ability to promote a peace process. Even though the vast majority of Congress
                    people, in private, would not have thought this was a great idea at that moment
                    but they would pass the resolution to that effect. In any case, that year it was
                    done in the form of an appropriation restriction and the appropriation
                    legislation stated that the U.S. should not extend any funds to build an embassy
                    in Tel Aviv, but should instead spend any embassy construction funds in
                    Jerusalem.</p>
                <p>Well, Pickering because he was such a good negotiator and he had contacts and he
                    could be persuasive, wound up being instrumental in having the resolution
                    watered down so that it instead said, “The U.S. government should both direct
                    its efforts towards building an embassy in Jerusalem but could also improve a
                    temporary facility in Tel Aviv.” So in effect, we might have been able to go
                    ahead but then the Israelis, of course, had their own interests and the mayor of
                    Tel Aviv did not want us that far out of town and he intervened to block it.
                    Those were realities and we had to deal with them.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>It was true on a broader and more political front that Congress people visited
                    all the time and sometimes they came on Congressional funds and sometimes they
                    came sponsored by one of a number of usually American Jewish groups. As I
                    mentioned in one of our previous conversations, even some fundamentalist
                    Christian groups took an interest in settlement on the West Bank based on Jews'
                    biblical links to West Bank land and began to sponsor some conservative
                    Republican visits including those of Jesse Helms. With many of the, if I could
                    call them mainstream American Jewish groups, we had good relations with their
                    representatives in Israel and we would work together on congressional visits
                    that they were sponsoring; the embassy would be involved in congressional
                    meetings with official Israelis. These groups would take congressmen on other
                    portions of the visit themselves but it was reasonably amicable. There were
                    limitations on that; the embassy would not go into, for instance, the Golan
                    Heights with a Congressional delegation and we wouldn't travel with the Israeli
                    government into the West Bank and we would discourage Congress people from doing
                    it. But Congress members would often follow their own counsel. If there were
                    groups that were very interested in perpetuating Israeli control over the Golan
                    Heights and the West Bank these groups would encourage such visits strongly and
                    try to make sure it became a major feature of the visit. Some elements of the
                    Israeli government would be similarly inclined and push strongly for
                    congressional visitors to make the Golan and the West Bank major component of
                    the visit.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time, how did reporting come from Gaza and the
                        West Bank?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Historically, as you know, from your earlier interviews, there were
                    often fire fights between the consulate in Jerusalem and the embassy in Tel
                    Aviv. That was not the case in most of my time there; I think Maury Draper was
                    consul general for a while and then later Wat Cluverius. In both those cases,
                    there was an amicable relationship with the embassy so there wasn't the sniping
                    that there sometimes has been, at least not in public. We wouldn't send dueling
                    cables in with diametrically opposed views but we would have natural differences
                    because we had different interlocutors and different perspectives but we would
                    try to talk to each other and at least understand the other perspective before
                    what we put on paper. Fundamentally though in the 1980's reporting on the West
                    Bank was done by ConGen Jerusalem and that on Gaza by Embassy Tel Aviv.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything particular going on either in Gaza or
                        the West Bank? I mean the Intifada started then, didn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we view it at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well, it was I guess I would say that we viewed it with a lot of
                    concern. We raised questions about whether the response was disproportionate
                    because it was mostly stones against rubber bullets and eventually Washington
                    did take public positions but it usually ended in that famous phrase lamenting
                    the cycle of violence. We encouraged both sides to step back from actions which
                    only inflamed the cycle of violence. So U.S. government positions were
                    inconclusive at the end of the day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that in your reporting you had to be careful
                        of circumspect or something? So often the story has been over the decades
                        whatever is reported from the embassy usually ends up on a Congressman's
                        desk before it hits the appropriate desk in the State Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yes and I recall specifically with respect to the Intifada in one case,
                    an embassy report referred to repressive Israeli actions. That caused something
                    of a firestorm in certain circles of the Department of State where there was
                    angst that this word was used. So we were, in effect, told to be very careful on
                    how we dealt with the Intifada on paper.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way as a political reporting officer was it kind of
                        fun to be playing this somatic game in a so-called friendly state where your
                        controlled interest was really very circumscribed by political forces?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I don't know if I would call it fun; you are being facetious; it was a
                    bit frustrating. You see what you see and you know facts as you know them and it
                    was Rabin as defense minister who had control of this Israeli reaction. As I
                    said in my previous day's interview, I think he was basically an honorable man,
                    somebody who was tough and tough minded. His whole life had been shaped by
                    conflict but he wasn't someone who took pleasure in conflict or war. He felt
                    that if people were provoking you you needed to be tough with them or else they
                    would further provoke you. That said there were aspects of that reaction which
                    were oppressive and which were cruel. They did go overboard sometimes and U.S.
                    reaction to these excesses could help moderate the Israeli response. I think
                    from the American point of view to the degree we had universal concerns with
                    human rights and universal principals it was our role to make it clear to the
                    Israelis that excessive response was something that we disapproved of. I don't
                    think we were always clear at sending that message.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you left there when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: In the summer of 1988.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you left in your mind whither Israel?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: In order to be in our business and probably to be in the Middle East,
                    one has to try to retain elements of optimism. There was at that point a fellow
                    with whom Congressman Steve Solarz used to meet named Yehoshafat Harkabi, who
                    had previously been chief of Israeli military intelligence and later an
                    academic. Harkabi used to make an argument, which I think Rabin shared and Rabin
                    probably followed when he signed on a few years later to the Oslo Accords. It
                    was essentially that Israel and Palestinians had to come to an agreement, not
                    because they loved one another, not because it was in keeping with either
                    Israeli dreams or Palestinian dreams of what the future should be, but because
                    the only way that Israel could preserve itself as both a democratic state and a
                    Jewish state was by making an accommodation with the Palestinian inhabitants of
                    the region that involved giving up territory. So I think Rabin essentially
                    accepted that as well and I hoped it would be true as we've seen both before and
                    after the Oslo accords, the devil is in the implementation and even when you
                    have a broad-scale agreement I would say the implementation on both sides
                    subsequently caused all kinds of turmoil and problems that have bedeviled the
                    process subsequently.</p>
                <p>So I remained hopeful in an eventual peace agreement, but without taking
                    sufficient account of how difficult it would be; I certainly wasn't hopeful in
                    the short term because I had no belief that Likud or Shamir would make serious
                    compromises. Shamir later went on to become prime minister in his own right and
                    was there at the end of the Gulf War to resist mightily the efforts of Bush and
                    Baker to have an international peace conference. But basically they pushed him
                    very hard, he went along but eventually was defeated and Rabin was more
                    interested in a peace process when he became prime minister.</p>
                <p>That said Israel is a tough place and a tough place to do business. I like the
                    place, I like Israel, I like Israelis as tough as they are, but it's a difficult
                    place and I wound up going there ten years later that we will come to later in a
                    period where I was dealing with the Israel-Lebanon monitoring group.</p>
                <p>I should add that Israel was a very intense place to live and to work. Israelis
                    are very intense about almost everything and the pace of work was very intense
                    with us working long days almost every day with many official dinners and
                    receptions at night. So while it was a reasonably pleasant environment for my
                    family, I was not at home as much as I would have liked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '88. Then where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I went back to Washington. It was the point in my career that I should
                    be an office director and it was time to go back to Washington both for family
                    reasons as well as professional reasons. So looking at the options I wound up
                    taking and going back to Latin American issues and because office director for
                    Central American affairs in the summer of '88 and then moving up to become the
                    deputy assistant secretary in 1989.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well let's talk about Central American affairs. How stood
                        things at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well at that point it was the tail end of the Reagan Administration and
                    for the first several months of my time in Central American Affairs, the usual
                    uncertainty preceding American elections put most policy decisions on hold. By
                    that point, for all but a few diehards including the then Assistant Secretary
                    for Latin America Elliott Abrams, it was pretty much written in stone that there
                    would be no more Congressional military funding for the Contras. So this
                    controversial issue played itself out by trying to continue humanitarian
                    assistance to feed the contras, but not to provide further funding for military
                    activities.</p>
                <p>The last few months of that period were slow and not much really happening on
                    Central America. There was, let's see I can't recall now, I believe it was in
                    the fall of 1988 an effort by the Salvadoran guerrillas to mount a major effort
                    offensive did not succeed but had some implications for the future. Things got
                    more interesting with the election of Bush I and the designation of James Baker
                    as Secretary of State. They were both interested in, as Baker and Bush put it in
                    their memoirs, in putting the internal fighting in the U.S. over Central America
                    behind us. So they sought and succeeded with great difficulty in getting a
                    bipartisan accord with the Congress on Central America, particularly Nicaragua
                    in the spring of 1989. The new Assistant Secretary for Latin America, Bernie
                    Aronson, who as a Democrat in the Mondale administration had been at times
                    supportive of the Contras at least in the mid 1980s, was brought into the
                    Bush-Baker administration. But Bernie had ideas that it was also time to move on
                    from the policy that was so divisive in the U.S. and could not succeed in its
                    ultimate objective; it was not going to topple the Sandinistas per se. That made
                    it an interesting period and gave a lot of possibilities for movement.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>As I say, I moved up late 1989 to be the deputy assistant secretary when my
                    predecessor, Cris Arcos, went out as ambassador to Honduras. It was an
                    interesting period, very difficult in some ways because within the Congress
                    there were a lot of radically opposing positions on both the Left and the Right
                    with people like Senator Helms on the Right believing that military support
                    should never be ended for the Contras. Helms and his staff believed that the
                    Republican administration should continue pushing for that military funding and
                    the “Contras should not be betrayed” in their view. On the Left people like
                    Senator Chris Dodd, or at least his staff, believed that the US should
                    accommodate to the Sandinistas and, therefore, resisted the Administration's
                    efforts to sustain the Contras in camps until the Sandinistas agreed to a free
                    and fair election. That policy was the heart of the bipartisan agreement between
                    the Administration and the Democrats in Congress and I was involved in a lot of
                    Congressional consultations, a lot of travel to the region and diplomatic
                    contacts. The resulting election in Nicaragua in 1990 was lost by the
                    Sandinistas, much to their surprise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From your vantage point how did we feel that the election
                        would come out when they were getting ready...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: You've probably talked to a lot of other people on the subject but the
                    reality is the lower down the totem pole people were, the closer they were to
                    predicting the actual result in that election. The desk officer to Nicaragua at
                    that time was Craig Kelly, who went on to be an Ambassador and a deputy
                    assistant secretary in Western Hemisphere affairs, had the result almost exactly
                    on target for percentages of the vote that the United Opposition Movement would
                    get and that the Sandinistas would get. The higher up the chain you went the
                    more people were fearful, concerned, believing some of the polls that had come
                    out that the Sandinistas would win, not withstanding the fairer process that our
                    efforts had helped guarantee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get much of a chance to go down and talk to the
                        Sandinistas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I did one trip to Nicaragua soon after I returned to Washington and
                    then it became increasingly difficult, since they had expelled our Ambassador
                    and a number of embassy staff. We would see them in Washington more, and our
                    embassy was in contact with the Sandinistas. But yes, I had one trip down there
                    early on and then of course a number after the elections. We talked to the
                    Sandinistas and I don't think that the problem was really a lack of talking so
                    much as it was well there was a lot of bad history and fundamental lack of trust
                    on both sides. During my one, pre-election trip, the Sandinistas' efforts were
                    focused on getting the US to accommodate to their rule and my efforts were to
                    urge them to open up democratically and cease support for Salvadoran guerrillas.
                    Neither of us was likely to persuade the other.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking back on it was the overthrow by peaceful means of
                        the Sandinistas because of what they did or because of what we did
                        supporting the Contras and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I think the Sandinistas had alienated large portions of their public in
                    various ways, including through their autocratic rule and disastrous economic
                    policies. But it also true that the contra war had its negative economic
                    consequences and led the Sandinistas to institute a very unpopular military
                    draft to fight in that war. The Nicaraguan economic situation was declining for
                    several reasons, economic mismanagement as well as the fact that they were in a
                    war. So there were a lot of factors there, and certainly there is an argument to
                    be made that had the Contras not been supported, the Sandinistas might have been
                    able to maintain control, notwithstanding the negative economic and political
                    developments in their country.</p>
                <p>Once the elections in Nicaragua had taken place in February of 1990 and the
                    transition to the opposition government lead by President Chamorro took place
                    that spring, there were still many problems ahead in Nicaragua, including the
                    reluctance of Ortega and the Sandinistas to yield total power to her and their
                    willingness to use violence to hold on to shares of their power.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about El Salvador? How did you view things there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: El Salvador, I think we covered some of that the history the last time
                    we talked but there had been a substantial change by the time I came back to
                    Inter-American Affairs in 1988-'89. The guerrillas were stronger, but there was
                    also a stronger government with Freddie Cristiani, who was the Georgetown
                    University grad and a conservative politician. He was practical and anxious to
                    revive the country's economy and adopted good policies to revive the economy,
                    notwithstanding the war that was continuing. As the leader of the conservative
                    ARENA Party, he also had more political space to negotiate than had Christian
                    Democratic President Napoleon Duarte. The new US administration sent some
                    important signals. The FMLN guerrillas were also conscious of the fact that
                    there might be opportunities for negotiation, even with a Republican
                    administration. The FMLN did try their “final offensive” in November, 1989. When
                    the offensive failed the FMLN sent signals that they were open to a negotiation
                    process. I think they were also conscious, of course, particularly as we went
                    through 1989 of the changes within the Soviet Union and the fact that their
                    future support was less certain than it had been. In the course of that same
                    offensive, a Salvadoran military unit assassinated a number of prominent Jesuit
                    priests of Spanish origin. This unleashed a strong reaction in the US and
                    particularly the US Congress jeopardizing the future of US military assistance
                    to El Salvador. President Cristiani cooperated in the investigation of the
                    Jesuit assassinations and also made increasingly clear his openness to peace
                    negotiations led by the United Nations.</p>

                <p>In the Bush I Administration, both Secretary Baker and Bernie Aronson made clear
                    in several public statements and many private meetings that we were supportive
                    of a negotiation process which lead to a democratic outcome and inclusion of
                    people who may have been engaged in conflict in the past. This contrasted with
                    some hard-line views that the guerrillas must be defeated militarily. Baker and
                    Aronson were pragmatists, however, and recognized that congressional approval of
                    military assistance to El Salvador would not last forever and thus it was
                    important to support the peace process. So it was an uninteresting period
                    particularly after the Sandinistas lost the presidential election in February,
                    1990. That also helped, I think, convince the Salvadorian guerrillas that they
                    had no sure base of military support or place for training on the Central
                    American isthmus and therefore must show more flexibility in peace negotiations.
                    So our role on the military side was to continue military support and it was the
                    Department of Defense and the Southern command in particularly that improved the
                    Salvadorian army forces. On the political side the Department of State and I
                    were talking a lot to President Cristiani and his team, encouraging them in the
                    direction of negotiations. When the Salvadoran government asked the UN and to
                    head a negotiation effort; the Administration also began engaging intensively
                    with the United Nations and their negotiators over the peace process. I covered
                    my perspective on this in an “Orbis” article published in about 1993. We had a
                    good team in El Salvador, Bill Walker was ambassador and he actually began his
                    own discussions and visits to communities in the field where the FLN was
                    dominant to demonstrate that we were open to all sides.</p>
                <p>In the course of the long negotiating process, we had our disagreements with the
                    UN negotiators because we felt they were not pressing enough for a rapid end to
                    the military conflict. But we began monitoring those negotiations in the field
                    and in New York and eventually met with FMLN negotiators, as agreement neared in
                    1991. My perspective at the time and now, however, was that our most important
                    influence was on the Salvadoran government and armed forces and that we
                    maximized that ability to encourage productive negotiations by providing solid,
                    but conditioned support.</p>
                <p>We actually began a process of going down and meeting with the Salvadoran
                    negotiating team which had both civilian and military members to it and meeting
                    with them on almost a monthly basis. It was I think for them some degree of
                    confidence building that they should continue through with this process, that
                    the U.S. was not pushing them off a cliff. On the other hand at the same time
                    encouraging them to find a way of being flexible that would advance that
                    negotiating process. We did not have meetings with the other side, the guerrilla
                    side, the FMLN in that process until a good deal later in that process; probably
                    the summer of 1991 or the fall of 1991.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this because of prohibitions on our part or we
                        couldn't get a hold of them or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well I think it was mostly inhibitions on our own part that we were
                    reluctant, I think, to engage directly with them for fear that the Salvadorian
                    government would distrust our motives, be less willing to proceed on the
                    negotiating path and that it might negatively impact some Congressional
                    attitudes. There was for instance, one incident in about 1991 in which a US
                    helicopter crashed and several of the US crew were killed by FLMN guerrillas.
                    Congress reacted strongly, the administration reacted strongly; frankly we used
                    that in part as leverage on the FMLN to move more quickly in the negotiating
                    process but it also made it more difficult for us to have direct contacts in the
                    light of that incident. Though finally, as I said, in probably about the summer
                    of 1991 maybe even the spring of 1991, we began to have such contacts initially
                    at a fairly low level and gradually moving up the chain. I had my first contacts
                    with them in perhaps December of 1991; it was in the midst of a long negotiating
                    process that took place in the UN. Tom Pickering, then the US representative to
                    the UN, was extremely helpful in urging Secretary General Perez de Cuellar and
                    others to move the process forward. The Salvadorians happened to have an
                    excellent representative in the UN; he was working closely with Tom who had been
                    the ambassador to El Salvador in the 1980's. That negotiating process concluded
                    sometime after midnight on December 31, 1991 just as Perez de Cuellar was
                    finishing his term of office so he actually delayed his departure and prolonged
                    his stay in New York for several more hours until the negotiating process could
                    conclude. There was then a big ceremony recognizing the conclusion of at least
                    the framework of that negotiation in Mexico City in January 1992. A number of
                    details still remained to be worked out over the next six-eight months; but the
                    agreement did mark the effective end of combat and the turning of a page in El
                    Salvador. Overall I would say our role was a constructive role. I think in
                    retrospect it would have been advantageous for us to have contact with the FMLN
                    at a somewhat earlier state, not preempting the Salvadorian government but
                    keeping them informed. We might have understood the FMLN position better and
                    perhaps been able to play a more helpful role in nudging the two sides to an
                    agreement.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much was Jesse Helms and company a factor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: To a certain degree, but less so than on Nicaragua. Nicaragua had been
                    such a traumatic and divisive issue for so long, notwithstanding an official
                    bipartisan accord between the administration and Congress. In fact, on Nicaragua
                    and even after the Sandinista election defeat, dealing with Congress was a very,
                    very difficult process with views continuing to be polarized. As a matter of
                    fact, I was nominated to be ambassador to Nicaragua in I guess about April or
                    May of 1992; I never got a hearing. In my view, it was due to the political
                    polarization in the Congress on Nicaragua. This was one issue on which Dodd and
                    Helms staff could agree that I, as an individual responsible for the
                    Administration's Nicaragua policy, and a number of other people nominated at
                    that time should not be given hearings. Helms and Dodd staff had an argument
                    that the Administration and I had not briefed them properly and Senators Hems
                    and Dodd had the ability to prevent a hearing in the Senate Foreign Relations
                    Committee.. So in the end, I did not get confirmed, nor did other nominees to
                    Latin America..</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well we will come to that but by the time you got to
                        Central America was pretty well the threat to Brownsville, Texas, gone?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yes, that rhetoric had ended and it was only the politicians and policy
                    people who had been in the heart of the political fight who were still talking
                    about the 1980s issues. It was hard to have the same fear of leftists in Central
                    America at a time when the Soviet Union was coming to the end to the Soviet
                    subsidy to Cuba was having its effects upon Cuba's ability to project itself in
                    the region. When the Sandinistas lost the 1990 election, their reluctance to
                    hand over total power and their utilization of public demonstrations and
                    occasional violence to hang on to a share of power and to property were things
                    that should guide American policy with respect to Nicaragua. That was really
                    where the Jesse Helms shaped American policy, and in my view, not in a positive
                    direction. We wound up taking the position in legislation that if property had
                    been seized not just from an American citizen but from any Nicaraguan who later
                    became a U.S. citizen, then the US would suspend assistance to Nicaragua in like
                    amount. So the result was that the Chamorro government, a coalition of
                    democratic forces, were held responsible for what they could not deliver,
                    getting all land back that had been taken by Sandinistas and returned not only
                    to American citizens but to people who had been Nicaraguan citizens at the time
                    of the taking. That was done by Helms and other likeminded individuals in the
                    Congress; that sort of tied our hands and made that process a lot more
                    complicated for a number of years in Nicaragua.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might say the Helms crew I'm sure there were others too,
                        but I mean that Right-Wing hard-line group, from your perspective, could
                        they be dealt with or were they interested in reaching a good solution?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: We did deal with them, but as far as convincing them and having them be
                    cooperative it was very difficult and their perspective was shaped by history
                    and the absence of total victory over the Sandinistas. They suspected that the
                    Sandinistas were running things behind the scenes or that the opposition
                    government elected was being too soft on the Sandinistas or was not in full
                    control. Their view was that this centrist policy of the Bush administration had
                    failed and this was the dilemma that we were in certainly through 1992 while I
                    was there and for a number of years thereafter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You talk about the Right, what about the Left, sort of the
                        Sandalistas?Did they just fade away or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I think Sandalistas mostly faded away in terms of the Americans who had
                    gone down there and identified closely with the Sandinistas. With respect to the
                    Congress, there was some suspicion on the left of the Bush administration, even
                    though it was in my view pursuing a centrist policy of trying to push toward
                    election. There were some concerns that we were pressing too hard on those
                    issues. but once the election happened, Congressional Democrats were largely
                    supportive of providing the funding to the democratically elected government of
                    Nicaragua. The resistance and the limitations imposed on US assistance came
                    principally from conservative in Congress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then you say from that you were nominated to go to
                        Nicaragua as ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you realize that this was almost a non-starter?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: No, I don't think I would have said yes and I don't think my bosses
                    would have nominated me, had we known this. You know it really was a strange
                    alliance with Dodd and Helms staff in particular, combined to block my
                    nomination and that of Mike Kozak as ambassador to El Salvador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this just sort of a last gasp of the extreme Right in
                        our political thing vis-�-vis Central America?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Again, from my perspective, it was that they had one specific case that
                    both sides seized upon for their argument for not confirming me; that there had
                    been a particular program and whether it was properly notified to the correct
                    committees of Congress and whether it was in accord or not with the bipartisan
                    accord. Of course, it was not me specifically, it was rather the administration
                    as a whole but because Mike Kozak and I had been in deputy assistant secretary
                    positions at the time we were held responsible for what these congressional
                    staff argued had been insufficient notification of the Congress. The office of
                    the inspector general did a review at Secretary Baker's request to see whether
                    there was anything improperly done. They found that there was not anything
                    improper, but as things work in the nomination process, Senators in position to
                    block a process can do such. Helms at that stage would have been chairman of the
                    subcommittee on Western Hemisphere and Dodd the ranking minority so that was
                    sufficient for them to block a hearing from ever being held and so that wound up
                    not only frustrating toward nominations but actually all nominations made to the
                    Western Hemisphere from May of 1992 through the end of the Bush I
                    administration.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that we always use the term Helms and company
                        but often the staff of committee is important?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yes it is. I think on both sides the staff had decided that this was
                    what they wanted to do and convinced the senators to go along with it. The
                    senators rarely took action directly and I don't believe that they ever issued a
                    statement in their own name as to what was going on; they said it was staff
                    speaking for them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you left dangling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: About six months.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: That is a good question because I had agreed to give up my seat as
                    deputy assistant secretary at a time that I still expected to be confirmed and I
                    gave it up I believe, in June of '92, and John Maisto succeeded me. Then I went
                    down and sat in a little cubicle. Some portion of what I did was work
                    periodically on one or another initiative to try to revive the nominations. I
                    was able to meet with just about all other key Republican and Democratic
                    Senators and they indicated some support and interest in having the confirmation
                    hearing. But because the two senators, one Republican and one Democrat in the
                    key position, were in a position to block it I sat in a little cubicle. I did
                    choose to write sort of my history of the Salvador peace process which was
                    coming to a culmination in that period and was able to later get that published
                    in several places including in “Orbis” and in a Georgetown University
                    publication.</p>
                <p>Then finally about December 1992 I was asked one if I would like to go to Havana
                    the following year. I accepted and that position did not require Senate
                    confirmation. It was a chief of mission position but because it didn't have an
                    ambassadorial title it didn't have a Senate confirmation requirement. I was also
                    asked if I wanted to become a diplomat-in-residence at Georgetown for the
                    January through June period. I think Brandon Grove had been there and then he
                    went out and did something related to Somalia so he was out of Georgetown. I
                    went there and worked the usual diplomat-in-residence role presenting some
                    papers and speaking in classes and doing some writing, where I actually put
                    together a book for Georgetown on embassies in crisis that semester. The
                    frustrating period was the five-six months that I was sitting in a closet.</p>

                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I was not somebody who could continue dwelling on the negative, always
                    looking for something more positive and certainly Georgetown was more positive.
                    I enjoyed that experience. I also had more time to myself than I had in a long
                    time and began preparing for a triathlon and actually completed several
                    triathlons in the spring of 1993 before leaving for Havana.</p>
                <p>To go back and pick out one piece that occurred in 1990 while I was DAS for
                    Central America. There was an episode in Trinidad in the Caribbean that had a
                    very brief life, but was a big deal at the time. In late July of 1990 a radical
                    local group, Jamaat al Muslimeen, which had been trained in Libya, seized the
                    parliament building in Port of Spain, Trinidad and killed several people
                    including an MP and wounded other MPs and held the prime minister and several
                    other people captive. Well we had an arrangement within the State Department
                    regional bureaus at the time, where when a major crisis like this happened, the
                    US would be able to dispatch a multi-agency team under the leadership of the
                    State Department to help in whatever way we could. Well in ARA, we had decided
                    that the DAS who had responsibility for the region Sally Cowal should stay in
                    Washington with the task force and another DAS from ARA should go down as leader
                    of the team and that's what I did. I wound up going down with a fairly large
                    team from a number of different agencies. We wound up arriving late at night
                    with scores of people and lots of equipment and it was complicated for several
                    reasons. One, of course, was that the prime minister was being held and there
                    was no clear authority within the government. It was also complicated because
                    the U.S. ambassador at the time, a political appointee, was off island without
                    authorization. So I remember being in Larry Eagleburger's, then deputy secretary
                    of State's, office on a Saturday morning and him trying to be reached by this
                    wandering ambassador. Eagleburger said I don't want to talk to him; I don't want
                    him to go back I just want him to go away. This fellow, of course, being wealthy
                    and connected presumably at the White House found his way back in eventually
                    after we and our team had arrived. He showed up and was, I would say, very meek
                    and asked me: “You know, if you have a moment some time I would really
                    appreciate a briefing on what's going on.” We did that and this Ambassador
                    survived in the position, which shows you that political appointees can survive
                    big mistakes much easier than career appointees.</p>
                <p>This fellow eventually became ambassador to Italy in the Bush II administration
                    so it didn't hurt him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: But in any case, our team down there we did our duty. The most
                    important part of what we did was help the Trinidadian government overcome their
                    own internal disorganization and cut off the communication that the radical
                    group in the parliament had with the outside world. We also advised the Trinidad
                    government on how to pressure them more effectively to negotiate. An agreement
                    was eventually reached and all were released with no further harm. The group
                    members were promised that they would not be prosecuted, but they were indeed
                    prosecuted, since that commitment had been made under duress. But then within
                    the Privy Council System there was an eventual appeal and they were released
                    some years later.</p>
                <p>On our last day in Trinidad, there was concern that word of the US mission to
                    Trinidad was beginning to surface in wire service stories. But then on our
                    flight home, we got word that Saddam Hussein had just invaded Kuwait, thereby
                    ending any interest in our little adventure.</p>
                <p>Overall, we had played a useful role and adapted our role to what could be most
                    helpful in the circumstances. One of the lessons the U.S. learned from that
                    experience was that any such team in the future should be much smaller and
                    adapted to the needs. So there was a practical lesson learned as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did the team do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: What we did was provide advice for them, encourage them to cut off the
                    communications of the kidnapers to the outside which they were using to put
                    pressure on the families of the parliamentarians to surrender to their every
                    demand. We also helped the government get better information because the police
                    branch that had the information reported directly to the prime minister and,
                    therefore, was keeping the information to themselves. Then we just counseled
                    them in negotiations in ways that wound up being useful to them so that the
                    government made better decisions and was able to end the standoff without
                    further bloodshed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the reaction of the authorities there? We didn't
                        have the greatest relations with them did we?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: By then relations had begun to improve, because Eric Williams whose
                    name you probably remember and was a long-term and perplexing leader with whom
                    the U.S. did have a complicated relationship, had departed the scene several
                    years earlier. So our relationship was better. The island is fairly evenly
                    divided between the mostly Black supported party and another Indian supported
                    party, but the US had decent relations with the two and we have very good
                    economic relationships because of shared petroleum interests. But I would guess
                    at the end of the day, it wasn't my watch so once I got home I didn't follow it
                    closely. It appears that probably played a positive role that we could be
                    trusted to act prudently, advise quietly and not take public credit and so on in
                    ways that I have to imagine were useful and, I think, our good relationship
                    continues today</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well we will pick this up the next time. We are talking
                        about what '93?You went to Havana...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Right in '93, the summer of '93.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay why don't we stop here and pick it up in '93 when you
                        are off to Havana.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Today is the 16th of November 2010 with Joe Sullivan. We are going to move to
                    when you were off to Cuba. You were in Cuba from when to when?</p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: From July 1993 until, I believe, July 1996.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, how political was this appointment, particularly
                        the Miami Cubans and all this. Are you familiar or were you involved in sort
                        of the maneuverings before you went out there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well I had not had direct responsibility for Cuba. My then boss, the
                    Assistant Secretary Bernie Aronson, had been dealing with the Cuban-American
                    community on a number of issues and had basically a good relationship with them
                    so I imagine he would have told them that I was a good guy, I trust him and so
                    on. But, I never felt any resistance from the Cuban-American community prior to
                    my departure. As I said, that was an appointment that, even though I had the
                    title of chief of mission, because it didn't have the title of ambassador, it
                    did not require Senate confirmation. So I didn't have to jump through the hoops
                    that might have been more complicated with some members of Congress extremely
                    close to the Cuban-American community. That said remind me of this point a
                    couple of times as we go through on Cuba in case I've forgotten anything on the
                    impact of the Cuban-American community. I, for instance, chose deliberately on
                    my way into Havana to stop in Miami; that was almost obligatory in order to
                    catch the charter flights to Havana at that point in any case. I visited with
                    several different elements of the Cuban-American community. I chose to do that
                    at the beginning so that I could be in a listening mode, I could hear them and
                    yet I would not need to respond to them. I eventually decided that I wasn't
                    going to make such meetings a regular occurrence on my trips back and forth. I
                    wasn't going to be reporting to them, I was going to be hearing their views
                    early on but then leaving the subsequent interaction to Washington and there was
                    certainly plenty of that particularly, between the Cuba desk in the State
                    Department and the Cuban-American community.</p>
                <p>I guess one of those early encounters that was memorable in that the
                    Cuban-American National Foundation, CANF, as it was called was run at that time
                    by Jorge Mas Canosa, since deceased. But he was very hard-line and very
                    assertive. He himself was not present, he was reportedly traveling but I was
                    left with several members of the board. I would say that they basically sought
                    to give me my marching orders, whom I should meet with, whom I should not meet
                    with, which members of the opposition community they trusted and, therefore,
                    that I should meet with, which ones they did not trust and, therefore, I should
                    not meet with. Indeed, as it turned out several of the people that were on their
                    trusted list proved to be double agents in effect reporting to Cuban state
                    security. That said it was a listening exercise and sort of confirmed my view
                    that I simply didn't want to be in regular contact with that community otherwise
                    I would be in a position of being asked how I had obeyed their instructions.</p>
                <p>In Cuba at the time I arrived it was a very interesting time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before I leave that subject did you get the equivalent to
                        informants within the Miami Cuban population? Were there various schools,
                        factions or was the Mas pretty much the dominant?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well there were others. There was one group of I guess you would call
                    them supporters of the Democratic Party, the Clinton administration was in
                    office at the time, there were Cuban-Americans that had been working with the
                    Clinton campaign. And the Clinton Administration was very focused on the
                    electoral importance of Florida and the hope of eroding some of the traditional
                    85% Cuban-American support for Republican Party candidates. I met with the
                    Cuban-American Democrats as well; they were more moderate obviously, more
                    cognizant of the fact that the administration was looking for ways to not
                    necessarily be confrontational in every instance but to advance US interests on
                    Cuba. Not at that time but I guess later my conclusion was that even most of
                    that community when it really came down to it, at least through the nineties,
                    wound up being out shouted by the hard-line community. When push came to shove,
                    moderate Cuban-Americans were not willing to stand-up and argue for moderate
                    positions, so the dominant voice clearly was that of CANF and other hard-line
                    elements within the community. This affected Radio Marti and other instruments
                    of US policy at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, so what did you arrive to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well I think probably to the low point in terms of the Cuban economic
                    situation and to some elements of political crisis as well. The Soviet Union had
                    obviously collapsed, the subsidy of about $5 billion a year had essentially come
                    to an end. There was an enormous and a drastic economic crisis that affected
                    every Cuban. There was a tremendous shortage of gasoline, of petroleum. The
                    public transport that there used to be was virtually non-existent. Instead the
                    people were to the degree they had to make long distance trips were riding in
                    the backs of trucks, hundreds at a time, because there was no other means of
                    transportation. The state was coping very poorly with all of this. At the
                    beginning of that period I recall that summer of '93 there were large scale
                    blackouts throughout the city due to lack of fuel to run power plants. Water was
                    also a problem. The Cuban government had allowed the water supply system to
                    deteriorate mightily over the years and had compensated by delivering water by
                    tanker trucks through the poor neighborhoods. Now they had a fuel crisis which
                    made water delivery trucks increasingly problematic to keep going. There were
                    also some small indications of unrest bubbling up, crowds assembling in front of
                    neighborhood Communist Party offices and throwing rocks through windows under
                    cover of the blackout's darkness, things that were very unusual in Cuba, since
                    the bulk of the population had long since been intimidated; this was not
                    usual.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>That economic crisis continued and I did travel throughout the country even
                    fairly early on. I think within two or three months of my arrival I made a trip
                    out to the northeastern province of Holguin and had to deal with that shortage
                    of gasoline, for instance. We had to go to the local provincial party office in
                    order to get them to open the gas tank so that we could buy some gasoline in
                    order to proceed with our trip. I saw many manifestations of this crisis and
                    outside Havana, it was even worse. There were not just frequent blackouts, but
                    virtually permanent blackouts in many of the regional cities. So there was great
                    unrest, there was a lot of uncertainty and I think the government and the
                    Communist Party at the time, including Fidel himself, appeared to be off balance
                    and not really certain of which way to go. There had been some small steps taken
                    earlier to no longer penalize people for having foreign currency and this was
                    helpful over time because it encouraged Cuban-Americans to send more remittances
                    to their family members. Previously, some remittances had been delivered
                    furtively to family members, but those family members had been required under
                    law to convert them into virtually worthless Cuban pesos. But once holding
                    dollars was legalized and the U.S. also took steps to permit the legal transfer
                    of limited remittances to family members, remittances increased greatly. The
                    Cuban government also began setting up dollar stores in order to absorb these
                    dollars and importing the coca cola, shampoo and other goods from Panama and
                    Mexico and then selling them to the public at a profit so that the Cuban
                    government got some indirect foreign exchange benefit from remittances sent to
                    relatives in Cuba. But it did take a while and that whole year, I would say, was
                    a year of crisis.</p>
                <p>There was a great shortage of food; there were a lot of Cubans who were eating
                    nothing but rice, not even beans were available. Others were eating very little,
                    there were some indications of malnutrition. We actually began approving
                    assistance of medical supplies to Caritas, which is the Catholic Relief
                    Organization in Cuba. We used to have pretty good relations with both that
                    organization and the Catholic Church as a whole and they worked out a means of
                    verifying that the medical donations from the US were used properly and not
                    diverted by the Cuban government. The Cuban government dominated the health
                    system and all hospitals, but through a network of Catholic doctors, Caritas was
                    able to monitor that these were not being siphoned off into the system but
                    rather used appropriately for people who needed the medical supplies.</p>
                <p>When I arrived, the Cuban government showed more than usual interest in engaging
                    with me. The Interests Section had traditionally been confined to mid-level
                    contacts in the Foreign Ministry, but soon after I arrived, I was received by
                    the Foreign Minister. But the sticking point became, and I certainly had enough
                    meetings in Washington to have a clear picture of Clinton Administration policy
                    on Cuba. In the past, at various points the U.S. had signaled that Cuba
                    abstaining from promotion of international guerrilla movements and ending
                    military cooperation with the Soviet Union would be good enough to establish a
                    much better relationship with the United States. Our position by 1993 was that
                    we also would require changes within Cuba itself. That was a condition the Cuban
                    government was absolutely and totally unwilling to yield on so the degree of our
                    contacts diminished.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>The US Interests Section benefited from diminished state controls, which were
                    declining for lots of reasons, including fewer funds to enforce them. In
                    addition, the famous Committees for the Defense of the Revolution in many cases
                    became virtually inactive; the neighborhood watch committees became inactive.
                    The heads of the neighborhood watch committees were involved in the same small
                    scale corruption as the rest of their neighbors in order to be able to feed
                    their families and were thus not in position to “snitch” on their neighbors. So
                    many of the regime's traditional controls were breaking down and we were able to
                    take advantage of these openings to be in touch with more people. There were
                    more opposition elements beginning to take chances to move around and we met
                    with them. We did a number of things to try to provide them with materials;
                    mostly open materials, press articles and this sort of thing. The Cuban
                    government didn't much like that. I recall being called into the foreign
                    ministry and told that our activity was noted and was not welcome. We had even
                    met with some of these elements and that was not welcome. So there were
                    significant tensions and the tension grew. I would say the Cuban government was
                    uneasy about its own what they saw as slippage in its own control.</p>
                <p>The Cuban government paralysis I would say for the most part continued right up
                    through the summer of '94 when tens of thousands of Cubans escaped the island on
                    rafts and small craft. We could travel to beaches just outside Havana and watch
                    people saying goodbye to their families as they climbed on board a raft;
                    international media coverage made this a public spectacle and an embarrassment
                    for the regime. The Cuban government did not encourage the phenomenon, at first,
                    but did not devote the same resources that they had in the past to preventing
                    unauthorized departure from Cuba. The U.S role in this phenomenon was ambiguous.
                    The US government did not wish to see mass migration from Cuba of the sort that
                    occurred at the time of Mariel in 1980, but much of the Cuban-American community
                    was cheering on the exodus and USG-funded Radio Marti was covering the exodus
                    enthusiastically. Both the Cuban-American community and the U.S. government
                    hoped that the growing crisis might lead to some change in Cuba. One
                    Cuban-American group, Brothers to the Rescue, flew small planes to find rafters
                    at sea and the US Coast Guard stood some six miles offshore to pick up these
                    people on rafts and bring them to the safety of the US Naval Base at
                    Guantanamo.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>At this point, in the summer of 1994, the most spectacular event of public
                    protest took place, commonly referred to as the “Maleconazo”, the Malecon being
                    the waterfront in front of Havana. In the midst of this wave of rafters, one day
                    for unknown reasons, a rumor had spread throughout Havana that there were going
                    to be ships or a fleet of small vessels similar to the Mariel boat lift that
                    would evacuate anybody who wished to leave. Based on that unfounded rumor,
                    probably as many as 10 thousand Cubans gathered in the Havana waterfront waiting
                    for their opportunity to get out. Well no such boatlift occurred and the police
                    were unable to control the crowd. As late afternoon settled in and it appeared
                    that no fleet was coming, the crowd turned to rock throwing, throwing rocks
                    through the dollar store and helping themselves to things out of the dollar
                    stores that many would not have had the dollars to purchase otherwise. There was
                    a famous incident in which Fidel came down in a jeep and confronted the
                    protesters and the Cuban version of that is, of course, that his heroic action
                    turned back the crowd and everybody agreed to go back to being a revolutionary
                    once again. Other versions are that there were numerous layers of protection
                    behind him and readiness to assert force as necessary in order to deal with the
                    crowd; I believe the latter.</p>
                <p>From that moment on, Fidel and the Cuban Communist Party and government decided
                    to reassert themselves to retake control of the streets. They had for the past
                    year basically left the streets empty and those streets had gradually found
                    space for opposition and even mobs as had occurred in the “Maleconazo”. That
                    very weekend, the Cuban government called one of its massive demonstrations with
                    everybody from their work place told that they must attend and sought to retake
                    the streets and reassert its security presence. While this increased
                    assertiveness did not end the reasons for Cuba's economic and political crisis,
                    they did once again mobilize Cuba's instruments of state security, which are the
                    critical means of maintaining state control.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>There was another decision that plays into the current Cuban developments with
                    Raul now in charge. I don't have total documentation of this but I think it's
                    highly probable. There was, as I said, a growing food shortage. I met several
                    Cuban economists who favored increasing incentives for production. These
                    economists appeared to be being encouraged by Defense Minister Raul Castro and
                    the Armed Forces. Cuba had experimented once before with agricultural markets in
                    the early 1980's as a way to address food shortages. But at that point, the only
                    ones who had been allowed to participate in these agricultural markets were the
                    tiny percentage of private farmers in Cuba. The official perception of that 1980
                    experience was that these markets helped address the food shortages, but also
                    made that small group of private farmers wealthy and so the experiment was ended
                    after several years. The process that was eventually approved in 1994 was to
                    allow even the agricultural collectives and the cooperatives to participate in
                    the farmers' markets. Once they had satisfied the quota that they owed to the
                    state, they were allowed to sell off any excess food production in these
                    agricultural markets. And the sales were to be in dollars or a newly created
                    convertible peso, which many Cubans did not have, but those receiving
                    remittances from relatives abroad or with access to tourist dollars did. The
                    collectives or cooperatives could use these more valuable proceeds to meet other
                    needs of the collective farm. So this was an effective policy in the sense that
                    it encouraged collectives and cooperatives to meet their quota to the state,
                    which many of them previously not done. Because products were only sold
                    initially dollars and then later in a newly introduced convertible Cuban peso
                    set at one dollar to a convertible peso, these markets helped soak up the dollar
                    remittances that were coming into the country. The part that I believe took
                    place, but I don't have confirmation from anybody who was a participant is that
                    Raul and a number of generals met with Fidel and they basically told him,
                    “Commandante in Jefe, we support you and will always support you, etc., but it
                    would be easier if we gave the people some food to eat. So let us try this
                    experiment and see if it works.” Fidel did allow that to happen and I would say
                    it was a largely successful experiment that continues to this day. It gave
                    greater incentives for food production and gave those Cubans who had access to
                    foreign exchange a way to obtain food. Some of them undoubtedly shared with
                    their relatives who didn't have such access. It helped to diminish the shortages
                    and probably encouraged some additional production. So that policy reform as
                    well as the reassertion of political control helped the regime began to regain
                    its footing and recover from the acute crisis which had marked the early
                    1990's.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right here.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Okay, I guess the only other thing I would add to that is in that
                    period as well there was some liberalization toward very small private
                    enterprise activities, small half steps by allowing people to open small
                    restaurants or “paladares” in their homes, to rent out rooms in their houses, to
                    work independently in small occupations like “button sewer” or driving bicycle
                    pedicabs to take tourists around. I recall actually being quite wrong on this
                    issue as I thought, “Wow this is an interesting opening and once people get a
                    little bit more economic independence, they won't be as dependent on the state
                    and it will be increasingly difficult for the state to maintain control of the
                    population. Our political officer Bob Witajewski was more cynical and more
                    correct. He said, “Watch, they'll start cutting this back over time and
                    regaining control of it,” and indeed the regime did. They both began taxing the
                    relatively small private income quite heavily and imposing increasingly
                    bureaucratic restrictions, diminishing greatly both the effect of those small
                    changes as well as any sense of independence by the people who were beginning to
                    earn some money of their own. Whenever the Cuban regime has had to choose
                    between maintaining its political control and improving the economy through
                    liberalization, the regime has come down in favor of maintaining its political
                    control.</p>
                <p>Okay, you tell me how you would like me to proceed. Would you like me to just
                    keep on talking on this or...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah, let's talk a little about the embassy, the staff
                        there. How did you find the Mission?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Right, right. I think everybody who went to Cuba in that period had the
                    hope that they would be there at the time when Cuba would begin to change
                    dramatically. We were in the old embassy building right on the Malecon. We were
                    only occupying, I believe, three out of the six stories as we had a fairly small
                    operation. That changed dramatically in 1994 and I will come to that, but
                    initially we were pretty small. It was in the initial period that we got
                    permission from the Cuban government to renovate that embassy building and that
                    actually took a lot of effort and planning and logistical preparation in the
                    isolated environment that was Cuba. Even though the Cuban government had
                    initially promised us that they would not interfere in the project, they
                    inevitably did interfere and caused all kinds of complications in completing the
                    renovation. We used to say that whenever bilateral relations went into a crisis,
                    Fidel would assume the role of desk officer for the US and even small decisions
                    on bringing in building supplies or shipping out empty freight containers would
                    get subsumed into the political crisis.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>But our staff was good and enthusiastic, even though with the exception of the
                    ambassador's residence, we were totally dependent on the Cuban government as to
                    which other properties we could use as our residences. Over time, we gradually
                    improved the quality of the residences for our staff, although they were still
                    less than what we have in the US or in other countries. There was undoubtedly a
                    lot of monitoring of our activities, somewhat constrained by the economic crisis
                    early on, but increasing as time went on. Morale was pretty good, it's a
                    beautiful country, it's a beautiful city. Cubans themselves are interesting
                    people and were much more open to talking to Americans than they had been in the
                    past. They didn't fear the state as much as they used to. They, themselves, in
                    many cases had resumed relations with their relatives who had gone to the U.S.;
                    some of those relationships had been virtually broken off with what the state
                    called “worms” who had left Cuba. But now the Cuban people were very anxious to
                    resume relations with Americans, both because they hoped for some degree of
                    economic support but also because they saw the world changing and the world that
                    they had been told would be a Socialist international conquest was not going to
                    take place. And for our own staff, their ability to have friendly relations with
                    Cubans increased greatly. I personally and a number of our staff used to bike
                    all over the area and have contact with many Cubans in the process. These were
                    not political contacts, but did give me a good feel for how Cubans lived. In
                    addition, as Cuba sought to make itself more attractive to tourism, this
                    increased the recreational opportunities for our staff. There were downsides, of
                    course. Housing was mostly mediocre; food shopping in dollars was initially
                    limited to the state's “diplomercado;” and communication outside the island was
                    difficult. So it was an interesting period. Over time, there were some openings,
                    but some closing in as well.</p>
                <p>In 1994, as a result of that rafter crisis, Fidel, almost simultaneous with his
                    getting his feet back under him on the economy, also decided to call the U.S. on
                    the contradictions of its own policy. U.S. policy on the one hand was we didn't
                    want another Mariel mass migration that would cause problems for the U.S.
                    internally. On the other hand, the US Coast Guard was going to rescue every
                    rafter who made it out to the six-mile limit, often pointed to the rafters by
                    Cuban-American pilots from the “Brothers to the Rescue” organization. In
                    addition, US-sponsored Radio Marti broadcasts became increasingly provocative in
                    encouraging Cubans to take to the seas. So Fidel gave one of his patented three
                    or four hour interviews on television in which he said that Cubans were no
                    longer going to take any efforts to prevent people from leaving.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>The Friday night the Cubans decided to force the issue by ceasing to enforce
                    control of their borders, I was personally faced with this ambivalence in Cuban
                    policy. We had heard of the Cuban intention to stop enforcing their border
                    controls and the State Department desk, reflecting US concern at the prospect of
                    Cuban mass migration, asked that I express concern to the Cuban Government. I
                    called our designated Foreign Ministry interlocutor and expressed concern that
                    the Cuban Government measure could encourage people to put their lives at risk.
                    Later that night, in his three-hour interview on state television, Fidel
                    referred to the call from SULLIVAN, said with the full Spanish pronunciation and
                    claimed incorrectly that I had threatened Cuba. That was only one of dozens of
                    arguments Fidel made to justify the change in Cuban policy. It is never
                    comfortable to be called out on national television and I did decide to call off
                    my planned bike ride in the morning, but I never did feel any public reaction to
                    me or the US during my time in Cuba. Even the previously common ritualistic
                    marches of protest at the US Interests Section had been put on hold. And on
                    Saturday evening, I attended, as planned, the national day reception at the
                    Bolivian Embassy. My diplomatic colleagues were friendly, as usual. But I
                    remember best a well-known Foreign Ministry official approaching me and saying,
                    “Nothing personal, just business.” My “Godfather” moment.</p>
                <p>Once Cuba stopped efforts to prevent illegal migration, the numbers opened up and
                    there were many thousands of additional Cubans who took to the sea on rafts. The
                    U.S. picked them up until we wound up with 30 thousand of them. We adopted an
                    interim policy of taking them to Guantanamo and housing them in Guantanamo. But
                    as the number grew over 30 thousand this was an increasingly untenable policy as
                    well. The U.S. negotiated privately with the Cuban government, Peter Tarnoff,
                    the undersecretary for political affairs, was the US negotiator and Ricardo
                    Alarcon the Cuban negotiator and they agreed on a new migration accord with the
                    Cuban government under which the Cuban government would once again begin to
                    control its borders and the U.S. would be entitled to return Cubans to Cuba that
                    we had interviewed and decided were fleeing for economic reasons rather than
                    having a well founded fear of persecution. As well, we would grant 20 thousand
                    Cubans per year entry into the U.S. above and beyond any number that were
                    admitted as refugees. There had been a mutual misunderstanding of an earlier
                    1970's migration agreement with Cuba in which the U.S. had agreed to take up to
                    20 thousand a year. We interpreted the agreement to read that we would take up
                    to 20 thousand, if that number qualified, whereas the Cubans interpreted that as
                    a US obligation to take the full 20 thousand each year. So, in effect, we
                    adopted the Cuban interpretation of that agreement in order to discourage
                    continued mass migration.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>The new bilateral migration agreement resulted in the need for us increasing our
                    consular staff greatly, tripling approximately the size of our consular section
                    and adding as well I think six INS officers in order to both give expedited
                    refugee hearings for refugee applicants, but also eventually to grant additional
                    numbers of people entry through humanitarian parole procedures so that we could
                    meet the 20,000 entry quota compared to the 3,000 or so Cubans being admitted
                    annually in immediately previous years. So the Interests Section became a much
                    larger operation and processed over 25,000 Cuban entries per year. One new and
                    important part of our duties became receiving the Cuban migrants who were
                    returned by the Coast Guard to the port of Mariel and then taking their contacts
                    in order to go visit them across the island to make sure they were not being
                    persecuted for reasons of their having departed the island, as was specified in
                    our new migration accord. That opened a whole new set of activities for us and
                    allowed us a window on much of Cuba that we had not previously had, including
                    into what Cuban life was like even in the most remote villages and most remote
                    provinces. I remember back then in 1995, we actually began using GPS in order to
                    find the location of these remote places where people came from and be able to
                    go back there several months later and visit them again. Those returnees did not
                    find it easy to get employment, but then that had already been difficult before
                    their flight.</p>

                <p>SULLIVAN: While the US had made no commitments on what to do with the 30,000
                    Cubans housed at Guantanamo, the US came under a lot of pressure particularly
                    from the Cuban-American community in Miami and wound up taking almost all of
                    those 30 thousand directly into the U.S. In order to issue 20 thousand entry
                    visas at the Interests Section, we actually began having a lottery in order to
                    reach the quota, because there weren't enough family qualified members or
                    political refugees to come close to the agreed number of 20 thousand. So we
                    began having a lottery with over 100,000 entrants dropping their applications in
                    a lottery box at the Interests Section. The individuals who won that lottery had
                    to demonstrate that they wouldn't become a public charge and weren't otherwise
                    disqualified in order to get an immigrant visas to go to the United States. Most
                    of them could find a relative somewhere in the US who would promise to support
                    them so they would not become a public charge. This huge and publicly visible
                    popularity of emigrating from Cuba was embarrassing to the Cuban regime, but
                    they tolerated it for the most part. We began taking in about 25 thousand Cubans
                    every year so it really changed the dynamics substantially and probably from the
                    Cuban government perspective it helped. They had always regarded migration and
                    even the refugee process as escape valves to take some of the most discontented
                    off their hands.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you and your staff have any sort of campaign of
                        tweaking the Cuban authorities or would this have been counter
                        productive?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well, tweaking them mostly took place out of Washington, and note there
                    were plenty of strong statements out of Washington. It also took place in the
                    form of our maintaining contact with those the Cuban government regarded as
                    dissidents and we regarded as human rights activists or opposition. We reached
                    out in various ways through public diplomacy and information, cultivating
                    contacts with a wide range of groups. There were very few non-state
                    institutions, but to the degree we could find them we went looking for them and
                    we cultivated contacts for instance with associations of scientists, even the
                    old Masons who were mostly in their eighties; establishing contacts like that.
                    We also did promote a certain degree of contact with let's say encouraging for
                    instance as I recall a cultural contact between the city of New Orleans and the
                    city authorities of Havana because there had been a shared history. There were
                    common interests in that history, those documents and, therefore, we facilitated
                    that contact. Now we thought this was positive both because it opened channels
                    of communication between non-official Cubans and Americans and allowed people to
                    talk to one another. I'd say the Cuban government was probably ambivalent about
                    such contacts, and those with their principal responsibility for security were
                    downright suspicious of contacts they did not control. Frequently as we would
                    set up those activities we would get mixed signals and sometimes would even have
                    the activity blocked by the Cuban government.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>One other thing on public diplomacy, immediately after the bilateral migration
                    accord, reflected interesting light on perspectives from the two sides. The
                    Cuban government after the migration accord had some hope, that this would open
                    new avenues of contact and new prospects for improved relations with the Clinton
                    administration. My public affairs officer, a very good officer named Gene
                    Bigler, was in touch with their television authorities. They agreed to a
                    television interview of me that would be broadcast on Cuban television. Now I
                    don't think I or any of my staff had ever appeared on Cuban television or radio
                    but Gene negotiated well that they would agree to broadcast the interview in its
                    entirety, no splicing and dicing and so on. I don't claim credit for a great
                    interview, but one careful and precise statement that I made in that interview,
                    when asked the predictable question about would this migration accord lead to
                    other improvements in relations between the United States and Cuba. My response
                    was that the United States was indeed interested in improving relations with the
                    Cuban people and we would seek every way to have a better relationship between
                    the American and Cuban people. That interview was broadcast and apparently it
                    provoked the ire of Fidel or others in high places and some people in Cuban
                    television got in trouble. Fidel was in the enviable position of not having to
                    take any responsibility for decisions, but if in the end, he did not like the
                    outcome, someone else would suffer the consequences. Needless, to say, we were
                    not given any other opportunities for on-air interviews. On the other hand, the
                    BBC correspondent in Cuba reported that I had said that the U.S. government was
                    seeking improved relations with the Cuban government and would be anxious to
                    have increased agreements and contacts with the Cuban government. The BBC report
                    is what made it back to the US through the wire services. At the State
                    Department Nick Burns, the Department spokesman and a good friend, was going to
                    have to answer the question about what is it that the chief of the interests
                    section said in Havana about improving relations with the Cuban government. Nick
                    called me; I told him precisely what I had said and Nick had no problem in
                    answering that question from the podium. But this does show the two different
                    sides and the political sensitivities on the two sides of the Florida
                    straits.</p>
                <p>I should also relate an effort by the Clinton Administration in the fall of 1995
                    to create an opening with Cuba. The initiative unfortunately reflected the
                    policy ambiguities of Clinton Administration Cuba policy. In the U.S. and
                    especially in Miami, the initiative was presented as a means to open up Cuba and
                    loosen Castro regime authority. While in Havana, I was instructed to explain to
                    my interlocutor Ricardo Alarcon that this new initiative could result in
                    gradually improving relations between the US and Cuban governments, provided
                    that Cuba liberalized internally. Well the Cuban government had, by then
                    concluded that it had no interest in liberalizing its control and was more
                    likely to believe that our intentions were what we said in Miami; i.e. to
                    undermine the regime. I remember vividly Alarcon's reaction, which was to say
                    that they were not fools and recognized that the US was seeking to create
                    vulnerabilities in the regime and that Cuba saw no benefit in the offered
                    opening and thus was not interested. The lesson I drew from that is that we
                    should not make something we determine to be in the US interest dependent on
                    Cuban government action, since their interests are rarely the same.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much at this time did you feel that Castro was calling
                        all the shots?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I would say particularly once he reasserted himself he was calling most
                    of the shots and with respect to the United States whenever things reached a
                    crisis stage or anything that was a major issue he rapidly became the desk
                    officer for the United States. That exemplified itself in certainly the
                    migration crisis, the rafter crisis, his deciding to take, in effect, to provoke
                    the United States on this and call us on the contradictions on our policy. It
                    also, I think, you could see it even in little things like the refurbishment of
                    our embassy whereas previously it had been handled at relatively low levels and
                    they probably did get high level sign offs on it when they gave us assurances
                    that there wouldn't be any interference. But whenever there would be a crisis
                    you could see that this had now reached high levels and Fidel would become the
                    desk officer and whether or not we got the next set of supplies to do the next
                    stage of the refurbishment or whether we got permission to ship out the
                    containers from the previous shipment depended on very high level approval and
                    it just didn't budget because he was using it as an instrument of leverage
                    against us. He was in overall charge and with respect to the United States
                    sometimes that got down to the very minute levels of detail when he became the
                    “de facto” desk officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did we have any leverage on the Cubans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well we had the ultimate leverage, if we were willing to improve the
                    broader relationship. The Cubans wanted that very much but they wanted to do it
                    in a way that did not diminish the Communist Party's and Fidel's control of the
                    island and its people. The Clinton Administration wasn't prepared to enter those
                    negotiations. On more discrete issues, there were things, such as narcotics, on
                    which we could have cooperated more. But there I would say that the
                    Administration's concerns about the Miami community trumped in most cases any
                    willingness to expand official contacts much beyond regular meetings on
                    migration which had begun with the migration accord. So it really was a little
                    dance that never got very far and at the end of the day the Cubans, I think,
                    concluded that this was not going to work in their advantage and they became
                    increasingly more interested in doing everything they could to assert their
                    domestic control and not prepared to do anything in the interest of having an
                    improved relationship with the United States that would diminish their internal
                    control.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well speaking of our control and people I've interviewed
                        who dealt with Cuban affairs in an earlier period talked about Fidel's
                        almost systematically eliminating in one way or another of any possible
                        rivals. Did you feel, I mean was there at all another group?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yeah, I wouldn't call it a group but there were individuals whom he
                    might have perceived as potential rivals. Probably the number one example in my
                    time there was a young Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina who had been a Communist
                    youth leader which in Cuba typically means right up until the age of about 35 or
                    36, so youth is defined loosely. Robaina had been a university student leader
                    and then later a youth leader and shortly after that, probably only in his mid
                    to late 30s became foreign minister. He was flashy; he dressed a little bit like
                    a rock star. I remember he took a number of diplomats, including myself, on a
                    trip to the Isle of Youth. We did the usual things visiting the island. Then at
                    one point he walked down the main street in the capital and as he walked down
                    the street with a number of us accompanying him, a crowd of some dozens gathered
                    along the side of the street. They recognized him and would wave to him or come
                    up and greet him and shake his hand. In my own mind I said this is not going to
                    last, this is not going to be welcomed by Fidel. I'm not saying that one
                    incident was it but his readiness to cultivate a public image was not welcome.
                    The only one who really was able to maintain a public image was Fidel himself;
                    he didn't want anyone else...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to the gentleman?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: He lost his job maybe a year later with no public explanation and a few
                    rumors of corruption. Typically what happens to people these days is they aren't
                    executed, they aren't put up against the wall, they are put into, as the Cubans
                    call it, into “pajamas” so that they are no longer seen and when you ask a Cuban
                    official where such an individual is, they'd say well can't see him he is in
                    pajamas. That was it, you know, he was invisible. That happened more recently
                    with Carlos Lage, who for some years was the economic minister and later vice
                    prime minister up until about a year ago. He was, I would say, much more careful
                    than Robaina. He was low profile, he drove his own Lada around; he didn't have a
                    big public escort. He was not looking for public glory. But even then, about a
                    year ago, he was deposed. He had probably become too prominent and with all the
                    agitation at that point about whether Cuba was finally going to reform with
                    Raul, a more pragmatic figure in charge rather than Fidel, and people knowing
                    that Lage had originally been promoted by Raul, speculation increased about
                    whether Lage might be a potential successor to the Castro's. But certainly the
                    word successor is not a word that you want to have to describe you if you expect
                    to stay in a permanent position in Cuba.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Raul seen, at the time you were doing this, as
                        certainly I don't want to say the great white hope but as maybe a possible
                        opening of something happened or...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I think the little story I told earlier about he and army generals
                    going to Fidel, I think, reflected the image that he had. He tended to promote
                    relatively pragmatic economists, give then a little bit of space; he was more
                    pragmatic, less theological than Fidel, even though he had been a Communist well
                    before Fidel became a Communist. He also took a pretty low profile role for
                    somebody who was minister of defense and already then the designated public
                    successor to Fidel. He gave his ritual speeches, he wasn't very charismatic. He
                    had little contact with foreigners, or at least with Westerners and deliberately
                    stayed in the shadow of his brother. I think the assessment of him probably was
                    correct that he is somewhat more pragmatic than Fidel. He is no more willing
                    than Fidel to cede Communist Party and Castro control over the island but he is
                    more willing to adopt pragmatic and economic policies and do things that make
                    more economic sense and more interested in giving Cubans a better life so long
                    as it doesn't endanger the political control.</p>

                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well I would say among the great public, it was happening almost
                    universally. The analogy I used to use in my time there that say if you date
                    this to the mid-'90s I think it was broadly accurate. Almost everybody over 35
                    who had remained in Cuba (because many had the opportunity to leave and had not
                    taken it), had at one point viewed Fidel as their father. He was their father
                    figure and maybe their grandfather figure now. In any case, that generation of
                    now 50 plus had a special feeling towards him, even if they wished their father
                    would retire and let them be normal people in a normal country. I think that
                    still continues for the most part among that generation, but that generation's
                    faith in Marxism had largely disappeared except for the very small coterie, the
                    thousands of people in the higher levels of the bureaucracy, Marxism and
                    socialist internationalism had largely disappeared from their vocabulary; it
                    didn't work for them. I met many, many Cubans some of them had volunteered to
                    fight in Angola on behalf of what was then the Cuban ministry of interior which
                    was running that show. One fellow said to me, “I wasted my life, I put my life
                    on the line for something that was an illusion.” In the under 35 generation,
                    they had not really made an active choice for Fidel or for the revolution or
                    Marxism, but had grown up in the system without ever really having an
                    alternative. I would say the vast majority in that group either wanted to leave
                    the island or they wanted a job where they could earn dollars being a busboy or
                    chamber maid in a tourist hotel where they could make some dollars and earn some
                    money. Even the sons and daughters of the Cuban security elite were anxious to
                    get jobs in tourism where they could secure a bit of foreign exchange. So, there
                    was wide spread disillusionment with ideology per se, with the exception of the
                    fairly narrow circles of power.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Cuban equivalent of the secret police or
                        the KGB types? Were they harassing you all much or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I would say in the beginning, constrained by the economic problems that
                    affected the whole island, they didn't have as many resources to follow us. But
                    as time went on, and probably again marked fairly accurately in the summer of
                    '94 when Fidel decided that he needed to reoccupy the streets, priority
                    resources began to be devoted to the security services and they had more
                    resources to follow us, to interfere with us. They were not as nasty as they had
                    been sometimes in the past. In some past years there had been incidents of
                    defecating in people's apartments just to send a message that they had been
                    there and making sure you knew they had been there and gone through your stuff.
                    It wasn't as much flagrant nastiness but it was there and to the degree that we
                    were active with the opposition and with the human rights activists they were
                    particularly on us about those activities. We had a human rights officer who at
                    one stage I remember she was regularly used to being followed in her car going
                    down Fifth Avenue. On one occasion, she had just made it through a traffic
                    light. The security services' car behind her went through the red light and got
                    hit from the side and flipped over. Robin Meyer stopped her car and went back
                    and found the security officer following her extremely embarrassed, but not
                    seriously injured. Certainly she was very used to being followed and by 1996,
                    they became increasingly aggressive. When we get to '96 I'll tell you just how
                    aggressive.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is December 2, 2010.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I thought I should elaborate on the people-to-people exchanges that I
                    mentioned earlier and which were part of Clinton Administration policy toward
                    Cuba, as they are part of Obama Administration policy today. I believed in these
                    exchanges strongly, not because I thought they would change the Cuban regime,
                    but because the Cuban and American people are destined to live 90 miles apart
                    and it was and is important to have our two people know each other and each
                    other's cultures. This is an enduring reality long after the Castro regime is a
                    footnote in history. The other part of my belief in the value of
                    people-to-people exchanges is my skepticism of the argument that the relatively
                    small proceeds which the Cuban government gains from such exchanges will somehow
                    be the difference in preventing the Castro regime from falling.</p>
                <p>One area in which we were more open was in allowing Cuban and American musicians
                    to travel more freely. Chucho Valdes, a famous Cuban jazz pianist, who had not
                    been able to travel to the US since the 1970's, received a visa to visit the US,
                    and I remember him saying that he did not sleep in New York because he did not
                    want to miss one minute of opportunity to listen to and absorb American jazz.
                    I'll give some detail on how obstacles on both sides complicated even cultural
                    exchanges. Upon his return, Chucho came to my house and asked if we could bring
                    American jazz pianist Billy Taylor, a Kennedy Center institution, to give jazz
                    instruction and participate in the Havana Jazz Festival. Because of the
                    resistance from Cuban-Americans in Congress to spending any US government funds
                    on such an exchange, the US had to secure private funding to sponsor the
                    cultural exchange, but we did so and Billy Taylor agreed to come and
                    participate. In the meantime, Chucho Valdes, while he was in the U.S. had
                    recruited two very good musicians Roy Hargrove and Steve Coleman to come with
                    their groups and play and they did come. Billy Taylor's wife had a fall and he
                    was not able to come but the cultural exchange went well, notwithstanding, and
                    Roy Hargrove wound up recording a Cuban-themed album together with Chucho
                    Valdes. The other side of complications with cultural exchanges was demonstrated
                    by the Cuban government, probably because Valdez had gotten out in front of them
                    in coming to my house asking for our assistance in bringing Billy Taylor to the
                    Havana Jazz Festival. The Cuban government punished Chucho by removing him as
                    the director of the Havana Jazz Festival, even though he continued to be the
                    leading Cuban musician at the festival. Valdez was sort of banished for awhile.
                    When he was invited to our July 4 reception, my last in country, Chucho waited
                    until all the Cuban government watchers had left and came by about 10:30 at
                    night just to say goodbye. It was difficult for both sides, with constraints and
                    hardliners who resisted even cultural exchanges.</p>

                        between literally both sides on this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Sure, absolutely. The most troubling incident of my whole tour in Cuba
                    is even a better example of that. I remember the date of February 24, 1996. The
                    group called itself Brothers to the Rescue, small aircraft pilots, typically
                    using Cessna's. They had initially founded themselves to find Cuban rafters out
                    in the sea who could then be picked by the Coast Guard and brought to the United
                    States. Well after the migration agreement of 1994, that mission had largely
                    evaporated and yet this group wished to continue being active. It became public
                    later that the organization had been infiltrated by one Cuban who had come to
                    the U.S. as a refugee but was still working for the Cuban government. In any
                    case, one day in late January or early February, rather than just patrolling the
                    island around the seas to see if there were any Cubans possibly out there that
                    needed to be rescued, since there were very few these days, as the Cuban
                    government was enforcing its borders again, one or two Cessna pilots flew over
                    Havana and dropped leaflets on Havana. This was considered a terrific act and a
                    great act of heroism on the part of these people by some circles in Miami.</p>
                <p>Well, in the following weeks the Cuban government got itself increasingly
                    exercised about this. They went to the State Department to indicate how irate
                    and concerned they were about it and they called me in to tell me the same
                    thing. Now I think there were talks held with this organization and with Miami
                    activists to try to persuade these people not to take chances and not to
                    provoke. We also urged the Cuban government in Havana and in Washington not to
                    overreact. That withstanding I think the U.S. message was probably tempered on
                    both sides because the US was in the middle and seeking to not alienate the
                    Miami community. When Brothers to the Rescue flew again February 24 the Cuban
                    air force was prepared with information from their infiltrator and they followed
                    the Cessna's and shot down two of those Cessna planes, killing several of the
                    individuals involved. This caused great uproar in the US and internationally and
                    led to the then US representative to the UN Madeline Albright quoting from the
                    Cuban pilot who had been monitored by us to have yelled out “cojones”, balls,
                    that he was going to shoot this guy down. She used that tape, in effect, to
                    dismiss the Cuban claim at the United Nations that they either had no
                    responsibility or that the act had occurred inside Cuba, but we had
                    documentation that they had deliberately shot down unarmed small planes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well in a way somebody would try that over Washington
                        today they sure as hell would get shot down.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: True, true. These were Cessna's but they were still provocations and
                    yet because the United States was sort of being equally careful about Miami in
                    ways that we were anxious that no clash occur, but were not willing to act in
                    strong ways to prevent these people from flying. Simultaneously with that and on
                    the same day, the Cuban government conducted a major sweep on human rights
                    activists and dissidents on the island rounding up many of them and putting them
                    in jail. There were many such arrests over the years, but this was the first
                    large-scale crackdown in a number of years. So I think it coincided with a Cuban
                    decision to crack down in general on internal and external threats as they saw
                    them.</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>I guess one of the interesting side lights of this was a conversation on that
                    Saturday with the individual in the Foreign Ministry charged with U.S. affairs.
                    There was an interesting dialogue, at first, as the Cubans were trying to
                    measure how we were going to deal with this. Were we going to deal with it as an
                    unfortunate incident, but not seek to hold the Cuban government totally
                    responsible? I, of course, acting on instructions from Washington, made it clear
                    that we knew they were totally responsible and we would make it clear to
                    everybody that the Cuban government had made a deliberate decision to use its
                    air force jets to shoot down unarmed small aircraft. At a certain point, the
                    Cuban tone changed radically and I could feel basically Fidel Castro assuming
                    full control again of the U.S. desk, as he did whenever a crisis arose and the
                    Cuban message sharpened greatly. Basically it was saying the hell with you, you
                    are not getting any apologies, we are not going to be expressing regrets, they
                    had it coming, you should have known better and that was it.</p>
                <p>At that point relations took a nose dive and the Clinton administration was
                    looking at means to retaliate. It wound up dropping its opposition to the
                    Helms-Burton legislation, suspending all charter flights into Cuba for at least
                    a number of months, and then, disastrously, in my view, limiting the travel of
                    Cuban diplomats in Washington, notwithstanding our advice that this will just
                    give the Cuban government a great excuse to do the same things to the US
                    Interests Section. And that indeed was what happened. I would say from that
                    point on, this led to a progressive spiral downward in relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting good reports on what is almost a foreign
                        power and that is the Miami Cubans. One, they were clearly violating
                        international law by what they were doing. Were they trying to provoke this?
                        It doesn't sound like they were coming out ahead on it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I don't think that they planned their own deaths. That is certainly
                    more than they wished, but certainly to be provocative and aggressive in the
                    face of the Cuban authorities, was certainly an attractive position in Miami. As
                    I mentioned before, Cuban intelligence had, in fact, infiltrated a pilot within
                    that group who I'm sure was able to tell them precisely when they would be
                    traveling and that infiltrator departed Miami on that Saturday for the Bahamas
                    and subsequently for Cuba. He abandoned the “temporary” wife that he had taken
                    in Florida, came back to Cuba and reintegrated with the regime. So the Cubans
                    knew what was coming, perhaps even more than American authorities..</p>
                <p>As far as the Miami-Cubans, I think Washington, the Department did have direct
                    contact with them. Washington was in very frequent contact with several elements
                    within the community, and I believe there was a prior contact with his Brothers
                    to the Rescue operation to seek to dissuade them, but I don't think the message
                    was as strong as it might have been.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened now? Was the Coast Guard still at this point
                        intercepting people and bringing them back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yes and they continued to. I think there may have been a stall for some
                    weeks or even a month but eventually those returns continued. We continued to be
                    able to travel out to visit the people who were returned. The travel of our own
                    interest section staff throughout the island was constrained, made more
                    difficult; we had to provide advance notification although at that point it was
                    only to provide advance notification and didn't require us to wait for approval.
                    Subsequently, I think some years after I left, the Cubans imposed the
                    requirement that people wait until that approval came through, and as used to
                    happen in Moscow, that approval never came through. So typically Interests
                    Section staff could not travel any longer around the island. Eventually that
                    restriction became to confine American staff to the city limits of Havana, which
                    was extremely restrictive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did this do to the morale of your group there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well it made it more difficult. The period that I was there because I
                    left in the summer of '96, people were still able to travel but with the
                    uncertainty of whether the authorities might stop them from traveling. The
                    hostility of the Cuban government was greater and particularly our human rights
                    officer had to deal with the incident I described earlier when she was being
                    followed so closely that she made it through a red light but her Cuban follow
                    car didn't and wound up getting broadsided and flipped over. The agent who was
                    following her was very upset when she came back to check on him. But still there
                    were other instances of unpleasantness too, but it was not as bad as in the
                    '80s. Certainly it was more difficult for everybody and there was pretty
                    significant tension. The ability to have relationships with private Cubans was
                    also inhibited, as the regime began putting pressure on Cubans to shun us. We
                    were also increasingly focused on those human rights activists who had been
                    arrested or harassed, which attention the Cuban government detested.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In our going out and checking on people and all what about
                        the area near Guantanamo? Was that pretty much off limits for everyone?</hi>

                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: No, we could go there. I mean there were very few instances of people
                    penetrating the base in order to seek asylum and most of the people I would say
                    the majority of the people who fled the island were from either Havana or from
                    the provinces along the northern seafront where they would seek to cross the
                    Florida straits to the US or the Bahamas. But I visited the province of
                    Guantanamo one time myself and my observation certainly was that while the
                    central government showed its great hostility with respect to our presence in
                    Guantanamo Bay, the local residents in many cases, particularly the older ones,
                    remembered when relations were pretty amicable with the base on the other side.
                    Some Cubans continued to work at the American base for many years, although
                    those numbers were diminishing; they were being replaced by Jamaicans over time
                    because the Cubans had begun to put up barriers to our hiring new Cubans to work
                    there.</p>
                <p>The only way I was able to get to the US base at Guantanamo was flying on one
                    occasion from Miami basically around the island without any overflight of Cuban
                    territory on a Navy plane and then visiting I believe for two days, talking to
                    American officials there and then flying back out the same way. So the
                    Guantanamo Base was totally separated from Cuba and from us in Havana. One
                    interesting thing that occurred in that time was that the U.S. military and our
                    Coast Guard and narcotics authorities all had some interest in having an
                    improved relationship with the Cuban government to pursue their particular
                    interests. In the military side it was first and foremost that relations along
                    the base be amicable and that there be no incidents of the sort that occurred in
                    that famous Jack Nicholson movie ...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A Few Good Men, I think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: That's right.</p>
                <p>Yes, so the U.S. changed base commanders about every six months. And each time
                    that they changed the command there would be a high-level visit typically from
                    CINCLANT, which was the responsible regional command to be present and have a
                    few words with the Cuban regional military authorities. So the Cubans certainly
                    welcomed this and liked the idea that somehow they might be able to have an
                    improved military-to military relationship. The U.S. military, at least for that
                    narrow purpose and probably in some instances even hoping for a little bit more,
                    was also interested in that. One CINCLANT commander who had great aspirations,
                    Jack Sheehan, got a little bit too close and his video-taped encounter with the
                    Cuban general, calling him “Mi General”, My General, was used against him in the
                    Cuban community in Miami and perhaps damaged his prospects to rise to even
                    greater heights within the US military.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did life within Havana for you change at all as time
                        went on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well it changed in the sense that certainly after February '96 the
                    Cuban government began to be more aggressive with its own population and be more
                    aggressive and less flexible with us in the interest section. People would get
                    harassed, mostly in minor ways but would be harassed. I think the Cuban people,
                    for the most part, were still interested in having contact with us. They
                    increasingly had found their lost relatives in the U.S. and many of them had the
                    ambition to get there themselves. Others saw the U.S. as their protector in
                    their pursuit of human rights or greater political openness so we still had, I
                    think, pretty good access to the Cuban people. Our contacts with the government
                    were increasingly stiff and formal with no real aspiration on either side that
                    that relationship would improve in any near term.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were they getting their oil?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: At that point on the open market largely. There was plenty of oil out
                    there on the open market, but they were paying top dollar price for it as
                    opposed to the Soviet subsidy, which had subsidized an enormous portion of the
                    cost for them, to the degree that they were notorious wasters of petroleum
                    because it basically came free. But the high cost of petroleum was an enormous
                    constraint on Cuba and that is why they had set up this system of trying to get
                    more dollars by means of remittances, through dollar stores, through more
                    tourists coming into the island but it was certainly a far tougher existence
                    than it had been in the years of reportedly calculated up to $5 billion a year
                    Soviet subsidy.</p>
                <p>It was in that period that Fidel received with some ceremony Venezuelan Colonel
                    Hugo Chavez, who had just been released from prison where he had served time for
                    an attempted military coup. Fidel and the Cubans were certainly placing their
                    bets on a future sugar daddy. It certainly seemed a long shot at the time, but
                    has resulted in a new source of subsidized petroleum for Cuba.</p>

                        medicine and stuff like that in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yeas we did and I think I may have covered that we did almost from the
                    beginning of my time there in '93-'94 had agreed to license shipments into Cuba
                    by, in effect, the Catholic Church of the United States. These were shipments of
                    medicine that they would go to CARITAS, the Cuban Catholic organization which
                    would in turn distribute it to Cuban hospitals and also monitor it to make sure
                    the state didn't abuse or sell it. CARITAS had Catholic doctors or nurses assure
                    them and so the US would allow medical supply donations to continue. We had not
                    yet opened up as yet to sales of medicines and of food to the Cuban government
                    in that period. In my farewell cable, I recommended that we relax the embargo to
                    permit sales of medicine and food. This was one element of the embargo that had
                    very little justification, since the Cubans would still have to come up with the
                    cash in order to purchase from the US. Eventually the Clinton administration
                    did, I believe in about 1999, end the embargo on medicine and food.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I got the impression, this is just from reading the
                        papers, that the Helms-Burton Act was mainly aimed at Canadian outfits or
                        was this effective or was it hitting anybody particularly hard?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: You are right that one of the main provisions in it called for any
                    individual or corporation utilizing expropriated American property to be
                    blacklisted and face certain potential risks in doing business in the United
                    States. There was at least one large Canadian company, Sherritt, that was
                    running the old American nickel mining operation in Moa in the northeast that
                    became one of the most publicized cases. The broad provision of extraterritorial
                    punishment though was so unusual that it produced great anxiety particularly in
                    the European Union and led to every US Administration, including the Bush II
                    Administration, waiving the penalties as applied to third country individuals
                    and corporations. But where this came from was the mistaken belief that the
                    Castro regime was about to fall and all that was necessary was one last twist
                    and cutting off one last source of foreign exchange in order for that regime to
                    fall. I actually had a conversation just as I left Cuba with the responsible
                    individuals in Congress, including Congressman Dan Burton, the House sponsor of
                    this legislation. I remember him looking intently at me and asking me, “Now that
                    this legislation has passed, is this going to topple the regime?” I said, “With
                    all due respect, Congressman, no it is not.” He replied, “Well you just tell me
                    what else we need to do and we'll do that and we'll bring them down.” It was
                    almost an ideological view that US action could produce the desired results.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in '96, is that it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel because you hadn't brought down the Castro
                        regime that you were some how tainted or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I don't think so. Everybody who goes in there has the hope that they
                    will be there when change comes. In some people's cases their parents or their
                    grandparents had honeymooned in Cuba and they could come back or this could be a
                    much more open place. But I think I gradually became aware that that wasn't
                    going to happen, but I don't think I was held personally responsible by many
                    except perhaps by Congressman Dan Burton.. I had also maintained contact with
                    was the Cuban-American members of Congress, maybe once a year or so. I'd go call
                    on them to hear them out and give them my honest views of what was going on. I
                    had some familiarity with them and tried to get them to understand as well that
                    they should not have excessive expectations. Underneath their public
                    pronouncements in many cases, I think they recognized that this was not likely
                    to happen in the near term and the administration had had every reason to have
                    similarly modest expectations.</p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>I would give some credit to the Clinton administration for opening increased
                    people-to-people exchanges, and then even after the aircraft shoot down, for
                    maintaining the increased exchanges, the people-to-people contacts, etc., which
                    really was a long-term policy rather than a short-term policy. No one should
                    expect that anything you can do in the short-term is going to change Cuba. But
                    people who are 90 miles away will be our neighbors forever and we should do what
                    we can to improve that people-to-people contacts and relationships.</p>

                        that was after your time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: The boy refugee, Elian Gonzalez? Oh the young boy, that was actually in
                    2000, four years after I left and it probably did affect Gore's vote in the 2000
                    election.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We may have covered these earlier on but what about
                        foreign leaders? I've been interviewing Jim Cason who's said, “Foreign
                        leaders would come and fall under the spell of Castro, the mystique of
                        Castro.” Did you see much of that particularly as time went on when you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well, I guess probably the most interesting case were the Spaniards
                    because certainly Fidel is and was very charismatic. Congressmen or other
                    prominent Americans, who came and got the six hour treatment beginning at 1
                    a.m., usually left under some sort of a spell that this guy was at least
                    charming and a great raconteur. The Spaniards, of course, had a special case;
                    Cuba was their last and favorite colony until 1898 and they had a certain degree
                    of resentment against the United States for intervening on behalf of Cuban
                    independence. So the Spaniards made a major effort to improve the relationship
                    and to convince the European Union to open up to Cuba. In fact, their foreign
                    minister came to Cuba and made a major public effort. That, as well as a number
                    of other initiatives, were crushed in part by the February 24 shoot down of the
                    aircraft. Even people who would have thought the pilots were foolhardy and the
                    U.S. government should have done more to prevent it could not forgive the Cubans
                    sending out their air force MIG's to shoot down unarmed Cessna's and many of
                    those initiatives for openings went under.</p>
                <p>Fidel is always very clever so at the same time some relationships were taking a
                    hit he was always cultivating others. I recall that in the period after Hugo
                    Chavez had attempted a coup and spent some time in jail, he was received in
                    Havana airport with Fidel going out to receive him at the airport like a head of
                    state, clearly building a relationship that paid off a few years later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So where did you go when you left in '96?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I came back to Washington and I did a year in something called the
                    Special Coordinator for Haiti in late August, 1996. I had some hope that my time
                    in Cuba would have purified me to have an ambassadorial nomination but the
                    administration was not ready to push me forward as yet. Strobe Talbot, the
                    deputy secretary, had been taking a very strong interest in Haiti, particularly
                    after the U.S. had sent in troops to restore Aristide. This had become quite a
                    controversial issue, and Strobe, because he was close to President Clinton and
                    had once been his roommate, was a particular focus of the Congressional
                    criticism as a proxy for criticizing the President. It was an interesting period
                    and the deputy secretary had a lot of interest in the issue, as did some people
                    in the White House, including NSC Adviser Sandy Berger. At the beginning of my
                    year there, the issue was very hot politically in a presidential election year.
                    Republicans had warned against inserting U.S. troops both because some predicted
                    many would return in body bags, which did not happen, but also because they
                    thought that Aristide was not worthy of restoration. So in 1996, many
                    Republicans were going to be very hard on the administration certainly up until
                    the election and perhaps after. Strobe Talbot, who had faced heavy congressional
                    pressure while testifying earlier, clearly preferred not to testify at future
                    hearings. So in hearings in the fall of 1996, our Ambassador to Haiti Bill Swing
                    and I were sent up to testify.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were sort of designated fall guy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: It certainly was a no win situation. I remember Florida Congressman
                    Porter Goss, who had been very reasonable in private meetings with me, asking me
                    questions at public testimony that would have required revealing classified
                    information in open session to respond well. And Republican members of Congress
                    certainly were harshly critical of the Administration during that hearing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah. What was your personal opinion of Aristide that you
                        developed as you got into this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: By then he had given up the presidency. He had been persuaded by the US
                    not to change the constitution to allow him to run for another term. Yet his
                    successor, President Rene Preval, who served again as president of Haiti until
                    recently, was at that point very much beholden to Aristide and reluctant to do
                    very much without Aristide's blessing. I only met Aristide on one occasion and
                    thought he was very intelligent and capable, but we knew he had utilized
                    violence for his own political ends an had been personally corrupt. But Aristide
                    was very charismatic and extremely popular with the poorest sector of the
                    Haitian population. Aristide also had his following in the United States as well
                    as internationally, so it was a complicated situation and one that we were
                    working principally with the current elected president of Haiti Preval, while
                    conscious of Aristide's influence behind the scenes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was Aristide at the time? Was he still in
                        Haiti?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yes, he was living in Port-au-Prince. I remember that my one meeting
                    with him was while accompanying former NSC Adviser Tony Lake, who had a
                    longstanding relationship with Aristide. We met with Preval and then later went
                    over to meet Aristide. I don't remember the substance of the conversation, but
                    the purpose was to seek Aristide's cooperation in allowing Preval to do those
                    things we felt necessary to address political and economic crises.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Black Caucus involved in this whole business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yes they were and I once accompanied a fairly large delegation from the
                    black caucus, which included Judge Conyers of Michigan, William Jefferson of
                    Louisiana, Robert Scott of Virginia, accompanied by Congressman Bill Delahunt of
                    Massachusetts. Judge Conyers from Detroit was probably the most prominent and
                    most adamant of greatly increased US assistance to Haiti; he talked of a
                    Marshall Plan for Haiti. Many of his colleagues recognized that that was not
                    going to happen and were looking for more realistic solutions. In my position, I
                    used to go see the Black Caucus in Washington fairly frequently, as well. They
                    had been strong advocates of the US intervention to restore Aristide to power
                    and were in 1996-97 supporters of the Administration on Haiti. There were a few
                    Republicans, including Senator Mike DeWine of Ohio, who were advocating
                    compromise between the Congress and the Administration on Haiti. But many
                    Republicans were interested, at least until after the November presidential
                    elections, in using Haiti as a bludgeon against the administration.</p>
                <p>Indeed in one of the Presidential or Vice Presidential debates, the Republican
                    candidate raised a criticism of Administration policy in Haiti. The issue never
                    took off, as, in my view, most Americans had no interest in Haiti at that stage,
                    except perhaps for African-Americans who had overwhelmingly supported US
                    intervention.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were pretty much put into the furnace.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: That's right. Haiti I would be the first one to say that Haiti is a
                    very messy environment with very little going for it and it frustrates you every
                    day. You come into a Haiti job with aspirations that things can go better but in
                    Haiti, they usually don't. I recall in my first month on the job, there were
                    several killings perpetrated by the presidential guard and so that became a
                    major issue and needed to be addressed. Things are always complicated in
                    Haiti.</p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>On Haiti as I mentioned the worst part of the job was that period prior to the
                    presidential elections of November 1996 when the Republican Party was bound and
                    determined to make the case that President Clinton's decision to send American
                    troops into Haiti was a wrong one, that Aristide should not have been restored
                    and what was left was a mess. I had gone through a number of Congressional
                    testimonies and other difficult meetings. But, once that election, of course,
                    was over I would say most interest was lost; there was no remaining US political
                    issue there, but there were a few Congressmen and, most notably staff, who
                    retained interest.</p>
                <p>Some Congress people, notably Senator Mike DeWine of Ohio had a very positive
                    interest in helping to resolve what is almost a perpetual impasse in Haiti and
                    in finding ways for the United States to provide effective help. Some of the
                    staffers, I would say not so much. But there was one staffer who later emerged
                    again as a foreign policy adviser in the McCain presidential campaign, Randy
                    Scheunemann. At that point I think Scheunemann was working for Senate Republican
                    leader Dole. So basically his pitch to the Congressional affairs office of the
                    State Department and to me was that most Republican's wanted to get this issue
                    off our plate and come to some sort of agreement. So I was consulting with
                    Strobe Talbot, the deputy secretary of State and we agreed that we also wanted
                    to get it done and yes we could make some agreements with the Congress to reach
                    a bipartisan compromise.</p>
                <p>So I was the designated sacrificial lamb and sent up to the Congress with a
                    delegation of people from AID and State in December, 1996 for a meeting with a
                    large group of Congressional staff, mostly Republicans but also Democratic
                    staff. We spent, I recall, four hours that first day with me handling many
                    questions and other people handling some but many of the questions were the
                    impossible to answer questions of the “when did you stop beating your wife”
                    variety. But we did the best we could and were being told that this would
                    eventually bring good results. So, we did that for four hours and afterwards
                    Scheunemann, the intermediary in this process told us that some of these people
                    still want more so can you come back tomorrow. So as I recall, I went back the
                    next day and met with the only staffers who showed up, Republicans, for a
                    two-hour replay. Then Scheunemann called that afternoon to say, “Well there was
                    one Senate appropriations staffer who couldn't make so he wants to see you
                    tomorrow.” So again up there and I would say 45 minutes of getting beaten around
                    and then eventually we got the deal done. I recall it was just before Christmas
                    and I recall as I am flying up to Boston a day or so later saying to myself,
                    “Gee, that wasn't so bad, I only got beaten up for an hour today.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh God.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Then while in Boston over Christmas I said, these are my words, “I need
                    a new life, this is not a good day when you feel good about only getting beaten
                    up for an hour.” So just after the New Year, when David Welch, the DAS in NEA
                    approached me to ask if I would I be interested in taking on the Israel-Lebanon
                    Monitoring Group, I took about five seconds to think and said, “Sure, getting
                    beaten up by Israeli, Lebanese and Syrians sounds a lot more fun than being
                    beaten up by Congressmen and Congressional staffers for hours on end.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well in this getting beaten up did you feel that the
                        Congress...that you were getting beaten up on both sides?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: No, no at that point the Democrats were basically supportive of the
                    Clinton administration, anxious to have assistance resumed, the Black Caucus in
                    particular was a strong supporter of assistance to Haiti so the critique was
                    overwhelmingly by Republicans. Democrats spoke up only occasionally at that
                    first meeting, but they really didn't have an interest in going to six hours of
                    meetings on Haiti. I'll concede that some staffers probably were sincere in
                    their opposition to the U.S. continuing in what they thought a feckless effort
                    to resolve Haitian problems. But looking at Haiti for in the longer term, it was
                    not in our interest to let Haiti wallow. Did the US wish to neglect Haiti in
                    such a way the result would be an almost inevitable mass migration to the U.S.?
                    I think most members of Congress probably would have said they want this
                    resolved. And at the end of the day that's probably why they were willing to
                    make a bipartisan accord to continue assistance dependent on certain conditions.
                    Some of the conditions could be delivered on and others not, so this made the
                    congressional engagement continuous and made for a tough job.</p>
                <p>So I was ready to leave when David Welch asked if I would be interested in
                    Israel-Lebanon Monitoring Group and I became co-chair of the Israel-Lebanon
                    Monitoring Group in about July of 1997 for about a year until I was selected as
                    Ambassador to Angola.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well Joe it looks like you went from success to success.
                        You settled Cuba, settled Haiti and now we will be talking how you made

                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yes, it is unbelievable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well the nice thing about it is as career opportunities
                        these things don't get solved.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you are off to the peace and tranquility of the

                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Right, exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can't remember had you served there before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I served four years in Israel in the mid-eighties and so this return to
                    the Middle East was as co-chairman of the Israel-Lebanon Monitoring Group it was
                    called.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: From approximately July of 1997 until approximately May of 1998. There
                    had been one prior American co-chair, David Greenlee, who had had it for the
                    first year and technically we ended up swapping jobs. He came back to Haiti to
                    be the Haiti special coordinator, while I went out there and did the co-chairman
                    of this monitoring group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he Bolivia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yeah, he's done...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think about four tours in Bolivia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yes, most recently as Ambassador to Bolivia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, what was the status of the Middle East Arab-Israeli
                        situation when you got there in May or June of '97?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Okay, when I got there, Netanyahu was prime minister. There were peace
                    American process efforts underway with Dennis Ross, the special negotiator, and
                    we used to meet periodically. When I would be back in Washington I would consult
                    with Dennis and give him a briefing on what we had been doing on our part. His
                    focus, of course, was overwhelmingly the core countries and only occasionally
                    focused on Lebanon but was anxious that the situation not flare up again. The
                    agreement on the monitoring group had actually been reached prior to Netanyahu
                    becoming Prime Minister. The agreement in April of 1996 in the course of what
                    had been called the Grapes of Wrath Operation by the Israeli government into
                    South Lebanon was in retribution for missiles fired into Northern Israel. In the
                    course of the operation, the Israelis had launched shells which wound hitting
                    Palestinian refugees taking shelter in the shadow of a UN camp in Q-A-N-A and
                    resulted in the death of I believe a hundred people. The Palestinians were from
                    refugee camps nearby and had clustered around the U.N. compound in hopes of
                    avoiding getting hit in what was an ongoing series of battles between Israeli
                    and Lebanese forces, Hezbollah really. The incident created an international
                    furor.</p>
                <p>Secretary Christopher had gone out and negotiated an agreement with all sides and
                    that resulted in a ceasefire agreement/understanding in April of '96. The
                    understanding provided for establishing the monitoring group with the
                    participation of the Syrians, the Lebanese and the Israeli's. This Israeli's and
                    the Lebanese were the signatory parties to the agreement but the Syrians were
                    also going to be present in the monitoring group. The French had sort of pushed
                    their way into being co-chair and actually I must say that the French were very
                    careful in choosing their representatives as people who got along with
                    Americans. The French representatives were reasonable diplomats but the French
                    always had a certain interest in protecting the Lebanese government. That said,
                    the French and the US found ways to work together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you deal with both the Arab side and the Israeli
                        side?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yes, and how the process was set up, I think my first trip out I
                    accompanied David Greenlee in his last session. It was virtually weekly but
                    there was always a complaint by one side or the other that the other side had
                    violated the understanding. Most often the Lebanese side would complain that the
                    Israelis had violated the understanding by shelling near a civilian village and
                    the Israelis would occasionally complain as well that there had been a firing
                    that had gone into northern Israel. The actual attacks on the Lebanese side were
                    carried out by Hezbollah. So we would meet virtually every week to deal with the
                    one or several complaints. Often, if there was one complaint, the other side
                    would file its complaint in effect in response. We would have to reach an
                    understanding among all the sides in the course of however long it took.
                    Sometimes it would take as short as ten or twelve hours and sometimes it would
                    take four or five days. It was not predictable and it didn't always correlate to
                    the seriousness of the incident. In some ways, I think the Lebanese were
                    interested in using the mechanism to demonstrate that the Lebanese government
                    and the Lebanese army, that was the lead representative in the room, was taking
                    care of the civilian population in the area and they would sometimes hold on to
                    a point a very long time, even though it was a relatively minor incident that
                    didn't result in any casualties. Some portion of this also reflected Lebanese
                    politics vis-�-vis Hezbollah.</p>
                <p>The Israelis, of course, had an overall view that if they fired at a target, it
                    was because they had received fire from that target and that in most cases the
                    villages that were being complained about had long been abandoned and the houses
                    therein were being used as shields by the people firing at them. It was a weekly
                    enterprise, sometimes relatively easily resolved and other times not very
                    easily. Sometimes, we would think that there never would be the required
                    agreement among the parties. In at least one case, the conflict escalated to the
                    degree that there was indeed firing into Israel with several katyushas launched
                    into Israel and had some very substantial action by Israel inside south
                    Lebanon.</p>
                <p>At the end of the day, I would conclude that both sides had at that point an
                    interest in maintaining the accord; both of them got something out of it. The
                    Lebanese had at that point been able to avoid major Israeli operations within
                    south Lebanon for several years, although the Israelis continued to support the
                    south Lebanese army which was their proxy Lebanese force in the region,
                    comprised mostly of Christians. The Israelis could conclude that they had
                    largely avoided katyusha firing into northern Israel. So although both sides
                    complained mightily that the other side was being provocative and not respecting
                    the accord, at the end of the day they wanted to reach some understanding. Our
                    final phrase at the end of every meeting would be that both sides would commit
                    to full respect for the understanding in the future, at least until the next
                    time. Because the agreement of both sides was required in the final statement,
                    only rarely was there clear identification of one side or the other for having
                    violated the understanding in those communiqu�'s. One might find shading in one
                    or another direction that would indicate that, but not direct sharp language
                    because then both sides would not be able to agree to on a communiqu�.</p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>I think it did set the tone when relatively shortly after that when Ehud Barak
                    came to power as the Israeli prime minister, he decided to withdraw all troops
                    withdraw support for the south Lebanese army and end the Israeli effort to
                    maintain a security zone inside South Lebanon. It was perhaps in one sense a
                    conclusion after the experience with the understandings that it wasn't necessary
                    to have proxy forces in the region and that they could accomplish their
                    objectives in other ways. But, the major clash with Hezbollah several years ago
                    demonstrated the risks of not having a proxy South Lebanese army there to
                    protect their interests. The small U.S. and French delegations were based in
                    Cyprus, a neutral location. We would travel to a UNIFIL Headquarters in south
                    Lebanon in a UN facility to have the meetings. But I did travel on two occasions
                    to Beirut, Damascus and Jerusalem and Tel Aviv to have discussions with the
                    governments. Of course, predictable things were said, but the most memorable
                    discussion to me was the statement by the Lebanese army Commander that the
                    Lebanese Army was anxious to resume control of all parts of Lebanon and would
                    deploy to the border if the Israelis were to withdraw their support for the
                    south Lebanese army. Despite his words, this remained a question and when Israel
                    withdrew its support for the South Lebanese army, Hezbollah filled behind those
                    positions and the Lebanese National army did not challenge Hezbollah. So this
                    created the conditions for periodic clashes and on one occasion quite a
                    significant conflict in the following years.</p>
                <p>So that's about it on that other than to say you know it was an amicable
                    relationship on most of our parts, although the Lebanese and the Syrian
                    representatives virtually never spoke to the Israeli representatives outside the
                    formal meeting room. We all had pretty Spartan quarters with one outer room and
                    one back bedroom for each delegation. So on those sessions that lasted multiple
                    days, our delegation would have to trade off taking naps. The Syrian
                    representative who was a military officer enjoyed his role of most times not
                    into being actively in the acrimony between the Israeli and Lebanese sides, but
                    eventually being the final arbiter on the Lebanese position. He would encourage
                    us to come to him to help resolve any major issues and would take some pride
                    behind the scenes in telling the Lebanese representative to accept the
                    compromise positions that the French and American co-chairmen had put
                    forward.</p>
                <p>I'll note another interesting piece of history in view of current developments in
                    Syria. This same Syrian General used to speak to us, the French and American
                    delegations, of Syria's effective suppression of what he described as Muslim
                    fundamentalists in Hama in 1982, a government action reported to have killed
                    some 20,000 residents of Hama. The Syrian General stated that the Syrian
                    Government's action had helped assure that Syria did not have “the
                    fundamentalist problem” that other Arab governments had.</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>I should add one other incident during my time in this position. During one of my
                    two trips to Beirut for meetings with the Lebanese government, we traveled to
                    Mount Lebanon to meet with the Prime Minister, the late Rafiq Hariri. His was
                    one of the few Muslim houses on Mount Lebanon and looked down on most of the
                    Christian houses on the mountain. Well in the course of our conversation, one of
                    my team members asked a question that would have required a delicate response
                    regarding Syria. Hariri looked at the phone by his side and said that he would
                    answer the question, but not there. So he walked to the far side of the room
                    with us following and answered the question. Several years later, Hariri was
                    assassinated in a car bombing.</p>
                <p>The next thing I would leave to next time would be perhaps going on to
                    Angola.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Today is the second of February, Groundhog Day, 2011. When did you go to Angola
                    and how long were you there?</p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Okay, I went in November of 1998 and let's see left in the summer of
                    2001. Let me ask if you recall whether I covered sort of the confirmation
                    process which was...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No you didn't.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Okay, so I should start there and then move on to getting there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I had been doing the job based in Cyprus on Israel-Lebanon Monitoring
                    Group. I got called back from that because I had been nominated and needed to
                    prepare for the confirmation process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you concerned about the Cuban connection?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well ironically it wound up being the Haiti connection. The Cuban
                    connection wasn't a problem but the Haiti connection proved to be. The hearings,
                    which I recall, were held in July of 1998. There were about 11-12 nominees up
                    for African posts, three of us had a Haiti connection. Ambassador Bill Swing,
                    who had been ambassador to Haiti; Bob Felder who had been the DCM and myself who
                    had been a year previously the Haiti special coordinator. Then Senator John
                    Ashcroft was the chairman of the Africa subcommittee and had shown no particular
                    interest in Africa but that is where he wound up as committee chair. We had no
                    real notion that it would be heavy going other than we knew there were staff
                    members in that committee, particularly Republican staff members, who were very
                    hot on the issue of Haiti even though by then, of course, the fervor that I had
                    described earlier prior to the '96 presidential election passed. Still there
                    were staff members who still had Haiti on their mind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why we're doing these things I think people who read this
                        should understand that staff members particularly when they get a handle on
                        ambassadorial confirmations and all often can throw their weight around. It
                        happens again and again and again.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Sure and that is their opportunity to both make a policy point against
                    the Administration, pose a problem for the Administration, probably in most
                    cases even more than the nominee. In any case, the three of us were singled out,
                    as all the other Senators and nominees went through rather quickly. We got
                    questioned by committee members, no problem, but then Ashcroft, the committee
                    chair, asked to have us testify as a group separately. I would say we had about
                    an hour and twenty minutes of questions, as I recall, directed at the three of
                    us. Probably Bill Swing took the heaviest load but I took my share as well. I
                    think the factual questions we could all handle well enough, but the questions
                    of why didn't you prevent Aristide from exercising influence? Why did political
                    killings continue? These were complicated questions and there was no answer that
                    would satisfy. So we finished that hearing and then Ashcroft, in effect,
                    declined to move the process forward and declined to send it to the full
                    committee. In any case, none of the Africa nominees were confirmed in the set of
                    Senate confirmations processed before the August recess and so we were left
                    hanging.</p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>Bill Swing had been nominated as ambassador to Congo Kinshasa and just about that
                    point Congo Kinshasa erupted into pretty much a full scale civil war with
                    Rwandan and other forces entering into the country as well. The administration
                    chose to send him out on a recess appointment; so he went out. Separate from the
                    hearing process, I had to go up and meet with the staff of Senator Dodd on the
                    old Nicaragua questions that I had mentioned earlier but that meeting went
                    reasonably well. Senator Dodd did not pose an objection. I know the
                    administration was in constant contact with Ashcroft's staff and I think
                    eventually they didn't pose an objection and we went through, as I recall,
                    probably in October of 1998; so I could only really make concrete plans to leave
                    in late October, early November.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you handle this personally?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well it's never easy and I was good friends with Bill Swing and I just
                    felt bad for him that he had after a 35-year diplomatic career, about 20 years
                    of it as Ambassador, this very distinguished and able gentleman had been subject
                    to public ridicule. He was asked questions for which there was no answer
                    deliberately. It wasn't pleasant but what I had come to expect on Haiti after
                    having done that job a year before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't want to over dwell on this but I'm trying to
                        capture the political set at the time. Was Aristide somebody's darling or
                        somebody's villain? Was he a...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: He was a many Republicans' villain because he was populist, was viewed
                    as a Marxist, and because he clearly did engage in political chicanery and in
                    violence to serve his political ends and probably corruption as well. The
                    Clinton administration had exerted itself to assure that he did not change the
                    constitution to be able to run for reelection even though he was toying with the
                    idea of changing the constitution since he had been forced out of the country
                    for several years in a military coup. But he did not. That notwithstanding, the
                    candidate who eventually became president, Preval who later served again as
                    president of Haiti at that point was very much in Aristide's shadow. I think it
                    is too far to say that he took orders from Aristide but he certainly was
                    reluctant to act decisively if Aristide opposed a particular move. It is the
                    traditional battle of Congress against an administration, the Congress wants
                    decisive action particularly the opposition political party, which had at that
                    point held the majority in the Senate and the House, wants the administration to
                    bring the villains to account and put all other concerns aside. The
                    administration is always playing a balance and in the case of Haiti it was a
                    balance that involves trying to nurture some sort of democratic institutions, it
                    was a balance of trying to avoid mass migration from Haiti to the United States,
                    if chaos prevails. So it was all of those things, and particularly left over
                    from the past, was the Republican disagreement with the Clinton administration
                    decision to invade Haiti and topple the military coup leaders and restore
                    Aristide to power back in about 1994.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Aristide still popular with the Black Caucus or other
                        elements within the Democratic Party?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Sure he was. He was close to many members within the Black Caucus and
                    they were generally quite supportive of him. He also had friends who were, at
                    that point, no longer in the administration but close to the administration.
                    Tony Lake, the former NSC advisor had a good personal relationship with Aristide
                    and in the days when I had responsibility for Haiti, I had made one trip with
                    Tony Lake who met to counsel prudence from Aristide to which he said the right
                    thing and he nodded it in the right places, but at the end of the day did his
                    own thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right then we are talking about October of what
                        '98?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You got your approval.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I got my approval but we never really dealt with the key question on
                    Angola, in the hearing process or anywhere else in the process frankly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But at the time you went out there what was the situation
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: The situation was that there had been a peace agreement negotiated and
                    agreed to by the two principal parties, the government and UNITA, the armed
                    opposition, from 1994. The guarantors of that peace agreement were the United
                    Nations, the United States, Russia and Portugal. That agreement was proving
                    increasingly fragile and problematic. It was widely suspected, although not
                    documented, that UNITA, which had agreed to confine itself to limited areas of
                    the country and not to arm itself, was rearming and retraining for another round
                    of war. The UN peacekeeping forces could not document it, but there was
                    significant suspicion that UNITA was rearming.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where would they get their arms?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well there was the recently arrested and extradited merchant of death,
                    Victor Boot, the former Russian businessman, who was shipping the arms and
                    obtaining from many places, particularly the former Soviet Union, the Ukraine,
                    Bulgaria and other countries that had lots of tanks and other heavy artillery to
                    spare. So arms had been coming in and this was later documented quite fully that
                    UNITA was very prepared and had trained extensively. So the peace process was
                    breaking down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you getting from the CIA for example?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: They had some information, but not a lot. I think the policy, at that
                    point, of the United States was to just hope against hope that nobody would take
                    the initial action of returning to the terrible war situation, which had been
                    prevailing in the country for at least 30 years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: But I would say that the problem of denying unpleasant reality became
                    increasingly problematic at the time I went out there. I recall my first meeting
                    with the Angolan President in mid-November to present my credentials. As always
                    in those sessions you listen a lot, but then sought to convey our message that
                    the Angolan Government should not initiate military action. While he was a
                    restrained man, President dos Santos was angry at the United Nations, angry at
                    the guarantors of the peace agreement, including the US. In his view, based on
                    evidence that he thought he had, UNITA had already rearmed and was preparing to
                    go back to war and the guarantors had not provided effective prevention to
                    prevent UNITA from doing this. Now I should say that the United States and
                    others did support an increasing range of UN sanctions on UNITA over the
                    previous year because of well-founded suspicion that UNITA was not complying
                    with the peace agreement. But these sanctions were not effective because the
                    arms dealers UNITA was dealing with were prepared to act outside international
                    law and deliver arms behind the lines, and UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi was very
                    careful and clever about how he rearmed.</p>

                        what was your evaluation of its control and effectiveness?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well the government has been since independence a government of the
                    MPLA, a once Marxist Party, initially supported by the Soviet Union. As I
                    recall, that was the origin of the conflict at the time when the United States
                    supported the opposition to the MPLA after the Portuguese walked away from
                    Angola in 1974. There were several phases of the war, including several in which
                    we actually supported UNITA several years, covertly. So it was a complex
                    situation and one in which our own historical baggage was considerable. I'm sure
                    that within the Angolan government there were many who, if anything went bad,
                    suspected that the United States was returning to prior policies of seeking
                    their overthrow by supporting Savimbi again, even though the US had renounced
                    that option way back in the Bush I administration in '90 or '91. But the Angolan
                    government was ineffective and corruption was rampant. That notwithstanding, the
                    government had a reasonably effective armed force; kept the coastal areas
                    largely free of conflict and kept the considerable oil production flowing, of
                    which Chevron had a very large share and other American oil companies,
                    particularly EXXON also had a piece as well as French and British oil companies.
                    So Angola was a large and growing oil producer at that point. The Angolan
                    government as well had shown on several occasions that, notwithstanding military
                    challenges, it was always able to arm and train its forces and defeat the
                    periodic challenges that the UNITA rebel forces posed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now did UNITA and other rebel forces was there any
                        other sort of lurking power behind them or was this a self-generated
                        opposition?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well certainly in the past there had been others forces, initially
                    including China under Mao and later the United States and also apartheid South
                    Africa behind UNITA. By the late '90s, the Angolans suspected that now
                    post-apartheid South Africa was taking a benevolent, if not supportive, posture
                    toward UNITA. Post-apartheid South Africa had a not very positive relationship
                    with the Angolan government particularly once Mbeki assumed the South African
                    presidency in 1999. So there was at least some complicity on the part of other
                    African governments. I think most of the East European involvement was at that
                    point for reasons of profit rather than choosing sides. Whether it was the
                    government that actually made the money or the armed forces that controlled the
                    weapons that made the money probably varied. There did not appear to be any
                    particular preference for UNITA in Europe, but individuals and governments
                    certainly benefited financially from arms sold to UNITA, and in the case of
                    several countries later to the Angolan government as well.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The president of Angola is who now?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Jose Eduardo dos Santos and he actually has been president since 1979.
                    He did have one election in 1992 as the outcome of a peace agreement reached. In
                    that election, in a reasonably fair, internationally monitored election, he beat
                    Savimbi in the presidential contest. At that point Savimbi rejected the results
                    and basically went back to a war that took another two years to reach another
                    peace agreement, the last peace agreement, the Lusaka Peace Agreement, of 1994
                    that was breaking down, as I arrived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you after? Did you feel that you, being the
                        United States representative, weren't going to be a passive by-stander were
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well the initial hope going in, and certainly one which I had been
                    encouraged to pursue, was to try to hang on to the Lusaka peace agreement. We
                    had a new assistant secretary for Africa at the time, Susan Rice and Tom
                    Pickering was the undersecretary for political affairs. I think we were late in
                    abandoning a no longer viable U.S. policy. We tried to maintain the peace
                    accord, but that was not possible as UNITA had already rearmed and the Angolan
                    government was not going to listen to us anymore.The Angolan Government was
                    going to seek to preempt UNITA's ability to prevail in a military conflict.
                    That's what they did. They, in effect, initiated conflict preemptively, but
                    UNITA was indeed prepared for war and reacted massively. So there were very
                    heavy artillery exchanges, even in some provincial capitals, tremendous
                    destruction and tremendous human suffering, with the population from most of the
                    inland provinces having to flee to the provincial capitals or to capital city of
                    Luanda to live in tent camps to get out of the way of the conflict. So the
                    Government had demonstrated that UNITA had rearmed and was prepared to go to
                    war. UNITA at one stage captured one provincial capital, and that only for a
                    couple of weeks, but they certainly dominated many outlying areas in a number of
                    the inland provinces. So the conflict was very heavy, and most Angolans view
                    that last period as the bloodiest stage of the long civil war. From the point
                    where the conflict restarted, arms were mostly not as available to UNITA, since
                    the monitoring of what came into Angola stepped up and the potential
                    consequences for the suppliers of those weapons became more problematic. But the
                    Angolan government built up very substantially and used lots of their petroleum
                    proceeds to buy weapons to ensure that they could outgun UNITA.</p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>So within a month from when I arrived in Angola, the war had restarted. Our
                    communications with the Angolan government were very bad at that point; they
                    really were not interested in hearing from us or from the UN or anybody who
                    would urge restraint. At one point in late December 1998, two UN planes
                    evacuating UN materiel from the conflict zones were shot down; one of them
                    having an American pilot. I remember getting involved in that issue and at one
                    point managing to reach the Angolan chief of staff of the armed forces but the
                    Angolans were not going to be cooperative with the UN or the US to permit
                    searches for the downed planes in a combat zone.. At the same time, the US had
                    its last communication with UNITA Commander Jonas Savimbi over that incident. My
                    predecessor had been going for most of the previous three years to periodic UN
                    meetings with Savimbi out in the interior provinces. Savimbi's usual refrain was
                    how his commanders were pushing him to be more and more aggressive, but that he
                    was being patient. From about August '98, neither the UN nor the U.S. had direct
                    communication with Savimbi. Then in December of '1998, Pickering did reach
                    Savimbi on a satellite phone to urge his cooperation in searching for the plane
                    and the lost Americans. Well Savimbi was someone who had charmed both Mao Zedong
                    and Ronald Reagan and he would always say the right things, but generally not do
                    them.</p>
                <p>That was when I began to provide my own analyses as I had been on the ground
                    longer, as I talked to people, heard my own staff directly, some of them very
                    good and persuasive, notably our political officer Alex Laskaris. I reached the
                    conclusion that this was no longer a peace that could be reestablished, it was
                    really not possible to restore the Lusaka Peace Agreement. Savimbi had broken
                    virtually every piece agreement that he had ever entered. We could not expect
                    the government of Angola to listen to us and follow our counsel of restraint
                    because they would always fear, based on their history, that Savimbi would enter
                    a temporary agreement to build his forces back up only to make war again. So I
                    reached the conclusion that we really needed to change our approach. We ought
                    not to be looking to, nor expect to restore the Lusaka Peace Agreement, but
                    instead decide what we needed to do to bring the civil war to a definitive
                    conclusion.</p>
                <p>My conclusion was that Savimbi was an unreliable partner, that he was not
                    interested in peace, but in power. We had no reason to try to restore a place
                    for him in a peace agreement that he had broken. On the other hand, the Angolan
                    government was not a bargain, nothing great, nothing we would think was the
                    greatest in the world but certainly the better of the two alternatives. In
                    addition, that is frankly where our economic interests lay as well, since the
                    Angolan government controlled the area that at that point was producing as much
                    as seven percent of U.S. petroleum imports, much of that extracted by US
                    petroleum companies. I began to put that advice into telegrams and conveying it
                    whenever I met with US policymakers. I must say that for quite a while, that
                    advice was not welcomed and, for the most part, the U.S. essentially took a
                    hands-off posture in the hope that the peace agreement could be restored.</p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>There was no question of our providing either military assistance or military
                    sales to the Angolan government. Nobody expected that was either possible or
                    desirable, and the Angolan government had enough cash to find others who would
                    sell them weapons in any case. I concluded that we should stop seeking to play a
                    neutral role between the two sides and that this would also have benefits in
                    greater ability to influence the Angolan government. About a year and a half
                    later, by the beginning of the year 2000, we had begun to move in a direction
                    where we clearly regarded UNITA as the greater transgressor and stopped seeking
                    to take an even-handed stand between the two parties. At one point Susan Rice,
                    who had visited Angola shortly before I got to post in the fall of '98 and had
                    not been given a meeting with President dos Santos, reflecting his exasperation
                    with the United States at that point, by the summer of 2000, visited again and
                    got a very nice reception. By then, the Angolan government was confident that
                    they would eventually prevail in the civil war. They also had an interest in a
                    good relationship with us and the two governments began to have a more
                    meaningful exchange on a whole range of issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any point when you went to dos Santos and said
                        we are with you or what we were doing or was this all sort of done
                        indirectly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well certainly at the early stage of my tour, all contact was indirect
                    because after presenting my credentials, it was probably a good six months
                    before I got to see the President again. Even our relationships with regular
                    contacts with trusted individuals suffered, it was probably a good six months or
                    so before we began to be able to see those people regularly again. The Angolan
                    armed forces, for instance, had been instructed not to have contact with the
                    Americans even though previously they had a very good working relationship with
                    us. They had been instructed not to have contact with us because they were going
                    to do what they had always done and rely on their own resources, their own
                    people, their own army to eventually prevail. So it was only as they began to
                    regain confidence that they were more open to working with us and others on
                    non-strategic issues. On strategic issues, they found support in various places
                    including Israel, France and Russia to achieve their objectives. The other
                    issues that we had interest in were the humanitarian aspects of the conflict,
                    providing humanitarian assistance to the internally displaced, and our
                    economic/commercial interests in petroleum. Eventually with the conflict
                    deepening in the Congo, Angola came to the assistance of then President Laurent
                    Kabila and so became a party to that conflict. As a result, we had a new set of
                    issues to discuss with respect to the Congo. By then, the US-Angolan
                    relationship had improved sufficiently that we were able to have quite a good
                    and regular communication with a key actor on that issue, the armed forces chief
                    of staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about say the French, the British, Portuguese, the

                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were they doing and what were you doing with
                        them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well we diplomats always meet and talk with each other and the
                    Russians, the Portuguese and us, as guarantors of the Lusaka peace agreement,
                    together with the UN had a regular set of meetings and periodic meetings with
                    the Angolan government. Essentially, the Angolan government didn't want anything
                    serious to do with the Lusaka Peace Process remnants, this troika of three plus
                    the UN. They really just wanted any constraints from that process out of the
                    way. To the degree that they agreed to hold any meetings, they weren't
                    listening; they just wanted UN forces out of the way and the UN not to
                    intervene. Their view was that the conflict would proceed and the Angolan
                    government would eventually prevail and then we could talk again. Everybody had
                    their own means of entr�e. The Russians had a greater, longstanding,
                    military-to-military relationship historically. (President dos Santos had
                    actually studied in the Soviet Union.) The French had a certain relationship
                    with the Angolan intelligence service and helped in certain Angolan arms
                    purchases. The Israelis also provided some important equipment and technical
                    advice. But in terms of strategic influence, the Angolans were doing their own
                    thing and were not going to take counsel from anybody. The more relevant
                    question for them that would occasionally be debated openly by senior Angolans
                    with foreigners was what they should do with Savimbi, if they should capture
                    him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any sort of loose Cubans wandering around at
                        that point or...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: No, not really. No they were pretty much out of it by then. It was a
                    historic relationship and at earlier phases of that war in the '70's and '80s,
                    the Cubans had played a decisive role against South African forces. But by the
                    2000's, the Cubans were not involved in any important way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Israel what were they up to?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Israel was providing important assistance. I don't know if it's ever
                    become public but it was sort of talked about at the time that they were helping
                    them fight more effectively. Israel always has lots of former military and
                    former Mossad and former military officials, who are retired into the military
                    sales business and they were very much around. But, they could not have operated
                    as extensively as they did without the agreement of the Israeli government. I
                    was quite close friends with the Israeli ambassador at the time, who was a
                    former journalist with a lot of African experience, but also with a lot of
                    connections in key military and intelligence positions in Israel. She believed
                    that Israel should assist the Angolan government to prevail as quickly as
                    possible in the internal conflict. So I think that Israel provided some decisive
                    assistance during 2000 and 2001 that helped them prevail.</p>
                <p>By the time I left Angola in the summer of 2001, I had been told that the Angolan
                    government had isolated Savimbi to two areas in the deep, deep countryside and
                    at one point had a Special Forces unit that had to choose between two targets to
                    go after him. They did not choose the right target on that occasion and he
                    escaped, but that only lasted another six months and eventually in February
                    2002, six months after I left Angola, Savimbi was killed in combat in that same
                    remote area of the Angolan countryside.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To get an idea because this obviously was a very
                        complicated area and the role of the Americans was sort of problematic for a
                        good bit of time. How did your embassy operate? I mean political officers,
                        economic officers? How were they getting around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well we had lots of constraints upon us. We were still working out of
                    an embassy made out of prefab buildings that had been put there in 1992 to last
                    just five years. So we worked in pretty cramped and precarious circumstances.
                    Our housing was also quite poor with problematic electricity and water supply.
                    We were right in the heart of the city so we didn't feel under direct threat
                    there but once you left the city of Luanda it became more complicated, and as a
                    result, most of our staff were confined to the city.</p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>Our ability to travel was quite limited. I did travel a fair bit and our AID
                    personnel in particular traveled quite a bit as we monitored humanitarian
                    assistance, usually coordinated by the World Food Program going out to
                    provincial capitals around the country, where the internally displaced civilian
                    population had fled and were living in tent camps. To do that, the U.S. actually
                    paid for the World Food Program to have a small fleet of Beechcraft ten-seaters
                    to take their staff as well as our people out to the field. These planes would
                    have to perform corkscrew landings in and out of the provincial capital to stay
                    within the small perimeter of the city that was secure from surface-to-surface
                    missiles. In late 2000 or early 2001, a UN cargo plane flew too low and took a
                    missile, but somehow managed to survive the hit and land. But after that, the UN
                    reinforced the message to the pilots that they needed to adhere rigorously to
                    the corkscrew landing and takeoff policies. One of those planes with a couple of
                    AID personnel on board, as well as the deputy minister of health, did follow the
                    corkscrew landing policy, but the pilot wasn't used to it, got vertigo and
                    barely managed to land short of the runway, while losing his landing gear and
                    sliding across the runway on the plane's belly. Everybody was shaken up, but
                    nobody was badly injured.</p>
                <p>There were risks as well as problems in our getting out there, getting around and
                    getting personal information for ourselves. For the most part we were reliant on
                    what we heard either through intelligence channels, which was helpful, but not
                    terrific. We were able to eventually establish a fairly good working
                    relationship once again with the Angolan government and the Angolan armed
                    forces. We had a terrific defense attach� who basically kept seeing his old
                    buddies even though they were told not to talk to him, but they did find a way
                    to talk to him. But most of our information was second hand. We didn't get out
                    to the field very much, so we knew what other people told us. We knew what the
                    intelligence channels provided, which was only occasionally good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way you were blessed by the fact that the world media
                        just wasn't paying any attention to this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yes, there were only occasional bursts of attention and more of them
                    probably in Europe than in the United States. The one other big issue that
                    emerged in that time or one of the big issues that emerged was blood
                    diamonds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: The focus on blood diamonds originated because of the conflicts fueled
                    by these diamonds in Sierra Leone and in Angola. The NGO and media focus on the
                    issue coincided with an interest in the Clinton administration of cracking down
                    on this trade. Savimbi had financed many of his arms purchases through diamond
                    mines that he ran himself in territory which the Angolan armed forces didn't
                    control. The major effort to shut down these and other dirty diamonds throughout
                    Africa, eventually, produced some success through the Kimberley process. There
                    is never going to be total success but it was reasonable success, particularly
                    when one thinks that “De Beers” and Maurice Tempelsman judged at the beginning
                    that there is no way an effort to shut off blood diamond can succeed. De Beers
                    always had taken the position that it needed to buy up any loose diamonds from
                    anywhere and hold them off the market in order to keep diamond prices up. Well
                    the result of that De Beers practice, of course, was that anybody like Savimbi
                    who had the diamonds could get a substantial price for them and then use those
                    proceeds for arms. De Beers actually ended its policy of buying up loose
                    diamonds of unknown provenance which helped the campaign against blood
                    diamonds..</p>
                <p>The US was also engaged deeply in and continued to be engaged throughout the war
                    in the effort to remove land mines which endangered the civilian population.
                    Because there were always areas that were more secure than others we were able
                    to continue some landmine removal in selected areas throughout the last phase of
                    the war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the South African government now under, this would
                        have been...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: President Mbeki most of that period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they play any role or were they out of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Their role was limited because neither the Angolan government nor the
                    South African government trusted each other. Mbeki had a brother who died in
                    Angola during the period of apartheid government in which he was affiliated with
                    the external fighters of the South African current ruling party. That is assumed
                    to be one of the reasons for Mbeki's suspicions of the Angolan government for
                    having permitted this to happen. In any case, the Angolans have ample paranoia
                    of their own and many Angolans feared that South Africa was seeking to insure
                    that Angola, relatively rich and large country, would stay divided and never
                    challenge South Africa for supremacy in southern Africa. Looking at the relative
                    GDP's of the two countries makes that thesis appear ludicrous, but Angolan
                    government ministers would voice it to me. That probably limited South Africa's
                    potential role, as well as their belief, likely correct, that Mbeki was
                    maintaining contact with Savimbi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. What about the Congo? It was falling apart wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Sure, that was when the phrase the first African World War was coined.
                    There were something like eleven different countries in Africa involved in that
                    war. The Angolan government was one and the principal instigators from outside
                    were Rwanda and Uganda, which had helped install Congolese President Laurent
                    Kabila in 1997, turned against him in 1998 and sent troops and elements in to
                    try to topple Laurent Desire Kabila, the father of the current president. At
                    that point a number of countries in the region chose sides and the Angolans
                    chose the side of Kabila. Why? I guess even though they had been involved
                    originally with Rwanda in the original overthrow of Mobutu and the installation
                    of Laurent Kabila, they decided that this latest effort could jeopardize their
                    interests. Most importantly, the Angolans had a reasonable relationship with
                    Kabila and feared that Savimbi might be able to establish a relationship with
                    whomever succeed him of the sort he had had with Mobutu. So the Angolans sent in
                    forces to defend the Kabila government and to provide security for him together
                    with Zimbabwean forces. I engaged most closely with the Angolans on Congo from
                    January, 2001, after the assassination of Congolese President Laurent Kabila by
                    his bodyguard and the assumption of the presidency by his son Joseph Kabila. The
                    Angolans were advising Joseph Kabila in restoring stability to some effect,
                    although they always felt the Congolese armed forces were very ineffective
                    compared to their own and basically incapable of being trained well.</p>
                <p>One other thing that was interesting in the light of Ambassador Holbrook's recent
                    passing is that Holbrook as the US permanent representative to the United
                    Nations began to take a great interest in Africa. He decided that while the
                    United States was the president of the Security Council, if I recall correctly,
                    it would have been about February 2000, the United States would organize a UN
                    conference to deal with the conflict in the Congo and invite all the key
                    presidents from Africa to come. I must say that initially this sounded to me and
                    many others like an idea that couldn't succeed, particularly because the Angolan
                    president hated to travel and found excuses not to travel all the time. Yet,
                    Holbrook was determined and he pursued his objectively relentlessly and
                    eventually succeeded in pulling it off. He got dos Santos to travel to New York
                    as well as Laurent Kabila and about four other presidents most involved in the
                    Congolese conflict. The purpose, even if it was not articulated as such, was to
                    give Laurent Kabila an opportunity to recover his image, reestablish his
                    authority and utilize the standing of the United Nations to resist those forces
                    seeking his overthrow. Laurent Kabila frankly was incapable of taking advantage
                    of the opportunity presented. He was very erratic, a very poor leader, and
                    missed his opportunity and was eventually assassinated and succeeded by his son
                    Joseph who has done a somewhat better job than his father.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, because in earlier years there were all these
                        attempts to separate Katanga. Was there anything the Shaba invasions, was
                        there anything going on there or did that movement sort of die out?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I think the Katanga thing was over but what the Rwandans did was take
                    advantage to exploit mineral resources in the eastern Congo. This would have
                    been areas near Goma, much closer to Rwanda than to the Congolese capital of
                    Kinshasa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: So Rwanda was clearly exploiting those resources during the period
                    where they had troops in Congo and the Rwandans also were pursuing their
                    security interests due to the presence of Hutu forces, which had fled to the
                    Congo after the 1994 Rwandan conflict. Now sixteen years, later the Hutu forces
                    in eastern Congo are more likely to be the children of the original fighters
                    than they are the 1994 fighters themselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the other former Portugal territory Mozambique?
                        At that point was there any connection or play any role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Not really other than that Mozambique from Angola's point of view could
                    always be counted on as a solid ally within the SADC, the South African
                    Development Community, because the ruling party of Mozambique, FRELIMO, and the
                    MPLA had been sister parties within the Socialist camp during the liberation
                    struggle and the Cold War and had both resisted both South African and other
                    Western interference in their takeover from the Portuguese. Mozambique was more
                    democratic and more peaceful than Angola. But the historical connection made
                    Mozambique a reliable ally for Angola.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of relations how would you describe your
                        relations with Washington? I mean you had Susan Rice was a person who had
                        rather, from what I gather, strong opinions about this. How did you find
                        working with her and with the rest of the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yeah, well with Susan, as you say, had very strong opinions and she had
                    strong reservations towards the Angolan government. I don't think she had any
                    particular nostalgia for UNITA, as some people with a CIA background had. But
                    she did not have good feelings towards the Angolan government, which had plenty
                    of negatives in its tolerance of corruption and failure to improve the lot of
                    its own people. So when I began to formulate my independent views and send them
                    in, my views and recommendations were not very welcome. Susan and I didn't argue
                    and we dealt with each other respectfully, but my recommendations went into a
                    void and didn't succeed in affecting U.S. policy other than at the margins. It
                    was possible to get a few things going but most of what I was able to do was
                    done on our own hook. The embassy gradually cultivated improved relations with
                    the Angolan government so we began to have some influence on some matters of
                    interest to us and also to gain some insight into what the Angolans were doing.
                    I think Susan only became more open to working toward improving relations with
                    the Angolan government a year or more later. In late 2000 or early 2001, Susan
                    led an interagency team that was ready to establish the relationship on a much
                    more cooperative basis on a whole range of fronts, on humanitarian assistance,
                    on economic and trade issues. This led to various working groups and we worked
                    well together during that visit. Susan is somebody who has an inner circle and I
                    was never part of Susan's inner circle, but we found ways to work together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From what I gather dos Santos was again every individual.
                        I mean here he was a leader but he had pretty much a tight group around him
                        and he didn't really accept outside influences say from an embassy in
                        Washington and all would have very little sway with him anyway.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I guess so, yes, particularly when it came to strategic issues where he
                    was going to decided what needed to be done and do it. From his point of view he
                    had probably allowed himself to be overly influenced by international concerns
                    during the four years of the Lusaka Peace Process to the extent that he didn't
                    “take care of the problem himself” by going in there and disarming UNITA. He
                    listened to the outside counsel that he should be restrained and then wound up
                    with a situation that was quite precarious. The Angolan forces captured a famous
                    tape of Savimbi telling his UNITA sub commanders in 1998 to leave their women
                    and children behind because the women in Luanda are bathing in preparation for
                    your arrival. So there was no question that in the period before the war began
                    again in late 1998 that Savimbi intended to capture the capital of power.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yeah, I didn't have that degree of problem but I must say we had a
                    minimal presence and almost no relationships and I would have been interested in
                    encouraging a better bilateral relationship on that side. It was bad
                    historically because we had been supporters of their enemy, and particularly the
                    agency was perceived as the great supporters of their enemy. It was very tough
                    sledding and I got along mostly with the agency, but I think there were
                    occasional reappearances of nostalgia for the past in which the agency had a
                    more important role in Angola. So to the degree that I engaged with the agency
                    in a conflictive way, it was mostly to make sure that nostalgia for the past not
                    prevail.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How Marxist was the Angolan government by the time you got
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Barely, mostly in name only, and only to the degree that there were
                    certain economic policies of state interventionism that were remnants of the
                    past. I think the government at that point was more interested in controlling
                    large economic sectors, such as petroleum and mining, not for ideological
                    reasons, but because that was where the money and control of power rested.
                    President dos Santos had over the years gathered more power into his own inner
                    circle at the expense of the traditional Marxist party, the MPLA. To a certain
                    degree, this was to make sure that he controlled the resources, but also because
                    control of economic resources means control of power.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any sort of roving Americans who were coming
                        over to either look for roots or trying to see a real Marxist country? Did
                        you run across oddballs like this I'm speaking as a former consular
                        officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I don't mean to be totally facetious but I think that a side benefits
                    of a civil war is that it tends to keep out that brand of traveler. It was a
                    dangerous place and you could get shot out there pretty easily. One of the major
                    functions that we had was both consulting with the oil companies over their own
                    security; particularly the American companies but also with the humanitarian
                    groups. Our security people worked with the oil companies and the UN and the
                    NGO's all the time and exchanged information on where the greatest threats might
                    be. There were a lot of risks out there, so people with their own agenda, were
                    probably limited to the humanitarian organizations, the World Vision, the
                    Doctors Without Borders and the other NGOs whose laudable humanitarian agendas
                    would occasionally drift over into a more political area where they would push
                    for new negotiations or for humanitarian corridors to deliver assistance.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the oil companies because in some places I
                        think it is in Nigeria where you have the local people who are trying to get
                        a piece of the action. What was happening with the oil companies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Ironically, Angola was never and is not today anything as tumultuous as
                    Nigeria is. I had a friend who was with Halliburton at the time who had gone up
                    and taken a posting in Nigeria and after a year they was asked, “Would you like
                    to come back to Angola?” He said, “Please, please, please. Let me come.” By
                    contrast for one thing the overwhelmingly large percentage of Angolan production
                    was offshore and some of it was in ultra-deep waters way offshore. So I think
                    only way back in the 1992 phase of the conflict did someone on those platforms
                    have shells going by them and have to evacuate by boat. But for the most part
                    UNITA never got close to the ocean; local people were not organized enough to
                    cause problems and government security was good enough. You may recall that at
                    an earlier phase of that war in the 1970's, the Cubans had actually helped
                    provide security for what was then Gulf Oil production offshore. Now, without
                    the Cubans the Angolans were able to provide protection themselves and the fact
                    that the conflict was overwhelmingly inland was also a great help. So no, they
                    didn't have those security problems.</p>
                <p>That said there were a lot of interesting issues with the oil companies. Chevron,
                    at that stage had Condoleezza Rice on its board of directors, back before she
                    came back into government. Certainly Chevron was anxious to influence the U.S.
                    government as well as influence the Angolan government. Chevron was very
                    interested in renewing their lease on the petroleum exploration blocs off the
                    coast of Cabinda as well as their operating base on land in Cabinda. The
                    Angolans never threatened Chevron with not renewing, but moved slowly to
                    formalize the renewal, probably to get as much out of the renewal as possible
                    and probably as well, to make sure that Chevron got nervous and worked to
                    improve US-Angolan government relations. Exxon also got into the bidding while I
                    was there; bid on and won several promising blocs of ultra-deep offshore
                    production so that Exxon-Mobil became a significant player alongside
                    Chevron-Texaco, BP and Total.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: African governments have the reputation of taking the
                        money from natural resources Nigeria certainly has that and it disappears
                        into Swiss banks. How about Angola, what was happening there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I think there has always been a good deal of corruption in Angola. But
                    I am convinced that the most destructive effects are caused by civil wars and
                    Angola's civil war had lasted for at least 27 years with a few interruptions
                    with a tremendously destructive effect on the civilian population, on national
                    production and everything else. In the years since the war ended in 2002, Angola
                    has been growing at the 10-14 percent rate. I'm sure a fair bit of that money
                    has gone missing, but growth of 10-14 percent means that many people are
                    benefiting a great deal. So Angola is in a lot better shape and while I haven't
                    been back since 2001, everybody tells me that it is much better. The questions I
                    have are if the government is investing the money in the poorest people? Are
                    they improving what was always a terrible, abominable education system, one that
                    was bequeathed to them by their Portuguese colonialists who didn't educate the
                    Portuguese who were there well, much less the Africans. So Angola had never
                    developed a decent education system. The health system was always chaotic and
                    then had been through thirty years of war. So Angola has a tremendous way to go
                    in education and health and in providing basic benefits of their population. I
                    hope but don't know that they have used a substantial portion of that 10-14
                    percent of growth to do that.</p>

                        the 7th of February 2011 with Joe Sullivan. Joe, we are off to
                        Zimbabwe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yeah, as often happens on these things I did a little bit of reflection
                    and thought I would start off with perhaps five minutes of things that I should
                    cover on Angola before we move on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh good, oh sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Okay, with respect to Angola, one thing you asked that I didn't
                    adequately answer was how was the situation for our people in the embassy? I did
                    note that there were only a few explicit security risks that we faced but the
                    precautions we took were great and, in effect, inhibited us from in most
                    instances leaving the capital city. Beyond that because of our late start in
                    Angola, only establishing an embassy in 1992, the tremendous cost of property
                    there because of the presence of oil companies meant that we were living in a
                    very poor set of houses and apartments throughout the city. So as I mentioned
                    before, the embassy was operating out of a set of temporary buildings that had
                    been put in in '92 and had long outlived their five-year expected shelf life and
                    provided minimal standards for what had grown to an embassy presence of around
                    30 people. Our staff had a bad office to work in and bad homes to live in. Even
                    the Ambassador's residence, while I don't really have a personal complaint, was
                    about the smallest of ambassador's houses one could ever see. I had basically
                    one bedroom and a maid's room that was it. So when Tom Pickering came and
                    stayed, I wound up staying in the living room and Tom stayed in my bedroom; that
                    was it.</p>
                <p>We had a situation that was for our people difficult at best. Most people
                    soldiered on. There were a few people who were unhappy people and were very
                    vocal about it so morale was a constant concern. I tried to be very sensitive to
                    the fact that people were living and working in bad conditions. There wasn't
                    much to do in Angola and even in Luanda because things were highly priced; it
                    was difficult to get around; there weren't very many good restaurants to go to,
                    you could go to the beach on the weekends but that was really about it. I felt
                    that Washington, at times, was not very sensitive to us on this subject. We did
                    seek to upgrade our temporary office building, while we waited on decisions on
                    construction of a new embassy chancery. In addition to the main embassy
                    structure, which was a pre-fabricated temporary building, we had a small set of
                    rented offices with the consular and USIS functions down the hill closer to the
                    water and those were also very inadequate. When we sought to move our consular
                    functions into a newly built office building downtown, we faced the usual
                    dilemma that if you change from one currently unsecure structure to another that
                    is more secure, the decision from diplomatic security is no, you can't move to
                    this new structure because it's not as secure as we insist any newly occupied
                    structure to be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you stayed in the one that is less secure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: God.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Then, we had special problems in Luanda recruiting staff. Over the
                    course of a career, one builds up a set of contacts; people we think are very
                    good, who would fit in very well, but then you go give them a call and you say,
                    “You know why don't you consider coming out here, we have a nice challenging job
                    for you.” At the end of the day, the people one contacts would have heard enough
                    bad things about Angola and they have good reasons, school-age kids or a spouse
                    not interested in coming. We had a restriction on school-age children at post
                    and that was one of the factors that posed great difficulties in recruiting
                    staff. Those things only began to improved after the war ended. I should add as
                    well that in the Clinton administration, there was an undersecretary for
                    management, who believed that maybe we should just shut down in Angola because
                    it faced security problems and rather than building a new chancery, which was
                    being discussed at the time, maybe we should just pull the plug and close the
                    mission. I think that was not a very considered judgment, because the US had and
                    continues to have major interests there, notably petroleum and other natural
                    resources. I could not imagine that we really would decide to close the US
                    mission, but I do think that the Under Secretary's own doubts about the wisdom
                    of maintaining a presence contributed to slowing down US decision-making on new
                    embassy construction for several years. It was only after General Williams
                    became Office of Overseas Building Director in 2001 that decisions were made,
                    funding found and construction of a new embassy building completed in about
                    2004.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the local employees, the Angolans who work for
                        the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well you know they faced their own challenges daily. For the most part
                    they felt like they had a good job working for the embassy. They were more
                    content there than they would be elsewhere. They tended to come from better
                    educated elements in the population. We did struggle at times to make sure we
                    paid them adequately given the chaotic nature of the war economy. In fact, we
                    were authorized to pay them in dollars and we used to have to fly them into the
                    country. We also had several key third-country national employees, mostly
                    Portuguese, whom I knew from my time in Lisbon 20 years before.</p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>I was going to move to a slightly different theme also on Angola and that refers
                    to your earlier question regarding the quality of the information we had on
                    Angola. I said, “We managed to get some decent information from the government
                    and from the armed forces, notwithstanding the obstacles put in our way.” But
                    one of the inevitable effects of the fact that we could gather information on
                    the Angolan government, but had little good information on UNITA was that we
                    received information about Angolan military and government inefficiencies and
                    corruption in purchasing, about phantom military units in which senior officers
                    collected the pay of some of the supposed members of that unit,
                    dysfunctionalities in getting people out to the field and other problems. All of
                    those things were true, but the fact is we had very little information on the
                    other side meant that we did not learn of the problems that UNITA was facing.
                    Most of the information we got on UNITA was what UNITA was telling their allies
                    or their potential supporters on the outside and they never talked about their
                    problems. They talked about how well they were doing, how good the unit cohesion
                    was, etc. It was a distorted picture, I think, and sometimes resulted in
                    distorted analysis. I recall in particular INR having a view that UNITA's
                    victory would be inevitable due to their advantages, a strong leader in Savimbi,
                    and lots of problems on the government side. I think there was mixed into that
                    was some degree of positive past experience with Savimbi and UNITA which colored
                    judgments and the Embassy wound up having a cable dispute with the INR analysis
                    to try and correct the record and make sure that consumers in Washington were
                    not affected by this faulty analysis. So these were some of the issues we faced
                    that I neglected to cover last time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your relationship with the oil companies? Were
                        they welcoming you or were they...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yes, they were good and particularly the American ones looked to us for
                    help. Chevron in the case had had a long-term lease on their principal holdings
                    off-shore in Cabinda and were looking to extend it so they consulted us
                    regularly on that and asked us to weigh in which we did both at the embassy and
                    when there would be visits in Washington. We would encourage the Angolan
                    government as well to look favorably on that application. Exxon as well sought
                    our assistance for periodic bids for offshore oil blocks. Now on those I think
                    our ability to actually influence these bids was very limited. The blocs were
                    offered in return for very high cash bonuses and the high bidder tended to get
                    it and American companies really did pretty well. Exxon got a couple of major
                    blocs in the period that I was there; but there were other issues. Exxon had
                    issues of extraction and how it should be done and so on that would come up and
                    we would be asked to weigh in on those issues. For the others, BP because it was
                    BP- Amoco, having absorbed a former American company and as they used to say,
                    with an American majority of share holders, consulted us fairly frequently; less
                    so the French companies ELF and later TOTAL; but we had what information we
                    needed from them. I'm sure they looked more closely to the French embassy for
                    support. And we shared our security perspectives with all the oil companies.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you and your embassy go down to the oil bar or club
                        or anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Sure and occasionally we did. Our economic officer had had prior
                    training before coming to post as petroleum officer and she kept particularly
                    close contact with the “Oilies,” as they called themselves, in order to get a
                    pulse on what they were up to and the problems they faced. So I think we were in
                    pretty good touch. I want to reflect as well on the marked change between the
                    Clinton and the Bush administrations with respect to petroleum policy. The
                    Clinton administration had apparently concluded that because oil prices were at
                    the time relatively low, the U.S. should not concern itself overly about opening
                    new sources for oil imports to the U.S. At least, that was the policy direction
                    we felt in the embassy. The Bush administration, on the other hand, with its
                    Texas oil connections transmitted sharply different conclusions. That said, I
                    think the embassy took a fairly consistent line throughout.</p>
                <p>I'll give you one example of how this played out in the Clinton administration.
                    One of the things that was important for me and some other people in the embassy
                    to do was to visit Cabinda, which was an enclave actually surrounded by the
                    Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo and separated from the
                    Angolan mainland. That was where Chevron had its main onshore operating base so
                    it was important for us to go up periodically, show the flag, talk to the people
                    up there as well as to local officials in Cabinda province. Yet the only way to
                    get there was by taking a Chevron plane. We had to obtain approval to take a
                    private commercial plane and this would require a message back to the legal
                    adviser's office and approval was often very, very slow in coming. At times I
                    even had to delay the trip in order to get that approval. I guess there was fear
                    of criticism that we were accepting benefits from a private company, but there
                    was no other way to go. It wasn't a luxury trip or anything. I may have spent
                    one or two overnights up there in the total of three years and those were
                    essentially lodging in company barracks on the Chevron base. It was just doing
                    our job but it was difficult sometimes doing our job because it wasn't given a
                    high priority in the Clinton State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then you are off to Zimbabwe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Exactly, yep.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I think October of 2001 until about August of 2004.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now whom did you know that was handing out these
                        choice assignments? I mean obviously you were living in sort of luxury on
                        fun places, nice people, Mugabe and all.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well Zimbabwe used to be considered a luxury
                    post...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: For one of the first times in its history, Zimbabwe actually had a
                    political appointee as ambassador by the Clinton administration prior to me. Now
                    he was somebody, who when the Bush administration came in, who resigned his
                    position. Yet the post was considered sufficiently delicate and important at the
                    time that the department sent out several senior former ambassadors out there to
                    hold the fort until a permanent ambassador could get there; that always takes
                    time. So I was nominated probably about April or May and got through the
                    nomination process, I think, in maybe August, but that was par for the course;
                    it wasn't a particularly problematic thing. I welcomed it; it was going to be an
                    interesting assignment. I'm not sure frankly if the Democratic Party had won the
                    2000 election whether I would have gotten that assignment. I think there was
                    some inclination to send another political appointee and yet when Gore lost the
                    election, it was a relatively amicable transition at least on the Africa side
                    and probably as well in the undersecretary's office side. So at that point I was
                    told how about you going there and I said, “Fine.” Yeah, I guess it would be
                    considered to be a booby prize by some but I would rather be busy and in this
                    case Zimbabwe remained a beautiful country and it was just a very problematic
                    period to be there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation when you went there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: When I went, they were gearing up to presidential elections which had
                    been scheduled for March of 2002. For the first time in his life, certainly in
                    his presidency, Mugabe faced a serious political challenge to his continued
                    rule. Mugabe had already begun a couple years before that this policy of
                    deliberate land invasions particularly land owned by Whites as a political
                    tactic to seek to gather support from the population. The Opposition had
                    gradually built up itself and there was a lot of, I think, popular wish to get
                    Mugabe out.</p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>The economy had been in decline since the early '90s and people were anxious for
                    change. Civil society had grown significantly and the U.S. had been supportive
                    of that. We had a number of AID programs that were supportive of civil society,
                    so, to a certain degree, the U.S. was considered the enemy by Mugabe and his
                    ruling ZANU- PF government. That said, we had a moderate degree of ability to do
                    our job and one of the challenges we faced was that we had something of a
                    multi-headed operation without very much coordination. So one of my challenges
                    there was to make sure we were all working together and communicating with each
                    other, particularly in the build up to the election. I worked very hard on that
                    and even though nobody likes meetings; in that crisis situation, we were holding
                    meetings virtually every day to make sure we were all coordinated among the
                    major agencies and players at the mission including the USAID component; which
                    as I said, was very heavily involved in democracy building efforts.</p>
                <p>Prior to my arrival at post, bipartisan legislation, called the Zimbabwe
                    Democracy and Economic Recovery Act had been passed by the Congress in
                    coordination with the Bush Administration and with the support of the black
                    caucus. The legislation contained incentives to the government of Zimbabwe to
                    hold free and fair elections, but also a number of sticks that would be used if
                    there was interference in that process. The bipartisan US position toward
                    Zimbabwe was a principal focus of the confirmation hearings that I had going out
                    to post, which were very amicable compared to the previous hearings I had had
                    for the Angola appointment.</p>
                <p>So going out to post, U.S. policy was fairly clear and the policy instruments
                    were clearer than they had been in the past. What was not as clear was our
                    ability to achieve our policy objectives and how the Mugabe government would
                    react to the conditions explicit in US legislation and policy. The Mugabe
                    government apparently assessed that if they did hold fair and open elections,
                    Mugabe stood a very good chance of losing those elections. In the typical call
                    one makes on President Mugabe after presenting credentials, there was quite a
                    bit of talking past each other. I was encouraging him to hold those elections
                    openly to allow international observers freely, to allow domestic observers to
                    be independent to do their job. Mugabe was going back and recounting his version
                    of history; the history of coming to power in 1980 and his recollection of the
                    British role in which he always believes conservative British governments were
                    better from his perspective notwithstanding his own Socialist past. In any case,
                    he really wasn't listening very much and I got no confidence that we would have
                    much of a positive collaboration with the government. Sure enough, he
                    effectively prevented observers from the Republican and Democratic Institutes
                    from sending election observers. As the election approached, the government and
                    election authorities began to put obstacles began to be put in the way of the
                    opposition and in the way of election observer missions. The European Union
                    eventually withdrew its observer mission due to obstacles placed in the way of
                    its activities. There was significant violence against opposition organizers and
                    a good degree of obfuscation in the cities where ZANU PF felt itself
                    particularly vulnerable. The government deliberately slowed down the voting
                    process in the cities so that many people, mostly opposition supporters, were
                    not able to vote. In rural areas, where ZANU-PF could control the process,
                    ballot boxes were clearly stuffed and we were able to document this.</p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>We, as an embassy, built up our own major observation effort and my deputy Bob
                    Whitehead, who deserves the credit for this, organized and came up with the plan
                    whereby we dispatched around 40 people from all around the mission and filled
                    behind them at the embassy by securing volunteers, mostly from elsewhere in
                    Africa. We did this so that our observers in the field would have the proper
                    diplomatic carnet, should they be harassed, while out doing the observer
                    mission. We succeeded in gathering pretty good information from our observers
                    which enabled us to reach quite solid conclusions about the conduct of the
                    elections. One of our observer groups did get detained by local police for three
                    or four hours until we could raise enough Cain to get them released. No embassy
                    employees came to harm, although a number of Zimbabweans linked to the
                    opposition were beaten badly and those trying to carry out independent
                    observation efforts were also mightily harassed. We concluded that the
                    opposition would have won a free and fair election, but that the election had
                    not been held freely and fairly resulting in Mugabe's election. In addition to
                    our observation, we had other information that the Zimbabwean government had
                    deliberately manipulated the election and stuffed or altered sufficient election
                    results to assure that Mugabe would win the electoral commission's official
                    count. That, notwithstanding, the South Africans had their own election observer
                    mission and they concluded, I think, with not a lot of credibility the election
                    was fair enough to merit recognition and Mugabe took office.</p>
                <p>We began even before the election to implement some of the penalties called for
                    in the Zimbabwe Democracy Act. Most of those penalties were targeted at
                    individuals, removing and canceling their visas, their ability to travel to the
                    United States. We coordinated with the European Union and later with Australia
                    and other countries and they began to implement similar polices. Zimbabwean
                    authorities were certainly upset at these and then some financial restrictions
                    as well as their ability to hold accounts in our countries, but at the end of
                    the day, these measures did not affect the behavior of Mugabe, who was above
                    all, and remains today determined to hold onto power at all costs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you went out there were you getting psychological
                        profiles or had you been in Africa long enough to get a feel for this. I
                        mean this is a very common trait, look at Mubarak today people don't give up
                        power and privilege easily.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Right. I remember actually coming back and meeting with Colin Powell
                    one time and he was quite convinced and correctly so that people like Mugabe
                    “don't get off the back of the tiger; the tiger will eat them.” I only had three
                    or so years in Africa, but many of my staff had been there much longer and they
                    saw these traits and the outcome might be predictable, but the question was “can
                    we influence it in anyway”; we certainly sought to, as did other international
                    players. I think probably the most effective international players, and we
                    recognize this, would have been other Africans but the majority of other African
                    players, and certainly the key other African player from Zimbabwe's point of
                    view, South Africa, declined to stand up. Some of it was Mbeki himself and South
                    Africa's feeling that its own coming to majority rule was assisted substantially
                    by Zimbabwe and Mugabe himself once he became president in 1980. Some part of it
                    also was that Mugabe was considered a father figure, a senior independence
                    revolutionary leader, by many Africans and, therefore, one who should be allowed
                    to continue on and not challenged frontally. I think that was a major obstacle
                    that we ever succeeded in overcoming.</p>
                <p>I actually recall a visit to South Africa in 2003 by President George W. Bush,
                    accompanied by Secretary Condoleezza Rice and they having after a meeting with
                    South African President Thabo Mbeki announcing that they would look to him to
                    provide the solution for Zimbabwe. Well, okay, except he was not going to really
                    provide the solution for Zimbabwe because he was never going to ever challenge
                    Mugabe. In addition to the other reasons I mentioned, Mbeki harbored some degree
                    of anti-Western sentiments that led him to believe that if the opposition figure
                    Tsvangirai and his party were supported by the West, then that made them
                    illegitimate.</p>
                <p>The other feature perhaps I should talk about is the economy. The economy, of
                    course, continued to decline sharply and had major effects on the population
                    leading by the time I left Zimbabwe to the emigration of about 25 percent of the
                    population.</p>

                <p>SULLIVAN: The majority to South Africa, others to Australia and others to England
                    in order then to earn money to be able to send back to feed their families. So
                    it's not a mystery, but it's a terrible tragedy and in some ways the greatest
                    failure that a leader can be to their own people, that they force people to
                    emigrate in order to survive; that's what wound up happening. To Mugabe, this
                    was almost irrelevant; the important thing to him was holding power himself and
                    there could be no Zimbabwe without him in his view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How stood things from the bleachers? I read in the papers
                        about the White farmers being forced out and all. How stood the situation by
                        the time you got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well by the time I got there the majority of white farmers had been
                    forced out. There were still individual cases in the process of being forced out
                    and by now it must be 99 percent of them that have been forced out. I think
                    there is an argument to be made that many of these white farmers had ignored the
                    potential for problems in the future, particularly if they had bought the land
                    since 1980. Since Mugabe came to power, it was necessary to obtain a certificate
                    of no interest by the state in order to purchase the land and in almost all
                    cases they got that. But that certificate did not protect them against Mugabe
                    changing his mind and changing the courts as much as he needed in order to have
                    his decision to take white farmers' lands upheld. But it is also true that a
                    situation in which something like 20 percent of the most productive land being
                    held by Whites in a country in which Whites were perhaps less than one percent
                    of the population this was a future problem. The white farmers probably didn't
                    anticipate the potential problem very well. At least some of them had supported
                    Mugabe with contributions to his favored causes, even political contributions to
                    him. He also wanted them to stay out of politics, which for the most part they
                    did. But at the end of the day, they were there when he needed a political
                    cause, when he had already suffered one electoral defeat in a constitutional
                    referendum and he made his political cause seizing the land of the White
                    farmers, which won him some support among black Zimbabweans and other black
                    Africans. By 2002, I am convinced that the majority of the population no longer
                    supported him, but the land issue had become his political banner.</p>
                <p>Fortunately, I think, none of the white farmers had American citizenship so the
                    US had no direct espousal responsibility, as did many of my colleagues from the
                    British embassy and many other Europeans. These embassies espoused the cases of
                    their citizens and it occupied a great deal of their time with almost no effect
                    really. The diplomatic advocacy might have been able to slow down the process,
                    but was almost never able to prevent the government from not only seizing their
                    property but in many cases the farm equipment on their property as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were these farms taken over by essentially dispossessed
                        people who just sat there or were they taken over by natives of the country
                        who were getting something out of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I'll go back a little bit to say that the Zimbabwean government had had
                    a program of nationalization of property for benefit of black Zimbabweans and
                    the British government to a small degree contributed to that and the
                    international community also assisted. One of the reasons the international
                    community didn't play a larger role in that program was that previously
                    expropriated land had wound up going in many cases to cronies of Mugabe. Some
                    land did go to blacks in communally owned lands, but these lands were typically
                    not given sufficient resources or agricultural extension support to do much
                    effective raising of crops and the additional land was devoted largely
                    subsistence agriculture. Then what happened in the late '90s but certainly
                    continued throughout my time there, was that the land that was taken was
                    overwhelmingly given to cronies of Mugabe, army officers, later even army
                    enlisted people, senior police and others to buy their loyalty. The majority of
                    these people weren't farmers themselves, they had come from a different
                    background. Many of them were urban people looking to have a stake hold out in
                    the countryside but they didn't have the background and in most cases the
                    resources that they were willing and able to put into the land to make it
                    successful. The white farmers were universally recognized as highly efficient
                    farmers of both wheat, maize, tobacco and other products and they had wound up
                    being replaced by people who by and large farmed the land very unproductively.
                    Consequently, the ability of Zimbabwe to feed its own people declined
                    dramatically. Their ability to produce crops like tobacco for export to raise
                    foreign exchange declined dramatically and you wound up with people who held the
                    land not making efficient farm use of the land.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they sort of letting it out to other people and
                        sitting back and reaping whatever profits came out of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Not for the most part. For the most part they'd go out and visit their
                    farm on the weekend so it was a tragedy in many senses. For the most part the
                    white farmers had been apolitical and in most cases the land holdings were not
                    huge; we are talking a hundred or a couple of hundred acres. But they were very
                    efficient in what they did. Instead those couple of hundred acres began to be
                    almost totally unproductive. Zimbabwe used to be a bread basket of southern
                    Africa and it no longer raised enough grain to feed its own people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did it feed its own people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well a lot of it with international assistance. The World Food Program
                    set up a major program to assist people and the US contributed, as did most
                    western governments, to those feeding programs and they helped many millions of
                    Zimbabweans survive, which caused ambivalent feelings on the government's part.
                    Nonetheless, the government mostly cooperated.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well in a way they were coming out ahead they were sitting
                        back and relaxing and letting the White folk take care of them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Sure, yeah to a certain degree. I mean they didn't like it in the sense
                    that at the World Food Program food distributions, the local party leaders were
                    not allowed to organize the ZANU- PF Party songs since it was supposed to be a
                    non-partisan distribution. So things like that would irritate the government and
                    cause conflict, but eventually, as you say, they needed the food, so for the
                    most part they allowed it to happen. However, on the eve of the March 2002
                    election, the government shut down the food distribution for several weeks
                    because they feared that somehow it could be used politically in a way that was
                    not under their control.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of I won't say instructions but you must have
                        had very mixed reaction in Washington of people saying well screw them let's
                        not do this or you've got to bear down on it or you have to feed the people.
                        It must have been a very difficult position for you to be in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well I think in that case actually there wasn't much disagreement,
                    there wasn't a strong argument that we should not help feed hungry people most
                    of whom were, as they usually are, women and children, many of whom would
                    otherwise have starved or been malnourished; so that wasn't a real argument
                    within the US Government. As I reflect back on what was the greatest
                    disagreement between Washington and the field, it was the belief in Washington
                    that U.S. actions and U.S. punitive actions, in particular, can achieve a
                    political objective. We did not argue against US sanctions against Zimbabwean
                    leaders, but we argued for facing the likely reality that suspension of US visas
                    or financial accounts in the US of individuals in the Zimbabwean regime was not
                    going to be sufficient to force Mugabe to give up power. Mugabe's interests were
                    so strong that he would not hesitate in removing anyone who disagreed with him
                    from their position. He just steamrolled all opposition and that was the way it
                    was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The obvious thing would be and I mean I don't know if you
                        can even comment on it was the sitting around waiting for somebody to kill
                        Mugabe.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: As is often the case in regimes like that, the most efficient operation
                    that the State runs is its own security operations. Within ZANU-PF, loyalty to
                    Mugabe was ambivalent loyalty at a certain point; there were a few people who
                    broke with him but not many. So it was that inner circle that controlled the
                    security forces, that inner circle that controlled access to Mugabe and there is
                    a long debate about Mugabe and how much he'd changed and how much he was always
                    this way, because in the independence struggle and afterwards, he was ruthless
                    at a number of times; effectively ruthless. It can be argued that's the way a
                    guerrilla leader has to be if he is going to succeed, but Mugabe conducted
                    reprisals against black civilian populations that didn't support him and forced
                    them to support him. After coming to power, Mugabe also conducted a major
                    military campaign in Joshua Nkomo's stronghold of Matabeleland and reduced Nkomo
                    from being a figure with his own following to being a powerless, nominal vice
                    president to Mugabe. So Mugabe had a long history of ruthlessness but because he
                    had been what relatively amicable to the West, because he had allowed white
                    farmers to stay on the land and talked about reconciliation I think there was
                    some hope in the West that prevailed in the end that this was somebody you could
                    work with. He used to win his elections with typically 95 percent support and
                    that probably was relatively authentic because there was no significant
                    opposition once he had eliminated Nkomo's political base. But then once he faced
                    a significant political challenge in the late 1990s he became ruthless again
                    with that opposition, including with some of the civil society people that he
                    used to have good relations with.</p>
                <p>I can recall one very good illustrative story of Mugabe who prides himself on
                    having, I think, seven doctoral degrees; some of them are probably not much
                    better than those off a cereal box, but some of them authentic and some of them
                    achieved while he was in jail. In Zimbabwe and, I think, Zambia and a couple
                    other countries the president of the country is often times the chancellor of
                    virtually all the universities of the country and certainly all the state
                    universities; Mugabe took that role with some pride. I became good friends with
                    somebody who had been the vice chancellor of the University of Harare in the
                    mid-90s. This individual was a close, long time friend of Mugabe and he recalled
                    the times when he was vice chancellor Mugabe, would invite him to drop by the
                    president's residence and chat on a Friday afternoon. They would talk for two or
                    three hours on problems at the university. He would call him Robert and Robert
                    would call him Walter and they would discuss the problems in a very open way.
                    Then in the late '90s, when Mugabe began expropriating farms, Walter who had
                    diabetes and lost his legs and was no longer vice chancellor, asked to see
                    Mugabe based on old time connections. Walter told him that he thought he was
                    wrong in what he was doing and that he was going to bring the country to ruin
                    and that it wasn't too late to correct this and so on. Mugabe listened to him,
                    didn't comment, said goodbye and never spoke to him again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: So that's...</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0156" n="Page0156"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you have any significant contact with
                        Mugabe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: No, no I mean I had periodic contact usually in a pretty formal setting
                    with a visitor but I would even regard my initial contact with him as two of us
                    talking by each other without him really looking for common ground and not at
                    all open to discussions about how we might be able to improve the relationship.
                    So I had pretty good access to virtually everybody else in government and many
                    of them remained close to Mugabe and I'm sure messages would get through with
                    things that particularly bothered us and others that were perhaps areas of being
                    able to work together but effectively we got no serious response. They were
                    embarked on a course and were not to be deterred from it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did we have or do we have now sort of a plan when
                        Mugabe goes what we can do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well I probably can't speak for what we'd do now, but we did then have
                    some serious ideas about what we could do. We did work very closely with the
                    opposition and had excellent relations with them and currently there is a
                    coalition government of sorts in which the opposition leader Tsvangirai is prime
                    minister while Mugabe is president. Mugabe does not adhere very well to the
                    coalition agreement; he declines to name some of the people that Tsvangirai has
                    nominated to the ministerial positions, has kept the president of the central
                    bank notwithstanding the provision that that he was to be changed, but
                    notwithstanding this, the opposition has succeeded in reviving the economy a
                    little bit. Basically they've dollarized the economy and thrown out worthless
                    Zimbabwean dollars, pay teachers in dollars at relatively reduced rates; I think
                    it is about $100 a month but that's better than worthless Zimbabwean dollars
                    they were begin paid before. Probably the economy more than anything else
                    subsists on the remittances sent in from Zimbabwean immigrants living abroad.
                    That said, Zimbabweans are very well educated people, very industrious, when
                    given the opportunity and, I think, it could come back relatively quickly if and
                    when Mugabe goes and if and when there is a reasonable government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do these people who have taken over the farming land have
                        a real stake in it or is this just sort of a place to lounge in or
                        something?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0157" n="Page0157"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I suppose some of them thought they had a stake and thought they could
                    make something out of it but it takes a lot of hard work, it's a seven day a
                    week job, and it takes investment and most of them didn't have capital to invest
                    themselves and the state by that point was so bankrupt that it did not have the
                    capability of leaning money to them. The financial system in general had
                    crumbled in ways that there really was no effective lending for agriculture
                    available. What will happen there is a serious question. I think the opposition
                    at this stage has said that it does not aspire to retake this land that would be
                    a very unpopular act in an overwhelmingly Black African country, but instead try
                    to make it productive again. To do that I would imagine that many of these
                    people would sell their land for whatever the current value was to somebody who
                    was capable and willing to farm on it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well within Zimbabwe are there any people there who have
                        the right skin complexion who could take it over? I mean...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: There are some, and even among those people who were given the land,
                    there are potentially good farmers, given the right circumstances. In addition,
                    there are many black Zimbabweans who have farmed for generations. Even though
                    the system of communal land under which many black Zimbabweans farmed is a
                    dependency-inducing phenomenon in which people don't have land in individual
                    title, but only as part of a community, they do have farming skills. In the
                    right circumstances if black Zimbabweans were to receive land in a system in
                    which the system designed to foster more productive farming and provide them
                    with the means and the capital to do such, I believe many of them would succeed.
                    Zimbabweans have written many excellent plans for how to do just that, but the
                    Mugabe government has been making land distribution decisions on political
                    grounds rather than on the basis of agricultural productivity..</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way could you say you in the embassy were essentially

                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well there were challenges and possibilities and, as I say, we
                    supported the opposition. There was at least one more round of elections, where
                    we tried to monitor to the degree that we could. Yet, at the end of the day
                    there was no effective means of moving Mugabe. The opposition was unable to
                    mobilize sufficient public in the streets to challenge him effectively. I'd say
                    that in some ways Zimbabweans had a history of intimidation; intimidation
                    certainly by Ian Smith and that regime, intimidation during the independence
                    campaign by Mugabe and intimidation in the campaign against Joshua Nkomo in
                    Matabeleland. Most Zimbabweans or their parents have memories of that
                    intimidation and never want to return to that sort of open civil conflict again.
                    And Mugabe has used that in his favor.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Often with embassies you end up with the senior officers,
                        the ambassador, DCM and all you've been around the block you say okay this
                        too shall pass and then you get junior officers who say for God's sake let's
                        do something. Did you find that kind of split?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Not really I think that to the degree there was that phenomenon at the
                    time I arrived, there had been a major and very activist AID mission very
                    involved in democracy building, society building, etc., but in some ways doing
                    their own thing without much coordination. I think we effectively implemented a
                    system of a much more coordinated effort. That, notwithstanding, there were at
                    least some individuals within that mission who were out on the edge, and the
                    usual result of that would be that they would put themselves in situations where
                    either people they were supporting would get arrested and we would try to
                    intervene to prevent the worst. I wouldn't call it a policy dispute it was more
                    differences over how to implement policy effectively.</p>
                <p>We as an embassy were also fairly aggressive. We had one set of officers, who
                    were documenting human rights abuses. They were out in the countryside and they
                    were in effect rounded up by some so-called war veterans under the guidance of
                    Mugabe's security apparatus. They amounted to sharp troops under Mugabe's
                    political control. They came up and set upon our people, they beat an individual
                    from an NGO who had brought our people to the site to talk to people. They laid
                    a few blows on our embassy driver and instructed our group to follow them. Who
                    knows what would have happened, but our embassy driver was wise enough to only
                    follow them for a little and then speed off in the other direction. Our embassy
                    people escaped the situation, but we faced viciousness like that fairly
                    frequently.</p>
                <p>Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, for instance, was being charged at one stage
                    on trumped up treason charges so we and other embassies insisted on witnessing
                    that trial and even forcing our way into the court room, not physically but by
                    our presence. At the end of the day, those charges were dropped and our having
                    insisted on our ability to witness the trial, as provided in Zimbabwean law,
                    helped assure there could not be a secret judgment against him. There were
                    certainly frequent circumstances of human rights abuse and most of what we could
                    do was bear witness to it, document it in our human rights report, complain of
                    it, and seek to have the United Nations pass resolutions condemning such
                    violations. Some of those positions were being undercut by the failure of many
                    Africans to speak out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of human rights abuses were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well there were a couple people killed, not high numbers but probably
                    in the tens of opposition activists killed. Many tortured, many beaten as well
                    as failure to abide by the commitments that Zimbabwe had made in their own
                    constitution and elsewhere to have a fair judicial system, fair civil procedures
                    and humane prison treatment; much of that became politically manipulated.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the British embassy and you and other
                        embassies. Were you all sort of united or doing your thing? How did that
                        work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yeah, I think we were quite united and the British embassy and we
                    exchanged information closely. We had a somewhat larger embassy, but they had a
                    lot of traditional relationships and a lot of information. We exchanged that
                    information, we compared notes on how were could most effectively seek to
                    influence the problems and most of the Europeans were in harmony. The European
                    Union did take pretty strong positions, often at British urging. So the West was
                    fairly united. I spent a lot of time with the Africans because I felt their
                    taking strong positions was likely to be more effective than our taking strong
                    positions. Many of their embassies, if not the majority, were in agreement with
                    the criticism of Zimbabwe, but their governments back home took ambiguous
                    positions. The most important country of all to Zimbabwe, South Africa did not
                    take clear positions. Ironically the critical factor in breaking Ian Smith's
                    government was the decision of the apartheid government of South Africa to end
                    its support for Smith and, in effect, force him to negotiate towards a majority
                    rule. This South African government, Mbeki, was not prepared to do a similar
                    thing and wound up giving cover to Mugabe, even within internal African forums.
                    I think South Africa's unwillingness to take a strong stand was the critical
                    factor in having Africa as a whole not take a stronger stand against the abusive
                    policies of Mugabe.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Funny you should ask that but it was a little bit, a little bit, not a
                    lot but a little bit. Ironically in the midst of my time, there were the
                    beginnings of the great change in U.S.-Libyan relations in a way that made our
                    concern about Libyan involvement in Zimbabwe moot. If the U.S. was now much
                    closer to Libyan what was our problem with Libyan involvement in Zimbabwe. I
                    think the broader point was that Mugabe found himself isolated from the West,
                    which he used to admire. He speaks British English with a terrific accent and
                    great vocabulary. He used to relish his trips to Europe, he had a new young wife
                    who used to love to shop there and he was personally, I think, anguished over
                    being excluded from this life. That said, he did what people do in circumstances
                    like that. He turned to whomever he could and there were a series of countries
                    and leaders willing to give him some comfort, Malaysia and several others. He
                    used to travel there and had a close relationship with the previous Malaysian
                    Prime Minister. He also cultivated better relations with China.</p>

                <pb facs="0160" n="Page0160"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Resources basically,. Zimbabwe does not have petroleum, but it does
                    have a great deal of mineral resources. Zimbabwe's historic resource was chrome
                    that was an issue way back when when the U.S. Senate sought to prevent the
                    administration from boycotting Rhodesian chrome for fear that our only source of
                    chrome would be the Soviet Union. More recently there are other newer resources
                    such as titanium. Zimbabwe had set up in the '90s some investment vehicles for
                    mining and some of it produced significant investment resources. There was also
                    some diamond mining taking place which, I understand, has increased
                    substantially in the last couple of years. The instability in Zimbabwe was
                    diminishing Zimbabwe's attractiveness to Western and even South African
                    investors. China saw opportunities and beginning to invest at the time I was
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have many discussions with the Chinese

                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yeah, I used to do some social events with him and so on. The Chinese
                    at that time had a pretty common line whether it be in Cuba, Angola or Zimbabwe
                    and it tends to be that, “Well sure we advise them to follow our economic reform
                    model and yet we are not going to interfere in their internal affairs. We don't
                    adopt political criteria in our assistance or our investments and, therefore, we
                    are not going to raise political concerns in our conversations. And because we
                    have a great shortage of resources, we acquire them wherever we can and will
                    follow a strict commercial criteria.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then you left there in 2004 was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLVAN: Correct.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0161" n="Page0161"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well I guess stuck, stuck and stuck in a bad place. There's been
                    perhaps a slight improvement since then in that the opposition has joined the
                    government and, at least, introduced some elements of economic rationality. But
                    Mugabe turns 87 this year and doesn't think it is time for him to retire nor to
                    prepare his succession. So it's a sad situation and I'm afraid the Zimbabwean
                    people will continue to suffer until he does go one way or another. There is
                    supposed to be a new election within another year, whether he will do that or he
                    would ever agree to a fair election I am dubious. Certainly within his own party
                    and we did have discussions with a number of people within his own party who
                    wished that he would go, one of whom actually did put himself on the ballot as
                    an independent candidate for president in the most recent presidential election
                    about three years ago and received some modest support. But at the end of the
                    day, most ZANU PF leaders are unwilling or unable to break with Mugabe. And
                    ZANU- PF and Mugabe and his security forces are willing to use whatever force is
                    necessary and whatever fraud is necessary in order to continue in power.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about social life?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Social life? For the majority of our time it wasn't bad, we could get
                    around the country; we could have family come out and visit, go to the game
                    parks and do some terrific things. Those things began to tighten up in our time.
                    There was a period in which there wasn't enough gasoline and we were able to
                    make a separate arrangement in which we got enough gasoline for our own vehicles
                    but certainly if you drove out to the deep country side and needed to refill you
                    were in trouble.</p>
                <p>There was another period in which local currency became unavailable and so there
                    was no way to exchange your dollars for local currency because there wasn't any;
                    yet you needed local currency in order to make most of your purchases. For us it
                    was a relative hardship, we had some means of acquiring things, I think we even
                    sent some convoys down to South Africa to pick up some supplies and bring them
                    back. For our Zimbabwean employees it was a great hardship, an enormous
                    hardship. This had been a relatively sophisticated financial system; we had
                    already some years before instituted direct deposits. I recall the gardener at
                    the residence who was not literate unlike the majority of Zimbabweans going down
                    to use his ATM card to withdraw his money and instead gets a notice that must
                    have said that the bank was out of currency. He put his card in again and it
                    promptly got swallowed and he didn't have an ATM card anymore. We had to
                    negotiate that for him but it was a huge handicap.</p>
                <p>In the convoys of food that we began bringing up we began seeking to take care of
                    our FSN staff as well; they were affected more than us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yeah. When you left did you pay a farewell call?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0162" n="Page0162"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: No, I did not on Mugabe. I decided that it would not be productive,
                    that there would be nothing to be gained. I did call on the foreign minister
                    with whom we had a reasonable relationship but not on the president. I think I
                    decided that it would not be productive and informed Washington that I did not
                    think it would be productive and that we should just leave it to my successor to
                    have the next meeting with the president. My successor had actually got in some
                    difficulties in his confirmation hearings. The nature of these things was that
                    if the U.S. has a difficult relationship with the country one is nominated for,
                    Senators asked very tough questions in the hearings and one is expected to give
                    very tough answers. Yet those tough answers are very unpopular in the country
                    you are going to. So that happened and it became a bit of a flare up in the
                    press with some question about whether Ambassador Dell's agr�ment should be
                    withdrawn. I went in and managed to smooth that over and he was on route. In
                    fact, my successor in Zimbabwe, Chris Dell, had also been my successor in
                    Angola. Chris had the next meeting with Mugabe although I don't think it was any
                    more productive than my meetings with Mugabe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do when you left there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I left and had requested to come back to the U.S. as a
                    diplomat-in-residence. So that's what I did. I took a position as
                    diplomat-in-residence at Tulane University in New Orleans and spent two years
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your impressions of the university?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well the university is a good solid university. I happened to be there
                    the summer of Hurricane Katrina; so that event dominated. I wound up for a time
                    being the State Department's coordinator for international issues affecting New
                    Orleans and the Gulf region in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. The university
                    itself was a good university; it was very disrupted and closed during the fall
                    semester of 2005 after the hurricane but then reopened in the spring. Our
                    strongest interest in the region and the unique role diplomats-in-residence
                    could play was reaching out to students who otherwise might not consider the
                    Foreign Service as a career. I used to spend a lot of my time not at Tulane but
                    at other universities Dillard University, a historically Black university in New
                    Orleans, Southern University another historically Black university in Baton
                    Rouge. I think we had some very good people come out of those settings and make
                    unique contributions to the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of say the local government's
                        response to Katrina?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0163" n="Page0163"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: It had numerous failings. I did not have too much direct responsibility
                    until after Hurricane Katrina and then I did work for a time on a task force
                    based in Baton Rouge. I, like everybody else, had to evacuate the city and
                    basically stayed out and could not return to New Orleans for several months. For
                    most of that period I was the State Department's specially designated emissary
                    to a federal task force that was under FEMA leadership. Certainly the federal
                    government had lots of failings as demonstrated in numerous studies thereafter
                    in its response to Hurricane Katrina, but both the state and the local
                    governments had lots of failings as well. The city of New Orleans in particular
                    had a long history of failure to educate its own people and care adequately for
                    its own people. So the public school system in New Orleans was a disaster. If
                    there was anything good that came out of Katrina, it was creating the conditions
                    for a virtual end of school board authority over local schools in favor of state
                    of Louisiana intervention in that school system. Many charter schools were
                    created and received private foundation support. The New Orleans school board in
                    many cases had diverted funds that were to have been used for the education of
                    children into contracts for their relatives and friends in very corrupt ways
                    that led to convictions of a number of people. So it was a distressing
                    situation. There were people who managed to make it out of that environment and
                    deserved great credit for it.</p>
                <p>I think Louisianans, in particular, have very strong roots and a lot of unique
                    qualities to contribute. So for those that I did manage to recruit, some at
                    Dillard University, some at Loyola University, which was right next door to
                    Tulane, a Haitian-American lady, in particular, I think that they really are in
                    a position to make very interesting contributions to the foreign service. Cynics
                    used to say that New Orleans was the closest we get in the United States to
                    third world conditions with a combination of poverty, corruption and many other
                    problems. Yet they are people with a tremendous amount of humanity. When I came
                    back to the city for the first time after the hurricane and would visit a newly
                    reopened grocery store, we customers and workers would ask each other how we had
                    fared in the storm. The answer that I received most frequently was that they
                    were blessed because even though they had lost their possessions, they and their
                    loved ones had survived. That is a special type of humanity.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: I don't know many parts of the United States that would have not such a
                    spiritual response to their misfortune.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, so just to wind this up what are you up to now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Well I did do after those two years I did two more years with the
                    inspector general's office, which probably I can't talk about very much in any
                    case.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Then I retired in September of 2008 and resettled to Walnut Creek,
                    California. I still do unusually two to three months a year stints for the
                    office of the inspector general so I've lead inspection teams since retiring to
                    one to three African countries, one to Laos and Malaysia last year and to Korea
                    and Mongolia this past spring.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where is Walnut Creek?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLILVAN: Walnut Creek is East Bay so it's about twenty miles east of San
                    Francisco, 15 miles East of Oakland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Yeah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, by the way I am starting with Jack Leonard
                        tomorrow.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Great, great, great. I would say particularly in the business of
                    Nicaragua at the time of negotiating its way into elections Jack has insights
                    that I don't think even anybody in Washington has. I mean I used to talk to him
                    daily.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh that's great.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: But he didn't need to tell me everything he was doing to make things
                    work. He just got them done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, well anyway I want to thank you very much Joe and
                        what will happen now is we've sent, in fact, our last interview has gone to
                        the transcriber so this one will. So within a while you'll get the full
                        transcript and you can edit it and also not just edit it but add. I mean gee
                        I didn't add this, I can expand on that. Please do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: How should I add that just type it in?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You will get it in electronic form. If you can work just
                        put it in.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0165" n="Page0165"/>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You can put in something to keep the conversational thing
                        going and say, “Oh yes, I would like to mention so and so.” I mean that way
                        but don't worry about my questions; it is your account that is going to hold
                        up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Great.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay this is great I really appreciate this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULLIVAN: Likewise Stu. It's been terrific working with you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay well take care.</hi>
                </p>
