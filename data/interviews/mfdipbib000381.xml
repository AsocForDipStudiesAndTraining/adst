                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today I will be talking to Lowell Fleischer on behalf of
                        the Foreign Service Oral history program. Lowell has more than 25 years as a
                        Foreign Service Officer and has developed a specialty in Latin American
                        affairs. In fact he and I were on the staff of the US mission to the
                        Organization of American States some years ago.Lowell, what made you decide
                        on a foreign service career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: I don't know that that is such an easy question to answer. I am from a
                    small little town in Ohio and until I went to college I don't know that I'd been
                    outside of Ohio and Pennsylvania. But once I did go to college, Ohio Western
                    University, that's where I first became interested in foreign affairs. I was a
                    journalism and political science major and from both of my principal professors
                    in those two fields I guess I came to have a fascination with foreign affairs.
                    In fact, during my senior year at Ohio Western I signed up to take the foreign
                    service exam but they didn't give it that year. I don't know whether they still
                    do this or not, but they had a very long waiting list of people already
                    certified or whatever, so they just canceled the test that year. So I went on to
                    graduate school and didn't think much more about it until I was teaching a class
                    one day. It happened to be in diplomatic history. I remember two of my students
                    came up to me after the class and said: “Mr. Fleischer, what it this foreign
                    service business all about?” So we started talking and I sent away for the
                    information for them and decided to take the foreign service exam myself. I
                    guess I lived in constant fear until the results came back that they would get
                    in and I wouldn't and I'd lose control of the class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is a rather unique circumstance, being led in by your
                        own students, but I think it worked out well. Now you passed the foreign
                        service examinations and came to Washington, had your training and were
                        assigned I see to Medellin in Colombia for your first post. That was in
                        1963. What did you do in Medellin?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>FLEISCHER: Medellin was a very small foreign service post. Just as an aside we'll
                    get back to this comment in a minute, but all of those little posts have been
                    closed by now. In a way I think it's too bad because it was a really good
                    training ground. Colombia geographically is four distinct regions really, with
                    the capital around Bogota, then you got the west of the Andes where we had a
                    consulate in Cali, then you had the north coast where we had a consulate in
                    Barranquilla and then Medellin which was the big coffee producing and textile
                    area of Colombia. So we had a two-man post there. There was the principal
                    officer and one vice consul and maybe half a dozen locals: somebody doing USIS
                    work under the direction of the PAO in Bogota and a couple of consular clerks,
                    and I had a commercial clerk who followed the commercial developments. The
                    interesting thing about those kinds of posts ... Obviously I spent most of my
                    time doing consular work—we issued a heck of a lost of visas in those days—but I
                    also did other things. I worked with a local in developing commercial
                    opportunities for US companies and stayed in touch with the commercial attach�
                    in Bogota. It was an important area of the country so we also did some political
                    reporting. Although back in those days communications were obviously not what
                    they are today. We had no direct communication with Washington from that little
                    post at all. We would send a telex to the Embassy in Bogota and then Bogota
                    would send it on. Or if the Department ever really want to get hold of us,
                    they'd send a commercial telegram either in the clear, or if it was classified,
                    I'd have to use a one-time pad to decipher the thing. The one bad experience I
                    remember about the one-time pad very clearly happened when my boss was away. He
                    was a former desk officer for the Dominican Republic and as things started
                    heating up there in 1964-5, Phil Torrey was called back to Washington and
                    eventually to the DR, so I was left running the post myself. During this time we
                    had some textile negotiations with Colombia. We had a textile agreement with
                    Colombia on the amount of certain kinds of textiles that they could send to the
                    United States and the various duties, etc. So the negotiations were going on in
                    Bogota and the textile delegation from Washington came down to Colombia and they
                    were greeted by the Embassy and then they came down to Medellin to do the actual
                    negotiations. Until I managed to get some other system in place the Department
                    was sending instructions for these textile negotiators by commercial cable all
                    of which had to be deciphered by hand using the one-time pad. There were reams
                    of this stuff coming in. Finally I called the Ambassador, Tony Freeman-he was
                    later our Ambassador to Mexico—and I said: “This is just overwhelming us all.
                    We're only an hour's flight away. Can't we get these cables sent to you? They
                    can be deciphered there and sent down here by courier.” It was taking me hours
                    to decode these things. So that's what we finally did. Washington finally
                    listened to reason and they sent these instructions for the textile negotiators
                    to Bogota where they were decoded in Bogota and flown down from Bogota to
                    Medellin. So these small posts provided an invaluable learning mechanism for
                    somebody coming into the Foreign Service. I wouldn't have traded places with
                    anybody in Bogota for any amount of money.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As many new officers, you were rotated, but of course that
                        problem never arose in Medellin since there was no one to be rotated
                        with.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>FLEISCHER: That's right. We did everything anyway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But I think you're absolutely right. You got a chance to
                        try your hand at almost everything including running the post which most
                        junior officers never do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: Yes, in fact when Phil was away for a good length of time during the
                    Dominican crisis, maybe three or four months, and I was running the post, I got
                    Charge pay. The difference between my FSO-8 or -7 salary, whatever it was, and
                    his— he was maybe an FSO-3 or 4 at the time—during that period of time amounted
                    to maybe a couple of thousand dollars. When you're only making six or seven
                    thousand dollars a year, that is a lot of money. I wasn't married in those days
                    and I took that money when Phil came back to post and blew it on my first trip
                    around Latin America. So that's the first time I had an opportunity then to
                    visit other countries in the region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you probably deserved the extra money for the time
                        you were putting in deciphering messages from Washington. What was the
                        situation as regards violence in those years in Colombia.?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>FLEISCHER: Colombia, traditionally, we would have to admit has been a very
                    violent country. I say that as a very good friend of Colombia and somebody who
                    has followed Colombia pretty closely ever since my first exposure to the country
                    some thirty some years ago. There were always pockets of violence, even when I
                    was there traveling around Antioquia. I made a point on a lot of weekends to
                    take the USIS truck and some U.S. movies and go out to villages and show them,
                    usually outdoors on a home-made screen or a white-washed wall. I'd get a chance
                    to meet not only the mayor but lots of other people in those villages. I
                    remember going to one village and being fascinated to find out that everybody
                    there was a member of the liberal party. Colombia, of course, being basically a
                    two-party state divided between liberal and conservative voters. There were no
                    conservative voters in that town at all. This was really an outgrowth of “la
                    violencia,” a period in Colombian life which was almost civil war where the
                    political parties were actually fighting each other. From then on some villages
                    in Andes were of all one political persuasion or another. That way, I guess,
                    they decided they really could trust someone. So there was still that kind of
                    violence. Now, in the cities there certainly was nothing akin to the kind of
                    drug violence which Colombia has unfortunately been subjected to in recent
                    years. Things were relatively calm that way. Another little incident I can think
                    of might illustrate the difference in time. There was a departmental police
                    chief, that is for the department of Antioquia. Colombia is divided into
                    departments equivalent to our states. He called one morning and said he'd had
                    reports that an American plane had crashed. He was sending a crew out to
                    investigate and he wondered if I'd be interested in going with them. I jumped at
                    the chance to do that. It was an arduous trip up into the Andes. We flew, we
                    took a helicopter, we rode horses, mules and finally we walked. We found this
                    plane. It was an old C-47, gooney bird, that had crashed. The call letters had
                    been painted out so it was obviously engaged in smuggling. Inside the plane we
                    found some manifests indicating that the plane was bringing American cigarettes
                    into Colombia. We found other manifests saying they were taking coffee out of
                    Colombia. So they were smuggling US cigarettes, which sold very well in Colombia
                    in those days, into the country and smuggling coffee out. That's how innocent
                    the whole thing was in those days. I can imagine that those same smuggling
                    routes were used in later years when the product was cocaine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel personally threatened while you were there?
                        Was there antagonism toward you as an American official?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>FLEISCHER: Not really. I felt very safe in Medellin. I was a young single person.
                    I had a lot of Colombian friends and I never felt that I was in any danger at
                    all. We did go through one episode brought on by the US intervention in the
                    Dominican Republic. As a lot of people who were there at the time will realize,
                    this energized especially student groups, leftist groups, all over the
                    continent, to protest against the United States. We did have protests in front
                    of the consulate. We were on a main street there in Medellin. Junin was the name
                    of the street, as I recall. We had a lot of protests there because of that and
                    one day, some people from DAS, the Departamento Administrativo de Securidad,
                    which is the Colombian equivalent of our FBI, came by the office to tell me that
                    they'd had a specific threat on my life. I didn't really believe that, but I
                    guess I had to. So they assigned a couple of guards who went around with me for
                    a while. That was all heady stuff for a Vice Consul. I really couldn't believe
                    what was going on anyway. I guess they probably did that for a week or so. I
                    think it's because they got free beer at my house and they were fed fairly well.
                    Eventually I was walking down the street one day and these two guys were behind
                    me and somebody in the American community saw it and raised the question whether
                    they were safe if this was happening to me. That kind of led me to think that
                    maybe that wasn't the best thing and it really wasn't needed. And I talked to
                    the DAS people and the whole thing was called off and nothing ever happened. So
                    I don't know whether that was a false report or whether it was a real report ...
                    But that's the only time when things were really unsettled, the time when those
                    students were up in arms over the US decision in the Dominican Republic. But
                    even they were not violent. There would be some rock throwing, they would sing
                    and chant in front of the consulate and sit down. The place wasn't attacked or
                    anything like that. Looking back, it was pretty calm; there was certainly
                    nothing akin to what we went through in Iran, for example,</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were exciting years in our Latin-American policy of
                        course. We had the Alliance for Progress, we had the Peace Corps. Did they
                        impinge on any of your duties in Medellin?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>FLEISCHER: Yes, both of them very much as a matter of fact. We had quite a few
                    Peace Corps volunteers in Antioquia. The westernmost part of our consular
                    district was in a really remote area of the country. That particular state or
                    department was called the Choco; the capital was Quibdo. I went down there to
                    visit Peace Corps volunteers who were living there and it took me a couple of
                    days to get down to where they were. So we had a lot of rural Peace Corps
                    volunteers. We also had some Peace Corps volunteers in the city. It was a brand
                    new experience. Some of them, most of them, did very well working in specialties
                    such as public health and a few things like that. Some were supposed to be
                    working in city planning, I remember the mayor called me one day just ranting
                    and raving about how these young kids who didn't know beans about running a
                    city, whether it was an American city or a Latin American city, were telling him
                    how the run things. What were they doing there, what was he supposed to do with
                    them? Well, it took us a little while to get that straightened out. But most of
                    them who were health-care specialists or education graduates for the most part
                    probably did a fairly decent job. The Alliance for Progress was a huge program.
                    Colombia was showcase for the Alliance and an awful lot of money went into that
                    country in those days. For a while both my boss and I were spending almost every
                    weekend participating in the inauguration of some new Alliance project. After
                    President John Kennedy was shot, everything was named Kennedy. I must have
                    personally participated in the inauguration of at least a dozen John Kennedy
                    schools in that part of Colombia, built with the help of the Alliance for
                    Progress. So it was a very large program in Colombia in those days. I remember
                    being totally shocked on a visit to the Embassy to find out the incredible
                    number of AID personnel involved in this Alliance project.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were AID people in Medellin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: We had no AID people in Medellin. All of it was all done out of
                    Bogota. Bogota was only an hour's flight away, so it wasn't a huge undertaking
                    to fly back and forth.So we had no AID people there, but a lot of projects being
                    funded by AID in those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, as I recall it, there were two ambassadors at the
                        time you served. Tony Freeman and Covey Oliver. Did they come and visit you
                        in Medellin?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>FLEISCHER: Yes, both of them came regularly, as did the DCM. Henry Dearborn was
                    the DCM. He, of course, had been in Santo Domingo when Trujillo was shot. As a
                    matter of fact, he was our Charge there. I guess we didn't have diplomatic
                    relations. Was he the Charge or the Consul General? Anyway he was the number one
                    there, but he was the DCM in Bogota. Yes, they both came down. It was my first
                    experience , my first opportunity to contrast a career diplomat ambassador, in
                    the case of Freeman, and a non-career ambassador in the case of Covey Oliver.
                    Oliver was not just some political appointee, however. He was a very talented, a
                    very well educated expert on Latin America. I remember as a young Vice Consul
                    thinking there was not that great a difference. That is, they were both very
                    effective and the fact that one was a career officer and the other one a
                    political appointee, at least in my experience, made absolutely no difference.
                    They were both very talented and effective representatives of the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, in 1966 your tour was up in Medellin and you
                        came back to Washington and served for a year in INR?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: I was in INR a couple of years, beginning in 1966. I was the analyst
                    for the United Kingdom which was an interesting sort of assignment too. Had I
                    been the analyst for Colombia or Uruguay or some African country, I think it
                    would have been a different experience. As it was, when you are the analyst for
                    the United Kingdom, everybody from the Secretary on down thinks they understand
                    the United Kingdom. There is very little, it seems to me, that you can
                    contribute to that kind of a dialogue, except watching what is going on and so
                    on and so forth. That assignment was, in terms of career development,
                    interesting mainly because it was my first experience working with CIA analysts,
                    or learning anything about the CIA. We didn't have any CIA officers in Medellin
                    and I didn't get to know the ones in Bogota very well. INR was also my first
                    experience in the Washington bureaucracy. You write a little paper with a heads
                    up on British election, for example, and just clearing it with the desk and then
                    with the CIA analyst and so on and so forth. So it was interesting in that
                    respecAlso I had a great deal of respect for Tom Hughes who at the time was the
                    director of INR. So we got to know him very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tom Hughes later went to London, I believe.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>FLEISCHER: Tom Hughes later went to London. That is correct, as the minister, not
                    the ambassador if you'll remember. It was also during that time that the INR
                    operation in the State Department Operation Center started. The State Department
                    Operation Center was even relatively new. We're talking about 1966, 1967. It was
                    a small little operation and INR began to do an intelligence set up in the
                    operation center so that that could be part of the briefing of the Secretary the
                    next day, You wouldn't find this happening today because I suppose people would
                    sue because of some kind of discrimination or another, but in those days they
                    looked specifically for a couple of bachelors, on the assumption that working
                    nights would not disrupt their family lives and so we were assigned to this new
                    INR duty up in the operation center.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, at the completion of your INR tour, you went back to
                        Latin America, to Santo Domingo. What were you doing there at the
                        Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: I was a political officer at the Embassy in Santo Domingo. That also
                    was a very interesting tour for lots of reasons. One, I just been married. I got
                    married while I was here in Washington. That was almost our honeymoon cruise
                    down to Santo Domingo. In fact we did take a Grace Line ship which you could
                    still do. I think we couldn't go to Santo Domingo by ship, but we sailed to
                    Jamaica, then flew over from Jamaica. I remember arriving in the Dominican
                    Republic without our luggage which had gone astray somewhere. I was a junior
                    political officer there. This was about mid-year of 1968. The US intervention in
                    the Dominican Republic was over by that time, but everyone was still dealing
                    with the aftermath. The Dominican Republic is a very small country, and the US
                    Embassy was huge. We had five State Department political officers in this little
                    island nation. I mean, it's unbelievable, to say nothing of the number of CIA
                    personnel. There must have been twenty. Twenty-five maybe even. I remember when
                    my wife, who was very new to the Foreign Service .returned from a wives meeting
                    and asked me who all those political officers were They were all CIA people. We
                    had an absolutely huge staff in the Embassy. The political reason behind it was
                    that President Johnson's reputation was at stake. He'd sent all of these troops
                    into the Dominican Republic and certainly nobody in the State Department or
                    anywhere else wanted to have some kind of a failure to hang around his neck. So
                    the Embassy was really oversize. You can imagine what work there was for five,
                    FIVE political officers to do in this little island. We knew everybody and we
                    were falling all over each other reporting on the most insignificant youth
                    groups and meetings with people. Some of the stuff that would be in the archives
                    back here that we reported on in those days would, I think, shock people today.
                    Q: Was there much anti-American sentiment then lingering from our deeds in
                    1965?</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>FLEISCHER: I guess there was, Tom, but in some ways I'm surprised that there
                    wasn't more. Again, there were problems with some leftist groups. We'd read
                    things in the newspapers, and there were times for example when we couldn't go
                    across the bridge to go out to the beach because there were anti-American
                    demonstrations going on. But, again it was nothing really very violent. I don't
                    think any of us ever didn't go to a restaurant or go out about town, normal sort
                    of things. We all had very good Dominican friends. But there were lingering
                    resentments. One of the things that I did for a while was follow the activities
                    of the Partido Revolucionario Dominicano, which was Juan Bosch's party in those
                    days. I knew some of the people fairly well. I remember one Senator Pablo
                    Casimiro Castro. He only had one arm because he had been involved in some kind
                    of skirmish and had lost part of his arm during the US intervention. But he was
                    always willing to talk to me. Now, he didn't want to be seen with me necessarily
                    in a public restaurant, so we would always have these clandestine meetings. I'd
                    drive outside of town and meet him at a restaurant, or he would drive over to my
                    house and we'd meet at the house, or something like that. The PRD in those days
                    certainly could be classified as an anti-American party in some sense. They had
                    opposed the US intervention, they were opposing all of the US influence in the
                    Dominican Republic — and there was a lot of US influence. I mentioned previously
                    the large number of USAID people in Colombia when I was there, well it was
                    dwarfed by the number of people we had in the tiny Dominican Republic after the
                    US intervention. We had a whole education section for example that was housed
                    physically in the Dominican Education Ministry. That's how intimately involved
                    we were in running things in the Dominican Republic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our relations with the Balaguer government?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>FLEISCHER: Our relations with the Balaguer government were very good. I thought
                    Balaguer was an old man in those days and here he is still sitting in the same
                    presidential office where I used to see him practically thirty years ago. We
                    used to marvel at reports that he signed personally every check over ten
                    thousand dollars paid by the Dominican government. I think he kept track of the
                    entire country's budget on the back of an envelop in his pocket. I guess he
                    wouldn't do that anymore. He really controlled every aspect of government
                    personally. After all, he came to political maturity in the Trujillo regime and
                    he was pretty used to having it his way. Our relations with the government were
                    really quite good, however. The depth in ministries was pretty shallow and if
                    you really wanted something done or find out something you had to talk to the
                    Minister or maybe you talked to the Vice-Minister, but certainly nobody below
                    that. No one else had any real authority. John Crimmins, who was our Ambassador
                    when I got there, maintained excellent relationships with the whole government.
                    I think he would be a good example of an activist US Ambassador during this
                    period of time. I don't think anything went on in the Dominican Republic that he
                    didn't know about. For all practical purposes, he was his own political
                    counselor, his own AID director, etc. He knew absolutely everything that was
                    going on and he wanted to have his hand in everything that was going on. In
                    those days, we used to write so-called “Weekas” which were weekly summaries of
                    events, and send them to Washington. It was not always the highest priority on
                    everybody's list to get that thing done and it usually fell to the lowest guy on
                    the staff, which was me, so I'd end up writing the thing. I remember spending
                    some Saturday morning sitting with John in his office because John didn't like
                    the way the “weeka” was written. If the report, no matter how insignificant, was
                    going our under his name, he wanted it to reflect his opinions and his take on
                    things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, most ambassadors I know had never heard of the
                        “weeka.” It just goes on without them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: That was not the case with Ambassador Crimmins.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But we also had relations with the opposition I take it
                        from what you are telling me about your relations with the PRD?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>FLEISCHER: Yes, we did, and as time went on while we were there, those relations
                    got a little bit better. I can remember having affairs at my home when
                    opposition politicians would actually come. I think during that time our
                    relations with the opposition did count. We were always very prompt to follow up
                    coup rumors and that sort of thing. I can remember many a night going out trying
                    to find somebody in the PRD, or somebody in the Social Christian Party which was
                    another opposition party in those days. It has since merged with the official
                    party and it's all one now, but there was a separate Social Christian Party
                    then. And putting out the word, you know, that the United States was unalterably
                    opposed to any undemocratic change of government had its effect. The Military
                    Attach�s as well as those in the Milgroup were quite busy trying to build up
                    relations with the general staff as well other officers as low as second
                    lieutenant. The military was still a pretty strong and influential outfit. But
                    we certainly had the staff in the Embassy to try to find out what was going
                    on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there during that rather bitter election campaign
                        they had in 1970?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: I was indeed. And it was a bitter election campaign. All of us spent a
                    lot of time out in those days just trying to figure out what was going on and
                    who was going to do what to whom during that campaign. We set up a headquarters
                    back in the Ambassador's office and we followed things very closely. It was a
                    very bitter campaign and the United States became part of that obviously. It
                    would have been hard not to have been a part of it. But I think the Embassy came
                    out of that fairly well. John Crimmins by that time was back in Washington as
                    the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Inter-American Affairs. He had been
                    replaced by Frank Malloy. It was Frank's first ambassadorial appointment. He had
                    been the DCM in Rome just before being named ambassador to the Dominican
                    Republic. He was a consummate professional. He was determined that the staff
                    should go out to gather information about what was happening, but that we should
                    not become part of the campaign. Eventually Jack Crowley, who eventually
                    replaced you at USOAS, arrived as DCM. Frank Devine had been John Crimmins's
                    DCM. So again two highly rated professionals who later on went to become
                    ambassadors in their own right. So I think for the most part we were able to
                    keep the Embassy as big, as influential, and as meddling if I may be so blunt as
                    to use that phrase as the Embassy was during that election campaign. We at least
                    were able to keep ourselves from becoming an issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask one final question with regard to the Dominican
                        Republic. Looking back on it, when you were there, was there a feeling that
                        intervention in '65 was necessary, worthwhile or did it do more harm than
                        good?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>FLEISCHER: I'm sure Tom you will find people who will say it did more harm than
                    good, but the judgment of people I knew then, and the Dominicans with whom I
                    have kept in contact over the years since then, is more positive than that. I
                    know an awful lot of Dominicans who are convinced that because of the US
                    intervention, the Dominican Republic is a more viable political entity today
                    than it would have been had an all out civil war developed without US
                    intervention. Now there are some died-hard partisans — Juan Bosch for example
                    would never obviously agree to that; neither would Pena Gomez who was the PRD
                    candidate in this last election and who some analysts think actually beat
                    Balaguer but was cheated out of his rightful election victory. There are people
                    like that, activists who are convinced that the US intervention should not have
                    taken place and did more harm than good. I don't know that given the climate
                    today that we end up doing the same thing in such a small island again. I cannot
                    imagine the American people tolerating the same kind of intervention in Haiti
                    today, no matter what the problem there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, following your tour there you were sent to the
                        University of Massachusetts as the John Quincy Adams lecturer. That was
                        quite a prestigious assignment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: Again, I guess those things don't happen anymore because those kinds
                    of assignments count as training years on Department records, so I think that
                    quite frankly those have gone by the way side. But that was a very interesting
                    year. John Blacken who later went on to become a ambassador to one of the
                    smaller African countries, I can't remember which one now, was my predecessor in
                    that post at the University of Massachusetts. The Department of State continued
                    to pay my salary and I was a faculty member at the University of Massachusetts.
                    The University provided some office space and a secretary and that was their
                    part of the bargain, and I taught some classes. It was interesting for me to do
                    that. I had an academic background as it was and just barely finished my Ph.D.
                    before I came in the Foreign Service. But I can remember for example teaching
                    one seminar on the Dominican Republic. Howard Wiarda, who is a well-known Latin
                    American analyst and author of many books on the region — he's been teaching for
                    the last two years at the National Defense University here in Washington—is
                    still on the faculty at the University of Massachusetts in the political science
                    department. I had met Howard in the Dominican Republic while he was doing some
                    research while I was living there and when he found out that I was coming to the
                    University of Massachusetts as a John Quincy Adams scholar, we planned a seminar
                    together and we taught a seminar on the Dominican Republic which I think for the
                    graduate students was really extraordinary in a way. I had just come back from a
                    couple of years of living there, active policy-level experience there, and
                    Howard was just back and with his academic experience, and putting the two
                    together I think it was a very good idea. What the Department eventually got out
                    of this year that I spent there, I don't know. It was a reverse sabbatical and I
                    enjoyed it, and certainly enjoyed living in Amherst. I think we also provided a
                    service for the Department. I did a lot of speaking on behalf of the Department
                    of State and on behalf of the Foreign Service to some unfriendly college
                    audiences.</p>

                    <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to ask. This was the period of course at the
                        end of the Vietnam war when things were not very favorable for us on college
                        campuses. And also I think there was some criticism of our intervention in
                        the Dominican Republic. Did you sense a lot of this hostility?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: Oh yes. Definitely. Some of it cuts both ways, of course. I can
                    remember one class I was teaching and at the beginning of the class the students
                    didn't know that I was a Foreign Service Officer and was just there for a year.
                    I was just Professor Fleischer as far as they knew until later in the semester
                    we talked about it. I remember one thing to make my ... “God, I didn't now that
                    somebody who was a representative of what was described as the fascist US
                    government could be so reasonable.” That's one side of the coin. The other side
                    of the coin is, I was asked to speak once at Hampshire college. In the Amherst
                    you have not only the University of Massachusetts but you have Amherst college,
                    Holyoke is very near, Smith is very near, and there's Hampshire college and they
                    have a very active five college conference. Students enrolled in one school can
                    take classes in another, and that sort of thing. Well Hampshire is a very
                    non-traditional four year liberal arts school. Very few requirements, test, and
                    that sort of thing, and I think some students thrive on that. As a matter of
                    fact, the daughter of a former boss of mine, Bart Moon, went there and she's
                    quite a delightful young lady. I don't mean to suggest that certain kinds of
                    students can't get a good education there, I think they can. But in those days,
                    it was sort of a hotbed of anti-US government, anti-war fervor; in any case I
                    was actually booed and hooted off of a platform when I was speaking there one
                    day. So sentiment was really quite strong and became even more so when President
                    Nixon increased the bombing and sent troops into Cambodia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, we did in 1970.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: The whole Southeast Asia scenario, especially every escalation there
                    would rile some students considerably. So when you are in that king of a
                    situation, all you can do is try to sit down with them and remind them that they
                    are in an atmosphere where inquiry and learning and testing of ideas, of trying
                    to understand the other guy's point of view, that that's why they're there. That
                    is certainly what I was trying to do in those kinds of instances. I was still on
                    the Department payroll, so I felt some obligation to defend US policy even to
                    the extent in some cases that I wasn't sure that I personally felt that that
                    policy was correct. But you know you do your best in those kinds of
                    circumstances.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have anyone follow you into the Foreign Service.
                        Did you encourage any of the students, or did any of them show any interest
                        in it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>FLEISCHER: Oh yes. The students did show interest, and I know of a couple of grad
                    students whose committees I served on at the time I was there who later did come
                    into the Foreign Service. I would be the last one in the world to say that I was
                    responsible for that, but simply being in a position where they could talk to a
                    real-live Foreign Service Officer in a very informal kind of setting, I think
                    that was helpful to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then let me say that I think you were probably an
                        excellent example to them. After that interesting years, you came back to
                        Washington and went to the Foreign Service Institute for several years where
                        you were in charge of training for Latin American.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: Yes, that's right. I guess that was another assignment that I
                    thoroughly enjoyed. It was also in retrospect as one looks back an assignment
                    that I probably shouldn't have taken because it was a time when I was looking to
                    be promoted and it was not a kind of assignment, despite what Personnel in the
                    Department tells us. Had I been more astute, I should immediately have tried to
                    get to a desk and to an active position in a bureau or whatever. Instead I sort
                    of did what I wanted to do and what was going to be interesting to me and I
                    certainly enjoyed it, but in the long run I don't think it was a good career
                    move. But I think training at the Foreign Service Institute is very important
                    for officers going out. I have not had the opportunity yet to visit the new FSI,
                    and I certainly would want to do that because I think we've come a long way
                    since I studied Spanish in the basement of some apartment house over in Rosslyn
                    as I remember. And I can remember a lot of FSOs coming through who were going to
                    Latin America for the first time and try to provide them with some kind of
                    background I think just makes all the kind of sense in the world. I think FSI
                    now is doing a much better job of it that we even did in those days because it's
                    become integrated with language studies and the whole thing works on a more kind
                    of rational basis. So from that standpoint I certainly don't regret that
                    assignment. I met a lot of people and thoroughly enjoyed it. I just think that
                    as a career move, it was not the best thing in the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you lecture yourself or did you arrange to bring
                        others in, experts in their field?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: Well, I did lecture myself because I thought I knew, had not only
                    experience but an academic training which permitted to do that. But the big part
                    of that job is just getting the right kind of people to bring in and get them
                    together with people in the field. I also knew a lot of people active in Latin
                    America all around, so we did that a lot. Area studies was not always popular.
                    That is to say, we all think, Foreign Service officers especially it seems to me
                    think that (end of tape)</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>We can be plunked down in the middle of another situation, in another country,
                    and somehow by osmosis will pick it up. But I think if training is done right
                    and now with their integrating area training with the language training, I think
                    that probably today, a Foreign Service officer going off to almost any country
                    in the world is probably going to be much better prepared for that experience
                    than either you and I were for a lot of assignments that we had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Absolutely right. I used to know a Foreign Service Officer
                        now unfortunately departed who said he could land anywhere in the world and
                        get operating within twelve hours as long as he had a case of scotch with
                        him. What was the emphasis during your years as chairman of Latin American
                        Studies? Was it on Chile, because that was the time we were having trouble
                        there. On Cuba, on Brazil, on the Andean countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: Well again, today things are much better organized at FSI and they've
                    got a little bit more money so they can break areas down. For example the Latin
                    American program now if you're going to Colombia, you would be part of an Andean
                    group. If you're going to Argentina you can be part of a southern cone group. We
                    didn't have the resources in those days to do that. So that we tried to do a lot
                    of more general kind of work. I mean, the role of the church in Latin America
                    just to give you one example. And then we would, depending on the number of
                    students enrolled who were going to certain places, then we'd try to tailor the
                    people that we'd ask to come in to talk to those particular countries. So I
                    wouldn't say that we had a particular emphasis on anyone country in those days.
                    The thing I think we did not, again in retrospect, have enough emphasis on, was
                    the whole economic and commercial side of things. I don't know that the Foreign
                    Service as a whole in the 1970s which is the period we are talking about placed
                    enough emphasis on the economic/commercial role of the Foreign Service. Those of
                    us who were political officers thought that was the be all and end all of an
                    embassy, and if you were the political councilor, you sort of deserved to be
                    next to the ambassador and the DCM because that was the political section. I'm
                    afraid that when I ran the Latin American course at FSI, I placed much too much
                    emphasis on political factors and the political side of the equation and not
                    nearly enough on the economic/commercial side of things. Again that's now in
                    hindsight, going back. Look at Mexico which is in the news regularly now, or
                    look at Chile, or Argentina or Brazil. The questions that come to the forefront
                    today when we talk about all of those countries are really economic questions.
                    They're not political questions. They're economic questions. And even those
                    political questions which do come up and they do obviously from time to time
                    have some kind of economic background, some economic connotation to them. So I
                    think we shortchange people, again looking back now with twenty years of
                    experience in the area, on the whole economic side of the house.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your experiences with the ARA bureau, the Latin
                        American bureau during the ... Did they show any interest and
                        cooperation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>FLEISCHER: No, they did and I must say, I have very good memories of my
                    experiences with ARA, whether it was to get a Deputy Assistant Secretary to come
                    over to open a class, or whether it was to get an officer, director or a desk
                    officer over to meet the people of particular countries, I never had any
                    difficulties in that regard at all. I think for the most part that was true of
                    other areas of Area Studies at FSI. The bureau was unfailingly cooperative in
                    providing personnel and providing time, of making time, to meet with new
                    officers going out. The only time bureau was really stingy was in not wanting
                    officers to be at FSI at all. They needed them at post last month rather than
                    two months in the future. So the problems you really had were with the executive
                    office of the bureau rather than with the policy or substantive side of the
                    house.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now when your tour in FSI was ended you had a complete
                        change. You were sent to Yugoslavia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: Yes, that was a deliberate decision on my part. I felt that I had been
                    in the Foreign Service by that time a good ten years, almost all of it connected
                    with Latin America, except for a stint in INR and I really thought I wanted to
                    get some experience in another area of the world. I found out that there was a
                    political slot open in Belgrade and so I applied for language training with the
                    idea of going into that slot. As it turned out I never did go to that slot
                    because for personal reasons the person who was in it was kept on for a year and
                    by that time I was already five months into nine or ten months of language and
                    area training and decided I would still like to go to Belgrade. So I consented
                    to become counselor of consular affairs and off to Belgrade we went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you went there with Serbo-Croatian language

                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: It was Serbo-Croatian language training. Ten months we had, nine or
                    ten months of Serbo-Croatian language training, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it a happy embassy when you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>FLEISCHER: Yes it was. You know, Belgrade was an interesting place in those days.
                    Marshal Tito was still very much a leader of the non-aligned movement. He was an
                    important figure when it came to world affairs. Tito was always consulted on
                    issues by both east and west. So things were interesting politically. It was
                    also interesting because I arrived at the same time as a new Ambassador, a
                    non-career ambassador who had been the Deputy Secretary of Labor. This was
                    Lawrence Silberman who is now a member of the US Court of Appeals for the
                    District of Columbia. A very militant republican who had been an acting member
                    of the cabinet practically when he was Deputy Secretary of Labor. Anyway I met
                    him in Washington before we went out there and was quite frankly very impressed
                    with him. The DCM was a career foreign service officer, Dudley Miller The
                    Ambassador brought with him a staff aide whose name now has slipped my mind, but
                    somebody from outside the foreign service. Eventually the staff aide and the DCM
                    were clashing and stepping on each others' toes and one day we went to the staff
                    meeting and found out that the DCM was no longer going to be the DCM but was
                    going back to Washington. He was in essence fired by the Ambassador. That
                    disrupted things at post on the personnel level for quite a while. No DCM was
                    ever sent out again and in effect Ambassador Silberman's staff aide became the
                    DCM, never in name, but in many functions. Those of us who were section chiefs
                    went right to the Ambassador with many issues that ordinarily would have gone to
                    the DCM. We really did not miss another layer. So it worked out for some of us
                    anyway. This may be an appropriate time again to comment on the issue of
                    non-career ambassadorLarry Silberman had his supporters and his detractors
                    within the Embassy. I consider myself one of his supporters. I think Larry was
                    able in some ways to be a more effective ambassador at that particular time in
                    Yugoslavia than perhaps a career ambassador would have been. He was willing to
                    step on some Department toes. He also knew personally a lot of the members of
                    President Jerry Ford's cabinet and was able to get them to come to Yugoslavia.
                    I'm not sure under other circumstances that they necessarily would have wanted
                    to do that. I remember Bill Simon for example, the Secretary of the Treasury,
                    coming through and I think this was important for a lot of reasons. I don't know
                    that the Embassy would necessarily have disagreed with any policy line that EUR
                    was trying to push. It wasn't that so much as Silberman just deciding that he
                    was the guy in the spot. He was willing to take a few more chances, let's say,
                    than I think maybe a career ambassador would have been able to take under the
                    same circumstances. I would like to mention one case in particular that I had
                    worked on for over a year as the Counselor for Consular Affairs. We had a US
                    citizen by the name of Lazlo Toth who had been arrested by Tito's police for
                    alleged industrial espionage. This guy was a chemical engineer employed in the
                    sugar manufacturing business in the U.S. He was born in Serbia, educated in the
                    U.S., and became a U.S. citizen. He was back visiting his family. There was a
                    sugar plantation nearby where he had worked as a young man and he was visiting
                    that sugar plantation and took some photographs. Well, he was arrested for
                    taking photographs and they charged him with industrial espionage of all things
                    — as if the sugar plant technology in Yugoslavia was on a higher plane than it
                    was in Colorado. Well it took us over a year to get him released and I am
                    convinced that the only way we were able to get him released was to have people
                    like Bill Simon put that issue at the top of his agenda when he went to call on
                    officials in the Yugoslav government. And we did the same thing with absolutely
                    every U.S. officials who came to Belgrade. Larry Silberman thought it was an
                    absolute outrage that Lazlo Toth had been arrested on obviously trumped up
                    charges and my instructions from him were to do everything I could to get the
                    guy out. Ambassador Silberman told me that he was willing to do anything I asked
                    him to do. I don't want to be too harsh on the foreign service at all, but we
                    could have had a career ambassador in that situation who would have been
                    reluctant to smash as many Yugoslav toes as we smashed trying to get this guy
                    out. Larry Silberman didn't care if he was criticized for devoting so much time
                    to one American in jail. He thought it was an absolute outrage and we were going
                    to get the guy out. I just know a lot of foreign service officers who would have
                    been reluctant to do that. So I think Silberman did a good job. He would have
                    been more effective had he spoken Serbo-Croatian as his successor Larry
                    Eagleburger did. I also think that Silberman was more willing to ruffle Tito's
                    feathers than some career ambassadors would have been. It was probably a time in
                    the twilight of Tito's presidency where he needed somebody to ruffle a few
                    feathers. So I think Silberman was very, very good at doing that. At the same
                    time he was able to keep confidences and being effective in operating the people
                    below Tito's level. But in Yugoslavia in those times it was Tito and nobody
                    else. I mean we all tried to get to know other level people. We all tried to put
                    our best thinking caps on and come up with scenarios about what would happen to
                    Yugoslavia when Tito was no longer there. I'm sorry to say that I don't think
                    any of us could have predicted the eventual fate that befell the country.
                    Although we did have a pretty good indication that it was only Tito, the glue
                    that was holding the thing together. I can remember for example another little
                    anecdote. “Borba”, the official communist party newspaper, was published in
                    Belgrade in Cyrillic and in Zagreb in the Latin alphabet. Well, if I did not
                    feel like struggling with Cyrillic on some days I might pick up a Latin edition
                    because it was a little bit easier for me to read even though in those days my
                    Serbo-Croatian was fairly decent. One day I was in my office reading it when the
                    chief local consular assistant, a lawyer who had studied abroad, and an
                    intellectual Serb on whom I relied on him for a lot of things, came into my
                    office and he saw me reading Borba with the Latin lettering in it and he had a
                    fit. How could I think that I was understanding the true meaning of what I was
                    reading, that I was getting as much as I could out of that article if I was
                    reading it in Latin as opposed to reading it in Cyrillic. That's just one tiny
                    little anecdote that illustrates I think the strong antagonistic feelings which
                    the various nationalities which had been jammed together in this artificial
                    country. Let's face it, that's what Yugoslavia was. That's just one little
                    anecdote I think that served to illustrate how strong the feelings were among
                    the various parts of Tito's empire in those days.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to get out of Belgrade, to travel around the
                        country at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>FLEISCHER: I traveled quite a bit as a matter of fact. Belgrade was not a closed,
                    completely closed society in those days. We were watched and we used to play
                    little games with the police who we knew were writing down the diplomatic tag
                    numbers of our cars, for example. But as a consular officer it was a little bit
                    easier for me to travel sometimes than as a political officer because I could go
                    to an area on the pretext of visiting U.S. citizens, investigating social
                    security checks, visiting U.S. citizens in jail, etc. I mean I was going to an
                    area to visit an American in jail or whatever, and use that time that I was
                    there to do other things as well. So it was fairly easy to travel around, and
                    interesting to travel around in Yugoslavia. Serbia was fairly well off.
                    Yugoslavia is like a lot of other European countries in the sense that the
                    northern part of the country was the rich part and the southern part was the
                    poor part. That seemed to hold true for Yugoslavia as well. You would get down
                    near the Albanian border for example or on your way down towards Greece and
                    those were the poor areas. One of the things that struck me traveling around
                    during that period of time were the number of half-finished houses we would see.
                    You would be traveling around in Serbia and there would be a farm field and all
                    of a sudden you would see a half-finished house, fairly good size and wonder
                    what was going on. Well, what most of this was, there were a lot of
                    gastarbeiters in Germany ... Serbs who went to Germany to work as “guest
                    workers.” They would come back with their earnings, and use them to start
                    building a house, buying a little business or whatever. They would return to
                    Germany and work again and plow their earning back into their houses in Serbia.
                    This was happening all over. There were a lot of Serbians working in Germany. I
                    remember another little incident to illustrate that. I had a Volkswagen sedan, a
                    bigger Volkswagen with a rear-engine and a fuel injection system. I had trouble
                    with the fuel injection system and I had trouble getting somebody in Belgrade to
                    fix it and decided I would take it to Austria. When I took it to the shop, the
                    mechanic was a Serb. So there were a lot of them in Germany and Austria and
                    other parts of western Europe who had gone up there to work. It was a society
                    which was functioning, but it was also a society where you knew that in Croatia,
                    for example, or in Slovenia which were the two northernmost sections of the
                    country, the two richest, the two closest to western Europe where they were
                    obviously pushing the communist envelope. You would talk to people up there who
                    owned small factories for example. The Yugoslavs were always sort of flexible.
                    You could have a private restaurant or a private business as long as you only
                    employed a handful of people - I don't remember the exact number — outside of
                    your own family. In Croatia and Slovenia, they were always expanding that trying
                    to add more, pushing the envelope as it were. But Yugoslavia was certainly
                    better off in those days than a lot of the other eastern European countries.
                    Among other things, I was president of the school board in Belgrade for a year
                    or two and I remember getting a call from my counterpart who was also an embassy
                    officer in Sophia. I got a call one day asking me whether it was possible to buy
                    a water heater or nails on the market in Yugoslavia. I said: “My God, yes, you
                    can buy a water heater any place; there are a lot of hardware stores.” So he
                    came over personally in an embassy vehicle to get a new water heater for the
                    school in Sophia because they were not available in Bulgaria.</p>

                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>FLEISCHER: From one communist country to another. So in that sense, certainly
                    economically in those days Yugoslavia was much better off than Romania or
                    Bulgaria for example.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there evidences then of the strong Moslem nationalism
                        that we're seeing now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: Yes, there were. Obviously, you went down to Moslem territory, to
                    Sarajevo, the scene of so much bitterness today. I can remember on several trips
                    to Sarajevo and I can't imagine that that place has almost been obliterated from
                    what we see on television today, but the Moslem influence was extremely strong.
                    You would talk to a mayor or a city councilman or a Moslem leader in that area
                    and it was very evident that there was a resentment toward Belgrade that was a
                    little more than the resentment that you find in many other places toward the
                    capital city. I mean, you and I have both served in countries where if you're
                    not in the capital city there was always a resentment there. I found that in
                    Colombia, I found that in lots of other places where I served, but this was more
                    than that. You knew that religion was at work. The other thing that I've thought
                    about a lot since then with the recent break up of the country, the Serb against
                    Moslem, the husband against wife in some cases which we've all read about, when
                    you look at it historically and you try to reason it out and you think that it's
                    really just almost an accident of history. The line between where Roman
                    Catholicism and the Latin alphabet was the norm, and on the other side where
                    eastern orthodox religion and the Cyrillic alphabet are used is where the
                    advance of the Ottoman Empire was stopped. A lot of the Moslems are ethnically
                    and racially the same stock as the Serbs. So, you know, if the line had been
                    fifty miles away, we'd be dealing with an entirely different situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were some prominent visits I gather during your time
                        in Yugoslavia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: Yes, there were. President Ford came through for example, to
                    Belgrade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this when Tito was still alive?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>FLEISCHER: Yes, that was when Tito was still alive. President Ford had a very
                    successful visit to Belgrade. Tito went personally to the airport to greet him.
                    Tito didn't always do that for a foreign visitor, and he went personally to
                    greet President Ford and met him at the airport. That was an extremely busy time
                    for us and I think that that visit really went very well and served I think a
                    lot of good purposes during that particular time. I don't think presidential
                    visits always do that. But this was a novelty there in Yugoslavia and I think it
                    worked quite well. We had other high level visitors during that time. I remember
                    a visit by Carl Albert who was the Speaker of the House of Representatives at
                    the time. That was a disastrous visit, I think you can say. Albert is still
                    alive so maybe I should be more careful in what I say, but Albert was known in
                    those days as a pretty heavy drinker and he continued to do so while he was on
                    that trip. I mean in the control room, we eventually had to lock liquor up and
                    he got pretty annoyed with us I must say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've been in several experiences like that with our
                        congressional representatives.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: But this was the Speaker of the House of Representatives for heaven's
                    sakes. Tito honored him with an official dinner. Tito was always not present at
                    such events. Albert could not even remember the name of the country he was in
                    and when he got up to respond to a toast he thought he was in Czechoslovakia. I
                    mean he got countries mixed up. I mean that was a kind of disastrous visit. So
                    there was both the good and the bad. Traveling in Yugoslavia was very easy.
                    Geographically it's a very good place to be stationed. We drove to Greece and it
                    was an easy drive to Vienna or to Budapest and roads were pretty decent. The
                    north-south route was fairly dangerous. You get Greek and Turkish truck drivers
                    on the way to Western Europe and in those days it was really only a two-lane
                    highway and they weren't exactly too careful about pulling over and sleeping
                    when they should. But you could put your car in a car-train in Belgrade and go
                    from Belgrade to Ljubljana and in no time at all you'd be in northern Italy or
                    drive over the pass and be in Austria. So it was a very good geographical
                    location. It was a very pleasant place to be assigned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, after that tour in Belgrade you returned to
                        Washington, to the Operation Center where you spent several interesting and
                        probably exciting years.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>FLEISCHER: The Operation Center in those years was very exciting and we had
                    really a lot going on. Personally and professionally that was very interesting
                    because it gave me an opportunity to work fairly closely with the Secretary and
                    the top people in the Department of State and it seemed we had some crisis or
                    other going on. The Iran crisis developed at the time I was Deputy Director of
                    the Center. I remember the night quite well when we opened a telephone line to
                    the Embassy and kept it open for days at a time. Afterward I remember one of the
                    bean counters in the bowels of the building calling me and questioning a $26,000
                    phone bill!. And that was from an opened line that we had kept open. We expanded
                    our facilities then because we had almost a permanent Iranian working group
                    going on and we had to have space for them up in the Operation Center. The other
                    thing that tour did for me was to make me even more leery of the Washington
                    bureaucracy. Dealing with the bureaucracy not only in your own building, but in
                    every other building in town at that time, why that was a very humbling
                    experience. We were also at that time just on the edge of the communications
                    revolution. It's amazing what has happened since then. I can remember for
                    example, now it's routine, the embassies have word processors and all that
                    stuff. But I can remember working with Xerox to develop what we called in those
                    days LDX which permitted us to send via a scanning device, paper from the White
                    House to the State Department and have it classified. Today faxes are a fact of
                    life. In those days it certainly didn't work as easily. Just the size of this
                    machinery that we had developed at Xerox to allow us to encrypt a piece of paper
                    and have it come out at the other end was amazing.</p>

                        DOD, CIA? Because I know that the Operation Center has a line to each one of

                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>FLEISCHER: Yes, we have a direct phone line to each one of those buildings and we
                    found ourselves working extremely closely with each one of them during a lot of
                    these crises, for example the Iranian crisis. On the working level, the
                    relationship was always extremely good, whether we were talking to watch
                    officers in the middle of the night and another agency, sharing information,
                    there was never any problem at all. It was always the next day when turf battles
                    began to come out and those turf battles were always fought up the line from the
                    working level guys who seemed to be getting along fairly well in my view. But
                    there were always fires to put out the next day because of turf battles
                    developing. Operations Center directors from all agencies used to meet and get
                    together and work out problems and for the most part I think the flow of
                    information and the sharing of information was pretty good. There was always
                    those turf battles, however, some of them caused by ambassadors in the field.
                    You know the notion gets around that if you want the Secretary or even the
                    Assistant Secretary to read a cable it has at the very least be EXDIS. better if
                    it's NODIS. And then if you make the decision that that information is vital to
                    other agencies as well and you distribute them, feathers get ruffled. Every day
                    I had to call one of our embassies to inform an ambassador or DCM that I had
                    down graded or reclassified their exclusive distribution cable for such and such
                    a reason. I got phone calls from ambassadors overseas telling me that I had
                    absolutely no business doing that, that that was in their prerogative, etc. So
                    you just have to be your own diplomatic self and say: “I'm sorry Mr. Ambassador,
                    but I did that for various reasons and if you care to call someone else, why you
                    can do that.” I don't know how it is today; communications have changed so
                    rapidly since I left the Service.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: No, that's right. But the number, the growth of that kind of limited
                    distribution material was a real worry to me in the late '''70s and I can
                    imagine what it is today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me, did Foreign Service officers want to work in the
                        Operations Center or did you have to dragoon them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>FLEISCHER: Well, we certainly didn't have to dragoon junior officers. We never
                    had any problems attracting top-notch junior officers to assist on the watch or
                    to be editors; those were very sought-after posts. We'd have our choice of
                    people because they could always count on getting a good job after that kind of
                    experience; and we did out best to help them with their next assignments. Even
                    senior watch officers, who I think were FSO-4s, under the old system of
                    classification, had a lot of responsibility. They were always sought-after
                    positions. You know, we were replacing somebody and I had personnel send me up a
                    stack of files, why, I always had good number of people to choose from who were
                    willing to do those jobs. It wasn't always easy and I do think that some people
                    didn't mind the odd hours and working very strange schedules. You'd work a
                    couple of weeks during the day, then a couple of weeks from afternoon till
                    midnight, then a couple of weeks midnight to 8 a.m., the kinds of shifts you
                    were on. But some people didn't adjust very well to that. They had real trouble.
                    But for the most part, they were able to do that. They also liked to do it
                    because there was a little bit of money deferential involved in doing that and
                    some overtime, etc., which was another real headache for me at the time I was
                    there negotiating with the money managers about cutting down costs, but at the
                    same time trying to build up enough incentive there that it was going to be well
                    worth people's minds of doing that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there during some exciting developments in our
                        foreign policy. This was when we signed the Camp David agreements I
                        gathered.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: It was when we signed the Camp David agreements and leading up to that
                    point that Roy Atherton, the regional Assistant Secretary would often come into
                    the Operations Center after some evening event and write a cable to the field. I
                    usually worked during the days and was not there at night, but sometimes if a
                    senior watch officer had to be off or whatever I'd work the night shift or stay
                    on for whatever reason and I remember a couple of occasions when Atherton would
                    come in at eleven o'clock at night after having been at a black tie affair at
                    the Egyptian Embassy or the Israeli Embassy, and having he thought worked out a
                    little piece of the puzzle and coming in and sitting down and drafting his own
                    cables. One time I remember he came in and asked me if he could sit down and do
                    it in longhand if I had somebody who could put it on the machine to sent it out.
                    I said: “We can certainly do that.” Another time I can remember very
                    vividly—again this was pre-word processor days—coming in and he sat down at a
                    typewriter, and did a cable for himself and we sent it out. That's one of the
                    little things I can remember about the Camp David accord.</p>

                    And again that was at a time ... I guess we still had the Iranian group going
                    and we had another working group going for some reason, and when I had to
                    establish yet a third on Afghanistan ... We were using every bit of space we had
                    physically ... We had so many people in there working on one kind of problem or
                    another. But when there was a Foreign Service Officer shot abroad or in the case
                    or Iran when the captives were taken that really influenced an operation like no
                    other. It's really a colleague in trouble, or a colleague down ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We also had the seizure of the Embassy in Pakistan
                        too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: The seizure of the Embassy in Pakistan. We had a whole series of such
                    events during that time. What it comes down to what the Op. Center is really the
                    nerve center of the Department when it comes to all of the examples you have
                    just named and the job of all the people there is really to make certain
                    information gets to the people on the 7th floor up to and including the
                    Secretary, that that information is immediately available to them. The operating
                    style of the principals varied a lot, for example. Secretary Vance used to walk
                    in a lot, especially when you had these breaking situations going on to look at
                    the wire ticker, to look at the latest cable that came in not waiting for it to
                    be sent out to his office. Warren Christopher when he was Deputy Secretary,
                    Vance's deputy, especially on occasions when he was Acting, invariably called
                    the senior watch officer several times a night to see if there was just anything
                    he needed to know. Unnecessary in some ways because he would have been advised
                    if there was something he needed to know, but he liked to just call and chat to
                    see what was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Reassure himself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: The senior watch officers always keep a log about what was going on
                    and they would obviously log in a call from the Deputy Secretary and when I
                    reviewed those in the morning, he would often call to check and see what was
                    going on, party to reassure himself, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, most of the crises we talked about have been in the
                        Middle East and South Asia, but were there not things going on say in Latin
                        America? I recall this is the time of Somoza's overthrow in Nicaragua and we
                        were having problems in Salvador too.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>FLEISCHER: The whole Central America thing started back in those day. We
                    established a working group on a couple of those areas too. I can remember once
                    when ARA had suggested the establishment of a working group. We were using all
                    the available space in the Op Center so we kept one going in the ARA itself at
                    the time. But the great emphasis certainly during the period that I was on there
                    ... nothing compared to the Iranian and the Middle-East situation. Certainly the
                    attention of the Secretary and the Deputy Secretary was focused on these areas,
                    not on Central America. That came later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, when your tour in the Op Center ended, you moved to
                        ACTA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: Right. A friend of mine, Ambassador Chuck Flowerree, who recently
                    passed away, convinced me to come down to ACTA, told me that he needed a lot of
                    help; that there was going to be a review of the biological weapons agreement
                    going on and he convinced me to come down and work for him which I did for the
                    next couple of years, spending a lot of time in Geneva and a lot of time at the
                    UN in New York on disarmament matters. Again, an extremely fascinating period of
                    time when the Chinese had just become members of the Committee on Disarmament
                    which is the UN disarmament group which used to meet in Geneva.Dealing with the
                    Russians and Chinese on arms control and disarmament matters in those days was
                    interesting to say the least. Now the truth about a lot of the issues that we
                    dealt with in those days — including what we knew was an anthrax epidemic caused
                    by a biological weapons plant and of course stoutly denied by the Soviets - has
                    come out from official Soviet documents. We now know of course that indeed was
                    the case and some of that information since the break up of the Soviet Union has
                    become available. It was also my first experience dealing with UN bureaucracy
                    which I must say was not necessarily a pleasant one, spending hours, days,
                    months, weeks debating the meaning of words and sentences. I spent a lot of time
                    trying to negotiate a chemical weapons treaty for example, and the amount of
                    time that went in to these things when you look back on it is really
                    extraordinary. But I guess it all comes down in a sense to the willingness of
                    countries to take a step and to put a certain amount of faith in another
                    country. If you don't have that, no amount of haggling over a phrase or sentence
                    in a proposed chemical ban, for example, will lead to an agreement. Trust and
                    confidence, or at least the absence of strong mistrust, is really the key to
                    those kinds of issues. I think during that time we did make some progress. On
                    the other hand, those same issues are still being fought over today. Now the
                    nuclear non-proliferation treaty is very much on the front burner again. And it
                    looks as if a permanent treaty is not going to be possible.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>You know the assignment to ACTA, detail I guess properly speaking, was also very
                    interesting. ACDA has always been sort of a stepchild organization if you will
                    and recently Secretary Christopher had recommended the dissolution of ACTA and
                    incorporating its activities into the Department of State. Personally I think
                    that's probably a good idea. I don't know that you can argue that there's
                    necessarily any reason what amounts to a small independent establishment. There
                    are only about two hundred and fifty officers or something in ACTA and I think
                    it could function very well as part of the Department of State. As it was even
                    in those days we worked very closely with State. For example in this anthrax
                    thing came out before I flew over to Geneva I can remember working very closely
                    with office directors in PM who were very concerned about the same kinds of
                    issues. Another thing I remember very well about my tour with ACTA was finding
                    out first hand what an incredible bureaucracy the Pentagon is, I had never had
                    an assignment before, except the Op Center where we only dealt with NMCC, the
                    National Military Command Center, which was a very unbureaucratic focused part
                    of the Pentagon. But when you were dealing with arms control issues it was
                    another kettle of fish. I had the mistaken view that if you got a clearance from
                    JCS that that was it. Lo and behold, I learned that you couldn't even get a
                    clearance from JCS unless they in turn got clearances from the individual
                    services. I used to write speeches for the Ambassador, and as a matter of course
                    you clear those through the Pentagon. But they wanted to clear every comma and
                    every adjective. It's impossible to work that way and I found it extremely
                    frustrating until I was able to work out with the guy in the JCS that I worked
                    with. I said: “Look, as far as my understanding is, we clear ideas, I would
                    certainly clear language that was policy oriented language, but I'm not going to
                    waste time arguing about words and commas. So at least back here I was able to
                    work out with people at the JCS kind of ground rules for this sort of thing. But
                    you also had the same kind of problem then in Geneva. You're in Geneva and you
                    got a session going on and when we took a group over to Geneva for a meeting of
                    the committee there was always the JCS representative there and so you could
                    rely on him to clear things back home with whomever he thought he had to clear
                    them with. But again you would run into the trouble that somebody was speaking
                    in a certain committee meeting or something of disarmament group and they wanted
                    to clear what you were going to say. Well often you made interventions according
                    to the flow of the debate and you can't clear all that stuff ahead of time. So
                    anyway it was a new experience for me working with the Pentagon I must say
                    during that whole period of time. I think it's a valid argument that since
                    policy direction for ACTA is always given by the Secretary of State. If you look
                    on charts today you always see a dotted line out to the director of ACTA and it
                    probably makes sense to me at any rate to fold that in somehow into the
                    Department of State. Now in the real disarmament community, the NGO community
                    and what have you which has some influence in this administration with Gore and
                    others, there's a really real dug in resistance to that. They feel I think that
                    if that operation were just part of the overall State Department, that they
                    would no longer have what they would consider appropriate influence on policies.
                    They really were dug in a couple of years ago at the beginning of this
                    administration and it looks as if they may have won the battle again this time.
                    But with the end of the cold war those kinds of issues don't have the same
                    driving force behind them that they did before, so I think eventually that's
                    probably going to happen.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: Absolutely. It was a good experience in any case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now at the end of that experience, you went abroad again
                        and were given your own post</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: In fact to Latin America, this time to Venezuela as Principal Officer
                    in Maracaibo, which is the second largest city in Venezuela where all the oil
                    extraction takes place, and again that was an extremely interesting time. I
                    would guess that during that period of time I probably spent at least fifty
                    percent of my time on economic/commercial matters, trying to make sure that a
                    telephone company, (which was just in the beginning stage of thinking about
                    privatization), that US firms had a good opportunity to bid on components. I
                    organized the first ever oil show that we had in Venezuela. The first time that
                    was attempted, we worked with the Department of Commerce obviously. They're the
                    ones who put on these kinds of shows, and the people who do that are real
                    professionals I must say. It attracted huge contingents from the oil industry
                    obviously interested in selling products to the Venezuelan oil industry. After
                    the first go-round, we put maybe a two or three-day oil show, the US companies
                    got about sixty million dollars worth of business out of that the first time we
                    did it. So I was very happy about that and it's continued to this day. That's
                    one of the major oil shows around now, it's the one that was started in
                    Maracaibo some years ago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maracaibo is still open I take it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: Maracaibo is still open. There were attempts to close it a couple of
                    years ago. It was mostly because of commercial pressure that it was not. It will
                    probably be closed one of these days too. Except for a few very large consulates
                    general in western Europe, it looks as if the name of the game is going to close
                    almost all constituent posts and handle nearly everything out of the capital
                    cities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How large a staff do you have in Maracaibo?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>FLEISCHER: I had four other Americans and then the normal contingent of a local
                    staff. We had a very large USIS operation with a branch public affairs officer,
                    and a binational center. A very successful one. We had a couple of thousand
                    students studying English and all kinds of different activities that we had
                    going on that part of Venezuela. The interesting thing to me there again is to
                    emphasize how the economic interests of the United States have really come to
                    the forefront in recent years and probably the only valid reason for keeping a
                    post like Maracaibo open anymore is for economic/commercial as opposed to
                    political purposes. Political officers in Caracas can read the newspapers from
                    Maracaibo, can come down occasionally, talk to the governor, talk to the mayor,
                    talk to the political leaders, can come down during campaigns, etc. But the
                    thing that we'll miss when we close all those posts is the personal contact that
                    the Consul General or his staff has with the business community, with the top
                    managers in major enterprises around, so that if a businessman comes in off the
                    street, or you get a cable or telex or a message or whatever, and somebody from
                    Houston is coming and they're talking about multi-million dollar propositions
                    with the Venezuelan oil industry, if you're there, and you're living there, and
                    you're on the spot, and you know who to call, who to put the guy in contact
                    with, you got some rapport so you can introduce him, it's not a blind call from
                    Washington. I think it's too bad that those posts are going but I think it's
                    inevitable as the State Department has to cut down on costs as much as any other
                    department of the government, those are the first things that are going to go,
                    those kinds of operations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Unfortunately, I think you're right. Now you were there
                        during the Falklands war. Did that have any effect on your acceptance by the
                        Venezuelans? I know that throughout Latin America there were strong views on
                        that subject.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: Yes, there were. Not so much in Venezuela. It's interesting. If you
                    were in the southern cone, obviously Argentina, but even Paraguay or Uruguay, or
                    even as far away as Chile, I think there may have been more affect than there
                    was in Venezuela. I think the Venezuelans, although they're always Latin
                    American Nationalists and they like to have solidarity with other Latin American
                    countries on such issues, were far enough removed from any real personal
                    involvement as it didn't present any real kinds of difficulties for us in that
                    part of Venezuela or indeed I don't think even in Caracas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Those were also the years when oil prices were falling too
                        and Venezuela had run up a huge debt. That must have had some effect.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>FLEISCHER: That was probably the most interesting part, being in Venezuela at
                    this particular time. Even from a personal standpoint, when we went to Venezuela
                    there was a fixed exchange rate and the bolivar was just a little over four to
                    the dollar and that meant that it was very expensive to live there. It was
                    really an artificial exchange rate and that meant that things in dollar terms
                    were extremely expensive. We seldom bought anything on the Venezuelan market
                    beside food and that sort of thing, and we did go to restaurants and what have
                    you, but we didn't buy goods because they were extremely expensive in Venezuela.
                    On the other hand for the Venezuelans it was just the opposite... in terms of
                    visas for example. The problem for us, visa issuance at that post was not
                    weeding out who should or should not have visas that much at least as far as
                    Venezuelans were concerned. It was a production problem of getting the passport
                    in, actually physically stamping the visa in and getting them back to the
                    people. It was a pure production process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They weren't going to become public charges.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: The rate of people who abused that was extremely small. There were
                    many Venezuelans who would fly to Florida to do grocery shopping and fly back.
                    There were a lot of Venezuelans during that period of time who bought condos in
                    Florida with very little down and their monthly burden was not that great. Again
                    the exchange rate was very influential there. Now when the oil prices that you
                    talked about came up and the bolivar was devalued and quickly started falling,
                    very reminiscent of what's happening to the Mexican peso today, although the
                    bolivar never fell quite as low, then that was another story. Instead of a
                    tourist having only to use four hundred bolivars to get his hundred bucks to
                    spend in Miami, it was now double and three times that. So the number of Florida
                    condominiums for example, a lot of Venezuelans simply walked away from them.
                    They didn't have that much equity in them. They hadn't put that much down. They
                    could no longer afford to meet the dollar payments on those, so they walked
                    away. So there were any number in the Miami area especially in the Fort
                    Lauderdale, etc. inquiries that we would get, and the Venezuelans simply walked
                    away, ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just left what they had there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: Just left what they had there because they could no longer afford to
                    keep up with the payments. It also had a great effect on the work load in the
                    Consulate just in terms of the number of people no longer traveling. It had a
                    great effect on Pan American. Yes, Pan American was the airline which was still
                    in existence and served Maracaibo, cutting down on the number of direct flights.
                    Again these are all economic issues and again I think it serves to point up the
                    importance of the economic/commercial issues in the foreign service life today
                    and I think it was not the case when I entered the foreign service thirty years
                    ago.</p>

                        election I think in those years. They inaugurated President Lusinchi.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>FLEISCHER: You know all over Latin America, and also in Venezuela, we are used to
                    talking in those days about a real economic revolution taking place. There has
                    been an economic revolution. Central governments know that it's no longer
                    appropriate for central governments to have the kind of control that they used
                    to have over the economic systems of their country. But there has also been a
                    political revolution which has accompanied this and I think many people will
                    argue and perhaps correctly so that you can't have one without the other.
                    Venezuela has always very much been a two party state. Powers alternated between
                    one party and the other. Being in Maracaibo was interesting during this election
                    because Maracaibo was the hotbed of the opposition, not of Lusinchi's party. So
                    it was very interesting following political developments there. But since
                    Lusinchi's time, and Lusinchi by the way is still under a cloud of suspicion of
                    having benefited, himself and his family, economically during his position in
                    power. Since his successor from Accion Democratica which was their party, as you
                    know, was driven really from office again under a cloud of suspicion of having
                    enriched himself economically. Whether either one of them will ever come to
                    trial in Venezuela I don't really know. Carlos Andres Perez is still in
                    Venezuela. Lusinchi got out while the getting was good. As a matter of fact he
                    was living here in the United States. I don't know whether he's gone back to
                    Venezuela or not, but there was a great cloud of mistrust then brought about
                    both by the Lusinchi Administration and the administration of Perez, which led
                    to the recent election of the old man of Venezuelan Politics, Rafael Caldera who
                    is having a very difficult time. Venezuela is still better off than many
                    countries in Latin America because of the great amounts of oil reserves that
                    they have there. But there can be I think not much argument that Venezuela has
                    not managed that oil very well over the years. Other countries, Colombia for
                    example which has recently discovered fairly large deposits of oil, are
                    determined that they are going to learn from Venezuela's mistakes and not make
                    the same kinds of errors that Venezuelans have made in managing this huge amount
                    of resources. So Venezuela does have all of these oil resources to rely on, but
                    they are nevertheless ... And I think one of the things that they are going to
                    have to do as eventually the Mexicans are going to have to do and that is to
                    privatize those resources. This is still heresy certainly in Mexico even as a
                    result of the recent crisis in Mexico, we haven't heard the president of Mexico
                    say: “We're going to privatize PEMEX.” What he's going to have to do is work
                    around the edges of that and what I think they will probably start doing is
                    privatizing, let's say some of the petrochemical plants. In Venezuela, it's not
                    quite the same emotional issue as in Mexico. But you got some of the same kinds
                    of problems, so there again and I might add I think that everybody will agree
                    that the Venezuelan National Oil Company , PDVESA, has been better managed than
                    PEMEX. It used to be Esso, and Gulf, and the various other ones. They just gave
                    them different names but kept those separate identities so that there's a little
                    bit of competition between them. They've always been run by well-trained
                    managers. One thing that the Venezuelans did do was use some of their oil money
                    to send engineers to the States and get MBAs and advanced degrees, etc., so that
                    they have a very well trained group of people willing and able to do this. They
                    have not become an employer of last resort which has happened in Mexico, but
                    there has always been pressure to add friends of politicians to the payroll.
                    That has not happened quite so much in Venezuela. But it's still a tempting
                    target. It brings in a lot of money and Venezuelan politicians want to at least
                    tax that and use that in some way to benefit other areas. So eventually it seems
                    to me that that probably is going to be privatized in Venezuela, too. The money
                    that had been sort of flowing into Venezuela from outside for investments has
                    slowed down considerably because of fear that the economy is not as well managed
                    as say in Chile. And when there's competition from Chile, even in Argentina or
                    even in Brazil, with all the difficulty that Brazil has had, Venezuela has found
                    itself in the position of having to make very severe adjustments economically.
                    Selling off state enterprises which grew up almost willy-nilly whereas everybody
                    agrees that there's probably no reason for the central government to own a hotel
                    on the beach, for example, to say nothing of aluminum plants, or steel plants.
                    So all of those I think will eventually go on the auction block. I think
                    Venezuela is one of the countries in Latin America which probably still has a
                    pretty good future. They have made considerable changes in the last ten
                    years.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were in Maracaibo, were you concerned about
                        terrorism or drug trafficking and some of the problems that have grown up in
                        recent years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: Yes. Most of those have really come up since we lived there. We were
                    concerned I guess, we had private guards at the residence and were careful about
                    things like that. We did not have marines at the Consulate. We had a private
                    security staff and I guess the local police gave us a couple of people out in
                    front. The drug business was really just beginning at the time we were almost
                    leaving Venezuela. It was much more evident at that period of time in Colombia.
                    It was also a problem in the Guajiran peninsula which is that peninsula, almost
                    a no-man's land between Colombia and Venezuela leading up to the gulf. I wanted
                    to drive across that peninsula into Colombia and the State Department security
                    officers in Bogota and Caracas would not hear of it. That had become sort of a
                    no-man's land where automobiles were stolen, let's say in Maracaibo. Venezuela
                    was economically a little better off than Colombia at the time we were living
                    there. They would end up in the Guajiro. Numbers would be erased, they'd be
                    changed, etc. and before you'd know it, they're in Colombia and being driven by
                    somebody else. There were bands of terrorists there, etc. but we were never
                    really too concerned about our children. We had a very large American school
                    there, because there were a lot of Americans associated with the oil industries
                    there. A lot of US companies had set up operations there partly because the
                    Venezuelans required it, for example, which sold a lot of equipment. Other
                    manufacturing companies which sold to the Venezuelan oil industry and often
                    established their local manufacturing facilities in Maracaibo in order to better
                    serve the oil industry. So there were never really any serious problems I would
                    say connected with either drug trafficking or pure violence and terrorism.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>FLEISCHER: Yes. I didn't particularly like the hot weather, but they liked to
                    come down to Maracaibo. They were very sophisticated and very knowledgeable
                    people. So both ambassadors used to come down quite a bit. Both superb career
                    professionals, I must say. I later worked for George again in another capacity
                    after I left the Foreign Service. He became president of the Council of the
                    Americas which is an association of a couple of hundred large U.S. corporations,
                    mostly Fortune 500 companies that have a lot of connections in Latin America and
                    I spent five years there working for them then in their Washington office after
                    I left the Foreign Service</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, when your period in Maracaibo ended you came to the
                        US mission of the OAS where you and I worked together under Ambassador
                        Middendorf and you stayed on with Ambassador McCormack.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: That's right, yes. Now again we have two non-career ambassadors, both
                    of whom had different kinds of strength. In Bill Middendorf's case, he was an
                    experienced Washington hand having been Secretary of the Navy, etc., Ambassador
                    to the Netherlands, so he knew Washington very, very well. It made it
                    interesting I know for you and also for me. It also made it very difficult in
                    some instances that I can remember. And Bill would get bored with what was going
                    on. He always wanted to do something else. It was not unusual for him to drop by
                    the office and say: “Look, come on let's go.” And you'd find yourself sitting in
                    Fred Eklay's office over in the Pentagon, expected to be discussing you didn't
                    know what because you had no idea why Bill was taking you over there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Amen.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: So it was a very interesting period of time. I liked both guys very
                    much I must say. I'm not sure given the attitude of most Latin Americans however
                    that that is a post to have a non-career ambassador in. Now I'm arguing against
                    what I argued against some time back in our discussion where I thought I'd
                    worked for a couple of non-career ambassadors that I thought in particular
                    situations were extremely effective. I think both Middendorf and McCormack did
                    fine in that atmosphere. I think neither one of them however spoke Spanish.
                    Neither one of them until their posting there had a lot of Latin American
                    experience in dealing with all of these old-time Latin American ambassadors
                    which is the kind of person you usually have representing the countries, fairly
                    senior men. I think maybe it would have been easier for them had they had more
                    Latin American background.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Agree, agree heartily. What were some of these principal
                        issues that you had to deal with there as political counselor?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>FLEISCHER: One of the things that I remember most vividly and that I think exists
                    to this day, and is probably doing a very good job at the OAS, was when we
                    established ... got the OAS into the drug business. I should put that a little
                    better I guess. Really got the OAS into the anti-drug trafficking business. Up
                    until that time the OAS ... This has not been a subject with the OAS at all. If
                    you talk to our friend, Irv Tragen, who still runs that operation down at the
                    OAS I think he would tell you that one of the most productive things we ever got
                    into was to establish an inter-American anti-drug council, get the governments
                    together discussing and helping them financially to talk to one another so that
                    each time a new drug problem came up in Venezuela that had already been dealt
                    with in Colombia, I mean, they weren't reinventing the wheel. That has been a
                    very successful operation and that kind of started when we were there. The most
                    frustrating part at the time I was there was the whole Central American
                    imbroglio where the OAS was only really tangentially involved in a way but
                    nevertheless it influenced a lot of things that we did there and I think
                    influenced them not to the good. The Latins themselves were not comfortable
                    dealing with Central American issues in the OAS because they still felt the
                    dominating position of the United States. So they formed their on Contadora
                    Group and operated outside of the inner-American system where they were on their
                    own and not have to then deal with the United States. But then in other things
                    that the OAS was involved in those days, the Central American issues seemed to
                    be impeding and keeping you from making progress in other kinds of areas. One of
                    the things that I think we were never able to accomplish when we were there was
                    to get the OAS really more involved in trade and economic issues. Most of the
                    ambassadors named to the organization who served on the permanent council were
                    more comfortable talking about political issues, and prepared to talk about
                    political issues ad nauseam, but they weren't ready to give the same kind of
                    time and attention and leadership to American economic sort of issues. I think
                    that this was after you had left but it's a time when Dick McCormack was there,
                    who was very interested in economic issues. He'd been Assistant Secretary of
                    State for Business and Economic Affairs. Later went on to become Under Secretary
                    for economic issues in the Department of State. Dick was very interested in
                    economic issues and we tried our darndest to get the OAS more involved in coming
                    trade issues that I think a lot of people saw coming along. The free trade
                    agreements, sharing of information, but we were never really able to pull that
                    off. Ambassador Bob Sayer worked with us for quite a while trying to get the OAS
                    interested in those things. Now I think with the election of Cesar Gaviria, the
                    former president of Colombia who is very interested in the free trade kinds of
                    issues ... The OAS got very interested in that kind of issues, the negotiations
                    of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Now if we are to go on and discuss
                    seriously as the presidents all agreed at the summit of the Americas last
                    December in Miami that we ought to work in this hemisphere toward a really free
                    trade agreement for the whole hemisphere. I think the OAS will get more
                    involved. But when you and I were there, they really didn't want to get involved
                    in that. I think since we were there the organization has also made progress in
                    becoming more involved in elections kind of issues on a non-partisan kind of
                    level, sending observers in. There is now a so-called democracy unit in the OAS
                    which is more involved in these kinds of issues. The whole concept in promoting
                    democracy in Latin America was at the forefront of the founding of the
                    Organization of American States, but in the time when the countries were under
                    the rule of military government and dictatorships and what have you that was
                    never an issue that was very easy to talk about. Now at the time when all the
                    members of the Organization of American States are democratically elected
                    governments it is much easier to deal with those kinds of issues.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that it was difficult to get your views or
                        OAS views considered in the Department in the various areas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: Absolutely. The truth of the matter is US Mission to the OAS which is
                    physically located in the Department of State near ARA frontal office has always
                    been a stepchild. In some ways the US ambassador to the OAS outranks its
                    Secretary even who in a sense is his boss really, takes orders from him but
                    outranks him. This was a problem between Bill Middendorf and Elliott Abrams I
                    know a lot of times. When Bill was sometimes invited to things or head of a
                    delegation and Abrams as a mere Assistant Secretary was down the totem pole. The
                    only time in my experience there in three years as a political counselor was
                    when the front office of ARA was really interested in what was going on at the
                    OAS was if the decision was made that somehow we needed a cover of
                    multilateralism for whatever it was that the ARA front office was doing.
                    Otherwise there was no real interest in what was going on. I don't think, and
                    this is something that has been debated for years and probably will continue to
                    be debated for years and that is whether the Organization of American States
                    really fits into the policy picture. We're talking about US policy toward Latin
                    America. There are times where it seems to and now we seem to be on the upswing
                    where this administration at any rate has tasked the OAS with certain functions
                    with regard to developing issues for a pre-trade agreement for the Americas that
                    we're talking about. So it seems to be back on the increase again. The pendulum
                    has turned. But at the time that we were there, in any of the three years that I
                    spent there, I can't honestly say that the front office of Inter-American
                    Affairs in the Department of State was really very interested in what was going
                    on. It was always a task for instance if we were having the annual meeting of
                    the Organization of American States, the general assembly meeting wherever it
                    was held. If it was being held in Washington, it wasn't too bad. You could
                    usually get the Secretary, or if his calendar was really filled up, the Deputy
                    Secretary to come and make a speech and be the nominal head of the delegation.
                    If it was a matter of taking the Secretary to Rio, which we did one year ...
                    George Shultz I remember ... I guess this was maybe after you were gone, Tom,
                    but we got George Shultz to head the delegation and he did come down to Rio and
                    spent at least twenty-four hours. But that was a major effort to convince his
                    staff, to convince the front office of ARA that it was worth them expending
                    political capital on the seventh floor to get the Secretary to do that. That was
                    a major undertaking. Shultz did do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, following your tour there, you moved in to the
                        inspection corps for a period.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>FLEISCHER: Yes, I went to the inspection corps for a good year and a half or so I
                    guess before I finally left the Foreign Service. Again that was an interesting
                    experience for me. And this is still an issue today whether in effect the
                    Foreign Service ought to inspect itself. There is now independent foreign
                    service inspectors. When I first went to the inspection corps, Bill Harrop was
                    the Inspector General. Career Foreign Service Officer, now the ambassador again
                    some place in Africa, where is it? Kenya maybe?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sorry, I've forgotten.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: I think maybe he's in Kenya now. But be that as it may, the Inspector
                    General was a career Foreign Service officer. Jesse Helms always thought that
                    was not the way things ought to be and I guess it was Jesse who really forced
                    the Department finally to name an outside Inspector General. It is delicate in a
                    way. I mean, here you are, you are a Foreign Service inspector and you're going
                    out to inspect your colleagues, people you know quite well. You're inspecting
                    your friends. That's always been I think a conflict, and you look back through,
                    not wanting to really ... unless you had an egregiously badly-run post, and you
                    had no choice, you were going to get some backing from the State Department in
                    some way, it was almost foolish to write a nasty inspection report on some
                    ambassador or something. I always felt that the most useful thing you could do
                    as an inspector was informal kind of counseling and that didn't necessarily get
                    in the report, or if it did it got in a way that wasn't going necessarily blight
                    somebody's career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had to listen. It was important to listen to
                        people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: Absolutely. I think I won't name the post because people there are
                    still really active in the Foreign Service now, and there's really no reason to
                    do that. The point is that I remember inspecting a post talking to the political
                    section and everybody was extremely unhappy over the political counselor. They
                    liked him, but felt that he was not letting them in on things. Well. I happen to
                    know that political counselor from other posts and during the time, for weeks or
                    a month that I was at that post inspecting I spent all the time talking with him
                    about what his staff was telling me, and trying to give him suggestions of ways
                    I thought he could improve his operation that would make everybody happy or ...
                    I guess one of the recommendations that I made in the final report had something
                    to do with that but it was phrased in a way that wasn't going to get anybody's
                    nose really out of joint. But I do think that that whole section, the operation
                    of that embassy, and certainly of that individual benefited from that kind of
                    exchange which he and I had, and his staff and I had during the period of that
                    inspection. And I think he did change the way he operated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's what I wanted to ask. Did it have an effect?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>FLEISCHER: Yes. Well I knew some of the staff and I followed up on it in other
                    years, and he is still ... That section chief is in a very good position to
                    influence policy in Latin America and I think probably doing a fairly good job
                    of it. I'm not saying that I am responsible for that, but I do think that in the
                    operation of that embassy we did make some headway and that's just one example
                    of it. It seems to me that that's the kind of thing that an inspection corps can
                    do where colleague to colleague is probably very useful.</p>
                <p>...at least when it comes to inspecting the Admin. Section let's say of an
                    embassy which I think can more properly be termed an audit where we really are
                    going over the books and checking on malfeasance, property, and big supplies.
                    That can probably be done by an outside group of auditors who'd come in and do
                    that. That makes sense to me. There's no reason to have necessarily foreign
                    service officers going out and auditing books. So I think that's probably what
                    the inspection corps is evolving into. You do need high-ranking... probably some
                    ex-ambassadors to head teams to go down, to have them report to ambassadors. But
                    it was a good experience for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think the inspections are chiefly of advantage to
                        the Department or to the post?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: To both but for different reasons. I think the Department needs to
                    have an audit done. The Department needs to know whether an admin. officer some
                    place ... whether they're using US government funds the way they should be used,
                    etc. I think that's valuable for the Department. For the other operations of the
                    post, to inspect the political section or the economic section or what have you,
                    it's the posts that probably benefit most. I can't imagine of all the reports I
                    wrote which are probably gathering dust some place in the Department of State
                    that that really changed the way the Department of State is operating in any
                    shape or form. But I do think that posts benefit by just having somebody from
                    the outside come in when there are conflicts at posts among senior officers by
                    coming in from the outside, colleague to colleague basis, I think there are ways
                    that you can try to help that situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So in summing up I think you'd say that the inspection
                        corps is still germane.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: Oh absolutely. I think it really is germane to the whole function of
                    the foreign service. I think probably Helms in the long run was probably right,
                    that the Inspector General should probably not be a career foreign service
                    officer. There's an inherent conflict of interest there somehow. And that when
                    you're talking about malfeasance and wasting taxpayers' funds and that kind of
                    thing on that side of the ledger I think you really need an independent
                    inspector general. That independent inspector general mind you still needs some
                    foreign service officers on the staff to do the kind of counseling and mediating
                    and that sort of thing, but I think it has been fairly ...</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think you put it fairly well, because to have only
                        outsiders would be very difficult since they have to be educated at great
                        length.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: I think that's absolutely correct. That's absolutely right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, following your period in the inspection corps
                        you decided to retire I gather.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: I left the foreign service after that for lots of reasons. One was, I
                    was coming up against a time in grade which I saw coming and I really didn't
                    think I was going to be promoted the following year. There were all kinds of
                    FSO-1s waiting. It seemed to me that you could very easily see the handwriting
                    on the wall, that those ones who were going to be promoted were those who were
                    in an embassy abroad or were involved in some policy issue in the Department
                    that gave them some reason to be differentiated from the herd.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What you mean is that they were in a visible
                        position.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: That's exactly correct. In some ways that was just the luck of the
                    draw. They happened to be there at the time when something was going on that
                    gave them visibility. That's one of the things I suppose that doesn't make sense
                    about our type of class, type of grading kind of system. But I think you could
                    see that. That was obvious to me. It was a time when a former ambassador I'd
                    worked for I think I mentioned George Landau retired, had just been named
                    president of the Council of the Americas. I had conversations with him and one
                    thing led to another and I knew that I had some place to go and that made the
                    decision much easier to make. I don't regret the decision at all. Those years I
                    spent working for the Council of the Americas issues of Latin America I think
                    were interesting years for me and I enjoyed them. Since I left there I've been
                    spending my time writing and doing projects for the Center of Strategic
                    International Studies and for some other people ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Including this very nice pamphlet “Colombian policy in the
                        mid-''90s” that you let me have.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: Which I'm still doing and still enjoying. There are certain things
                    about the foreign service that I miss. I think living abroad is certainly one of
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the camaraderie of the people you were with.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: That kind of thing you can miss.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Absolutely.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: What I don't miss is the rigid Department bureaucracy, fighting
                    battles that you can never win just because it's the system. That kind of thing
                    I certainly don't miss in the Department of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, looking back on your career, are there changes that
                        you would suggest in the way the service is now run?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: Well, yes. I mean I suppose you can't talk to anybody who is no longer
                    there who doesn't have some suggestions to make. I think to give the foreign
                    service credit, it has been changing. A couple of years ago when I was still
                    involved with the Council of the Americas, I started conversations with the
                    director of FSI for example about what I thought I had seen on my trips around
                    Latin America as a non-FSO and somebody dealing with the business community and
                    changes I thought should be made in the training of economic and commercial
                    officers abroad. The director of FSI agreed and got a working group going with
                    some real business people on it and I kind of lost track of that in the last
                    year about what happened. But everybody agreed that there needed to be some
                    changes and some more emphasis put on that kind of thing and I think that has
                    obviously been done. So that's certainly one of the things that came to me. With
                    the shrinking of government, the shrinking of the Department of State, the
                    inevitable shrinking of the foreign service, we have to I think reevaluate some
                    of our long-held dogmatic beliefs and I got into this somewhat when I was in the
                    inspection corps yet, when we were developing a model small embassy for example.
                    You no longer are going to be able to have in every small country in the world,
                    and ambassador, a DCM, or section chief of a big section. That's just not going
                    to work that way anymore. So we have to have to find new ways of working so that
                    we have some kind of personal representation there. But a much more efficient
                    kind of operation where every ambassador ... probably if the truth be known we
                    don't need an ambassador accredited to every country even. We can have an
                    ambassador resident someplace and be accredited to several countries and that
                    happened. If the truth be known, we probably don't even need an embassy in every
                    country. But these are all matters that are going to take a long time to change
                    because, one, the prestige of a country becomes involved, and so those kinds of
                    things are not going to be easy to implement. On personnel matters I don't think
                    we have still come to grips with how to deal with this kind of class problem
                    where a very large number of FSO-1s are still being forced out of the
                    service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With excellent records.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>FLEISCHER: Because there is no place for them to work. Yes, with excellent
                    records, sometimes even with backgrounds, experience that are unique, that the
                    Department and the foreign service are going to miss. We haven't really found
                    out how to deal with that yet. Hopefully we will one of these days. Now the
                    concept of up and out in theory and in general is probably not a bad concept. We
                    do need a constant flow of new people in or you're going to be caught in some
                    situation some years down the line that's probably going to be as bad as the one
                    which developed a couple of years ago that is crowding us all at the top, but I
                    don't know that we have figured out how to do that yet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, we'll be tinkering with this system for the next fifty
                        years I'm afraid Lowell.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: Undoubtedly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now to sum up would you recommend to young people today
                        that they enter the foreign service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLEISCHER: Now that is really a very good question because it is one that I have
                    been discussing with my son who is a sophomore in college and who maybe is
                    interested in this kind of thing. I don't think I would hesitate to recommend
                    that. Yes. But it's like everything else these days. The change of work place
                    and this. I am not sure anymore that you enter as an FSO, I don't even know what
                    it is these days, the numbers, but at the bottom level with the idea of
                    necessarily spending twenty or thirty years there. I think there are people who
                    are going to do that and I think they will continue to have very good careers.
                    The way the workplace is changing I think there are people who are probably
                    going to enter, spend ten years, half a dozen years, fifteen I don't know, and
                    they will probably leave and have productive careers somewhere else. I think
                    we're going to see that more and more. But I think that if my son Michael wanted
                    to do that and we've sat and talked seriously about it, I would recommend that
                    he do it. I think there's nothing like living abroad, getting to know people in
                    another society, getting to know well another language, somehow trying to
                    interpret all of that to people back home I think is interesting, more than
                    interesting .I think it's invaluable in that no matter how speedily our
                    communications become and a desk officer back here can pick up a telephone or
                    touch a computer key and be in instant contact someplace else. You're still
                    going to need somebody there it seems to me serving a function that I've
                    described is kind of comforting what's going on back home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well thank you very much Lowell. This has been extremely
                        interesting. You've had a career that I think is as exciting as most people
                        have had. You have had interesting posts and met people who made
                        history.</hi>
