                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 5th of November 2008. We have just seen the
                        election of Barack Obama and this is an interview with Edward Kloth. This is
                        being done on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training
                        and I am Charles Stuart Kennedy. You go by Ted, is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay Ted, let's start at the beginning. When and where
                        were you born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: I was born on January 21, 1947 in Cherry Point, North Carolina, at the
                    Marine Air Base.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go over on your father's side first. What do you
                        know about the Kloth family, where do they come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Okay, well, the Kloth side of the house is of German ancestry. My mother
                    was born and raised in Buffalo, New York. Her side of the family immigrated from
                    England in the 18th and 19th centuries. A number had come via Canada.</p>
                <p>My father was a psychiatrist, born and raised in Brooklyn. He lived almost all
                    his life around New York City. He went to Columbia University and Columbia's
                    medical school, graduating in the spring of 1941. He joined the Navy and was on
                    two small aircraft carriers in the Pacific, the Marcus Islands and the Belleau
                    Wood. He was in a number of key battles including, I believe, Guadalcanal and
                    Leyte Gulf.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he one of the “Taffies” at Leyte?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>KLOTH: Yes, his carrier was bracketed by gunfire from a Japanese battleship, one
                    in front and one behind, the third on target never came.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever read the book The Last Charge of the Tin Can
                        Sailors? It's a wonderful book. It talks about the destroyers and the jeep
                        carriers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Well, I gather that the key to the action was that, while the major
                    American fleet had gone north looking for the Japanese fleet, a smaller force,
                    the largest ship may have been a cruiser, was left behind to cover the landings.
                    When the Japanese fleet suddenly appeared, the admiral ordered his ships to turn
                    and head toward the more powerful Japanese force. He also ordered the aircraft
                    to attack with, in some cases, just machine guns, of no use against battleships
                    and cruisers. The Japanese admiral then assumed that there must be a large
                    American force just over the horizon ad withdrew.</p>
                <p>There is a point here that I would like to make too because I later spent so much
                    time in Korea and Japan. My father had been there, so I was aware of the Pacific
                    as a kid. My father always emphasized that things like atrocities or some of the
                    ferocious behavior of the Japanese, including suicide before surrender, had to
                    be understood first and foremost as a result of what war does to people who
                    fight it. He reminded me that Americans too could be brutal under wartime
                    conditions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Belleau Wood took some hits didn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: He had two very close calls when kamikazes attacked his ship. He also
                    visited Japan shortly after the surrender; his carrier was sent to Tokyo Bay
                    after the surrender. He went on shore at least twice, Tokyo and Yokosuka. One of
                    the things that he emphasized was that when the Navy took them ashore to Tokyo,
                    he and his shipmates were, of course, worried about security. He had seen
                    sailors killed by kamikazes. He'd been ashore and seen the Marines who had been
                    in ferocious action on Guadalcanal. He'd seen Japanese soldiers who'd killed
                    themselves rather than surrender. In Tokyo, however, he found the Japanese very
                    polite and friendly.</p>
                <p>The other point he made was his impression that the U.S. military authorities did
                    not bring the GIs ashore with gloating in mind or “this is what we do to people
                    who cross us,” but rather in the spirit of: we had to do this terrible thing or
                    this might have happened to our cities. You'll recall the pictures of Tokyo
                    after the fire bomb raids. It was flattened. The atomic bombs were a terrible
                    weapon, so much destruction from one bomb, but the death and destruction from
                    the fire bomb raids was horrendous. When I served at our consulate in Fukuoka in
                    the mid-eighties, I met older Japanese who still couldn't forget the terror of
                    the bombing of that city.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's interesting as one looks at this. I am old enough to
                        remember this, although I was a kid but I grew up in Annapolis. Very quickly
                        there wasn't the hatred of the Japanese. The British carried it much longer
                        than the Americans did because we didn't lose an empire and, while we had
                        the Bataan death march and all that, we still didn't have the huge
                        humiliation of Singapore and all that came afterwards.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Right, I think the Australians of that generation too, particularly those
                    who fought in places like the jungles in New Guinea, had feelings that remained
                    very strong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know I occupied Japan for a very short time, and then
                        all of a sudden I was protecting Japan. They signed a peace treaty.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Where did your father meet your mother?</p>
                <p>KLOTH: I'm not sure exactly but some time during the war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your mother graduate from college?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: After they were married, Dad went to sea, and she did her BA at Barnard
                    College in New York.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And your father when he came back from the war was he a
                        doctor at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Yes, he decided to specialize in psychiatry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have brothers or sisters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: I have a sister and a bother. My sister's married to a doctor. They lived
                    most of their lives up in Maine and are now in eastern Maryland. My brother
                    graduated from the Naval Academy in '75, served five years in the Navy, and then
                    joined Merrill Lynch. He now runs Merrill Lynch operation up in Grand
                    Rapids.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a little about growing up with a psychiatrist
                        as a father. I mean would he sit at the table and say I know why you did
                        that or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>KLOTH: No, not at all. Actually growing up sort of prepared me for living with
                    classified information in government. In a doctor's family, it was a very, very
                    hard rule that you don't talk about patients at home. Occasionally, he would
                    mention some incident, but not in any way you could identify a patient. There
                    was no sense, I think, that any of us had growing up that we were continually on
                    the couch.</p>
                <p>Let me mention too though before we move on that my maternal grandmother actually
                    also had a significant impact on my interest in foreign affairs. She and my
                    grandfather split up in the '30s, and during World War II she volunteered as a
                    nurse's aid for the Red Cross in the South Pacific; in fact, she and my father
                    met on Guadalcanal. When the war was over, she went back to the South Pacific
                    and spent years traveling around. She went around on freighters; at that time
                    freighters would take passengers. She also moved around on an inter-island
                    sailing schooner.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Quite a life.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: ...and doing pen and ink drawings. She wound up in the early '50s in a
                    place called Umbala, at least that is what I remember it as, India, at a
                    missionary leprosy hospital, and stayed there for some years. As a kid at
                    Christmas, we would get boxes from India with all kinds of neat things with
                    wonderful smells from the wood: writing boxes with doors and the little shelves
                    beautifully carved with trees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Often sandalwood.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: There would be little peas with fifty hand carved ivory elephants in it;
                    things like that. But the wood smell stands out most.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even as you talk I can think of particularly the
                        sandalwood but other types of wood smells.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Nana came back in the late '50s, as she said once “die.” She wasn't in ill
                    health, but she just felt that the stress of living abroad in the manner in
                    which she was...she traveled all over India where she would put on a sari and
                    Indian garb and travel around third class on trains. She delighted in telling me
                    how she would eat little things that the street vendors were selling, etc.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>I was interested in the Far East, rather than India, for some reason. My junior
                    year in college I decided I'd see how I liked living abroad. We didn't have all
                    the study abroad programs then, so between my junior and senior years, I went to
                    Mexico and built outhouses with a college group in a very poor brick-making area
                    of Mexico City. I figured if I didn't like living there, I won't like countries
                    as different as those of Asia. We lived with middle class families, so it was
                    not that much of a hardship, but the people in the area where we worked
                    certainly had it tough.</p>
                <p>Before I left, I remember my father saying, “You've heard Nana's stories about
                    eating little this and that from the street vendors, etc., but I also remember
                    the story of her having to go up to the hill station for six months to recover
                    from this or that that she contracted.”</p>
                <p>I've followed his advice ever since and enjoyed living and eating abroad. “It
                    isn't hard. Be smart about what you put in your mouth. Most stuff, if you cook
                    it, it may go right through you, but it won't stay with you.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well again were you much of a reader? I'm thinking a Jack
                        London book that probably would have grabbed you as Tales in the South
                        Pacific.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: I was a great reader of history, particularly U.S. history. My father's
                    and grandmother's experiences peaked my interest in non-Western things too. I
                    went to boarding school in Connecticut, Choate School. I was president of the
                    current history club, and took the school's first non-Western history and
                    civilization class. That really started my interest in the Far East.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to go back to the elementary school and that time.
                        Do you recall any books that particularly interested you or type of books or
                        specific books as a kid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: I read Treasure Island, Mutiny on the Bounty, Kon-Tiki, Seven Years in
                    Tibet, those kinds of books.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you grow up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: I grew up around Yonkers, New York, near New York City in the 1950s. It
                    was a single-family residential neighborhood; houses in the '20s and '30s, I
                    think. I walked to primary school because it was close.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the neighborhood like? Was it middle class
                        or...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>KLOTH: Most of the people were professionals or business people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about being a boy in the area? What did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Played with friends in the afternoon and ran around. We'd come home from
                    school. Up through sixth grade I don't recall much homework at PS (Public
                    School) 8. I was a Cub Scout and then Boy Scout.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's somewhat different today where the children are
                        terribly organized. I mean I grew up, and we were sort of feral. Your mother
                        would say, “Get out of the house.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Same experience. We got out of the house until Mom rang a big brass bell
                    at 5:30 for dinner, and we were there quick. Living near New York, our parents
                    were concerned about safety, but in our neighborhood we could run around. The
                    rule of thumb was that it was OK as long as you were close enough to hear the
                    dinner bell.</p>
                <p>One friend got into theater at school. He was a couple of grades ahead, and would
                    write scripts and record musical backgrounds for a little puppet theater we
                    started together. His father was the minister at our church, and my friend would
                    borrow the church tape recorder. I joined as his apprentice, and we'd put on
                    puppet shows for the kids in the neighborhood. I guess that was fifth or sixth
                    grade. But when I got to junior high myself, I was more interested in current
                    affairs than theater.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your elementary school like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Public School # 8 was full of us baby boomer kids. Yonkers was struggling
                    to keep up with the influx. We had thirty and forty in a class. Too big,
                    everyone said.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much in the way of diversity? Were the kids
                        pretty much white, middle-class?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Yeah, they were white, and a mix of working and middle-class kids.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any sort of division in the Catholic, Jews and
                        non-Catholics, non-Jews or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>KLOTH: I think people were certainly conscious and aware of that, but for us
                    kids, I don't recall any jibes in school. Growing up around New York you knew a
                    mix of people. When I finished sixth grade and would have gone to a consolidated
                    junior high school, my parents had some concerns about safety in the new school
                    which included some rougher areas of town. They were also concerned about
                    quality of education. My parents send me to a private school in New York City,
                    so I took a school bus back and forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the private school like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: It was Riverdale Country Day School. They had a few boarders but mostly
                    not. So there in terms of the mix, the mix was more New York City in terms of
                    the ethnic backgrounds, including some children of UN officials, so we had some
                    “foreign” students. Most students lived in New York City, so my guess was in
                    terms of income level many were from higher levels than the kids where I was. I
                    kept up with some of my PS 8 friends. The work was a lot harder at Riverdale
                    both because of the jump to middle school but also because the private schools
                    loaded on more homework. I got a bus around 7:15 or so as I recall, went to
                    school, got home perhaps between 4:30 and 5:00pm, ate and started homework
                    turning in around 9:30.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we are sort of up through junior high were you able
                        to partake in the richness of New York City?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: In grade school, my parents often took us into the museums in New York.
                    The Museum of Natural History and the Cloisters were my favorites. But from
                    eighth grade, my parents started lengthening the leash. The really big deal was
                    being allowed to go into the city by train with a friend and no adult escort in
                    eighth grade on a Saturday afternoon; that was a big deal. We had to be on the
                    train back by 5pm, of course. The first time I sat through the overseas security
                    briefing, I realized I heard it first from my parents before I went in “the
                    city,” - “don't flash your money around; know where you're going; don't look
                    lost, even if you are; don't walk away from your backpack or it will disappear;
                    be aware of what's happening around you!”</p>
                <p>At Riverdale we often had ambassadors, judges and professors come and speak.
                    Eleanor Roosevelt talked to our assembly once.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about at this country day school what sort of subjects

                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: History was the one that interested me most, although I did well in
                    biology and English. My math was okay, but history was what I enjoyed.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of history were you getting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Well, standard fare for the times, the fifties, — U.S. and European; that
                    was really it. We had a geography course, and that was apparently to give us a
                    more global perspective. I don't recall any non-European or even Latin American
                    history. I think that was a sign of the times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that period did you get any feel for the Cold War?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Yes, we all knew it was there. I remember in PS 8 we would have air raid
                    drills and duck under the desk or go out in the hall. I was on the safety
                    patrol, so we were part of the enforcerdon't run down the stairs during fire
                    drills; don't talk during air raid drills. But I don't recall living under any
                    particular dread of being nuked; I mean when we had a fire drill, we went to the
                    playground and counted off. Air raid drill meant under the desk or into the
                    hall. As I remember, we'd try to guess from the teacher's behavior on a given
                    day which it would be. In the winter, for example, teacher's coat on the
                    bookshelf meant fire drill, because we'd be going outside.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was TV very important?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: We had a TV from when I was four or five, I suppose. We had designated TV
                    time. From junior high not much weekday TV allowed, though. With what was on in
                    the '50s, our parents weren't concerned about R ratings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about movies? Were you much of a movie fan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Well, in elementary school there was the Saturday matinee and we went
                    maybe every two or three months. It was a treat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the way, politically where did your family fall?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: They were Eisenhower Republicans; but they were not politically
                    active.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And religiously?</hi>
                </p>

                    religious.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were at Choate from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: I was there from '61 to '64.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well let's talk a bit about prep school. I'm a prep school
                        alumnus I went to Kent. We used to play Choate. What was Choate like in your
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Well, it had moved away from the pre-World War II formality but was still
                    coats and ties for classes. Smoking was absolutely forbidden. First of all, so
                    that a dorm and its occupants wouldn't get torched. No “butt room” either where
                    students could light up. The headmaster thought them unsightly. Don't recall
                    anyone saying the issue was health related, although by the early Sixties the
                    tobacco companies were under fire. Coming from Riverdale I didn't find the work
                    harder; it was the same. The student body at Choate was probably more white
                    Protestant than at Riverdale with its location in New York. I did have the
                    impression when I arrived at Choate, however, that the school was making an
                    effort to recruit a more diverse student body, but at a New England prep school
                    in the early Sixties that could mean getting a student from Denver as much as
                    anything else.</p>
                <p>Every student at Choate had to do work crew. My first semester I was on the
                    dishwashing crew. As the new guy I had to carry twelve plates hot and damp from
                    the dish dryer, and put them on the storage shelves. We wore gloves and an
                    apron, but one or two stacks, and you were wet, and your fingers raw.</p>
                <p>Rank hath its privilege, though. The next year my duties were lighter. Put the by
                    then room-temperature stacks in a cart, and roll them out to the tables. Work at
                    your own pace. Of course, the faster you went, the sooner you finished. Senior
                    year it was mail room clerk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know we did the same thing. How about your courses? Did
                        you continue with the love of history and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: I liked history very much. For my extracurricular I did current history
                    club and debating. We had speakers come for the history club. Choate's an hour
                    and a half by train from New York, so we'd get people from the UN or
                    politicians. Supreme Court Justice William Douglas came. If we didn't have a
                    speaker, we would get together and discuss a topic in the newspapers. The
                    faculty advisor was an English teacher. He decided that because the only history
                    offered was U.S. and European, he'd offer a course in non-Western history in my
                    senior year. We did Latin America, Africa, the Indian sub-continent and the Far
                    East. That's when I really got interested in East Asia.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Cuban missile crisis hit you all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Well, very much in terms of the drama of it. John Kennedy had gone to
                    Choate, so there was a special affinity at the school when he came in, though I
                    guess many alumni had probably voted Republican. I think the headmaster and
                    faculty probably thought we were going to war. I remember that at one point
                    President Kennedy had addressed or was about to address the nation. Our
                    headmaster's talk to us at chapel, where we had “assembly” every night, that
                    night certainly had a tone to it I'll never forget. He knew people who'd been
                    sitting before him not too many years before who were in the service. He was
                    probably concerned too about nuclear war. The atmosphere was pretty
                    electric.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also the assassination of the present Kennedy being a
                        Choate boy, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: That was also very dramatic. I remember watching TV between classes, never
                    mind whether you were at Choate or wherever you were watching that on TV was
                    pretty dramatic and still sticks in my mind as it did with other people.
                    Vietnam: we knew there was a war going on there, and it was starting to
                    escalate. We'd read New York Times articles and talk about it. The debate, of
                    course, in the U.S. was starting to heat up, although not to anything like the
                    temperature it was going to have in the future.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Civil Rights movement was getting started particularly
                        with the early arrival of Lyndon Johnson. Did that...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: That was also very much a part of the mix in terms of our education there.
                    I remember some Yale students Yale who had worked in the South one summer came
                    up and talked to us. They'd had some close calls but certainly not only Blacks
                    but also the people who had gone down there to support the movement from places
                    like Yale had been killed. It was hard to believe that was happening in America.
                    We had only one black student and everyone knew there was plenty of
                    discrimination in the north, but killing people for trying to vote. That seemed
                    like something from another country. Choate arranged for a group of us to go to
                    Wesleyan College to hear Dr. Martin Luther King speak. That was an experience
                    not to be forgotten. He was amazing. The power of his ideas and his voice filled
                    the room.</p>

                <p>KLOTH: Kids tend to look at schools in their region. My sister went to high
                    school in New Hampshire and went to University of New Hampshire. At a school
                    like Choate, you look at the standard Ivy League or East coast schools. I went
                    to Dartmouth Collegfor some reason three or four of us from Choate went to
                    Dartmouth that year, Ivy League but a bit off the beaten track for Choate. I
                    guess because most of my classmates felt three of four years of life at Choate
                    had been their years in the wilderness, and they wanted the bright lights of a
                    more urban school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What brought you to Dartmouth.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: I spent the summers in New Hampshire. My first job was a hotel bell hop on
                    Little Lake Sunapee. It's a beautiful state. My guidance counselor at Choate too
                    at one point said to me, - I was looking at Harvard and Dartmouth and Colombia,
                    “I can say different things about each of the schools, but the bottom line is
                    that in college you have a chance to live wherever you like. You probably won't
                    have that chance later in life.”</p>
                <p>I assumed I'd be living in a city like New York or Boston the rest of my life,
                    and Hanover is a beautiful place, so I decided to apply early decision and got
                    in. Great to know in December where you're going. I enjoyed and probably learned
                    more my senior year than my classmates who had to sweat it out until April.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, let's talk about Dartmouth. What was it like
                        when you got there? What kind of a school was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Well, I was there from '64-'68. Dartmouth was unisex, like so many other
                    schools. Dartmouth was in a sense sort of like Choate; it was bigger; the work
                    was a notch harder, I think. We had some minorities, but not that many. Very few
                    Black students, some Asian-American guys. In fact, when I was there it was a big
                    deal that one of the fraternities pledged a Black student because it was said to
                    be one whose national organization was very Southern oriented.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a bias or a thrust of the school toward maybe
                        one party, what was it liberal or conservative, or how would you put
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: I would guess it was on the conservative side, say compared to
                    Columbia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Columbia was going through the...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Well, by '68, there was a change in the college community at large.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At Dartmouth how did you find the social life there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: By junior year I wondered, “What was I thinking coming to an all male
                    school up in New Hampshire.”</p>
                <p>I think Dartmouth going coed was very good in terms of giving it a more holistic
                    experience; the society was changing, but at the time I came to feel we were
                    behind the curve because the school was so isolated up in the woods. In
                    retrospect, I'm glad I went there, but I and others couldn't help but feel out
                    of it. The issue wasn't just co-education but America seemed to be changing and
                    Hanover seemed rather far from those changes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about courses there? Did any stick out in your
                        mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: By that time I was really interested in Asian history. We only had three
                    East Asian history courses, pre-modern, modern and the seminar, so I took all of
                    those and Chinese philosophy as well as Middle Eastern history and Latin
                    American history. I remember a U.S. economic history course that I've found
                    useful over the years in helping me look at economic issues.</p>
                <p>I hesitated to take Chinese because people said it took too much time from other
                    courses to learn the ideographs. I intended to go to Hong Kong or Taiwan to work
                    and study after graduation. (You couldn't go to mainland China then.) I wasn't a
                    great student by any means. I was ready to really study only by my senior year,
                    I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Foreign Service cross your radar at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Yep, and, in fact, my senior year I took the test and just missed passing
                    so that was off the scope. But to finish off my college experience, when I came
                    back from living and working in Mexico the summer of '67, there were riots in
                    American cities and cities burning and there you are with a Mexican family
                    looking at the TV news. They'd ask me what was going on. All I could say was
                    what the Newsweek was telling me, but I felt that I was really disconnected from
                    my own country.</p>
                <p>When I got back to college a friend of mine and I were having lunch one day, we
                    both just jokingly said, “You know the winter is so grim here, and we are
                    missing a lot that's happening, we ought to find a way to go live in the city
                    for a while.”</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>We wanted to do more than just spend a semester at a city school. There weren't
                    internships then, so we were kind of groping. I was talking to another friend
                    and said, “You know I have this idea, but I don't know what to do with it.”</p>
                <p>He had an answer, “Listen, my father is a minister out in LA, and his parish has
                    some kind of relationship with an urban church, let me give him a call.” The
                    next day he came over and said, “Ted, call my father.”</p>
                <p>So I did, and he was really positive, “I just got off the phone with the minister
                    I know. In the summers they have had seminarians at their little church, so they
                    have some Head Start and other education programs you could work at and they
                    have a place to put you up with the caretaker and her family. Would you be
                    interested in coming out and working there?”</p>
                <p>After we'd had a kind of telephone interview with the pastor, he invited us to
                    come out for the winter trimester from January to March. So the punch line was
                    we went in to the Dean. My friend had enough advanced credits when he entered
                    Dartmouth, so he could graduate on time. I was short one course, so the Dean
                    sent me over to the education Department, where I found the department head
                    enthusiastic. He gave us required reading, and we wrote a paper for him and got
                    full credit, so we both graduated with our class.</p>
                <p>It turned out that our Dartmouth-South LA Project was the first internship of its
                    kind at Dartmouth. Now students do such internships routinely but in 1968, there
                    were foreign study but no “intern” programs. There was some talking going on
                    among some of the faculty, but I give Dartmouth credit for letting us by the
                    groundbreakers. I give our parents credit too. They gave us full support.</p>
                <p>Off we went to LA, driving across the country. The area was Compton, bordering
                    Watts. Compton had grown during World War II as a working class town, so from
                    the freeway, it looked like a suburb with all these single-family houses. When
                    you left the freeway, you knew, “Whoa, there is something else going on here,
                    and some of it ain't good.”</p>
                <p>Parts of Compton were still working class Black, Hispanic and White. Then the
                    area of the panhandle, between Watts and somewhere else was pretty tough. Many
                    people in the area had low-income jobs but there was serious poverty, and some
                    nasty types moving through too. Our host cautioned us to keep our eyes open. We
                    had an incidenI got mugged early on because I was careless for a moment but
                    fortunately missed getting seriously hurt by a hair. We decided not to leave.
                    Our mentor was great. “I'm sure you'll never let your guard down again. The up
                    side is people will know you stayed anyway, and will appreciate that.”</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>The people and kids we worked with were great. There was a lot of tension at the
                    high school. That school twenty or thirty years before I think had been
                    predominantly White, and now was Black and Hispanic. Many of the faculty and
                    administration were White, and had started in the system when it was quite a
                    different system. You know this is the Black Power time in '68, and there were a
                    lot of things happening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Things are extremely confrontational with Black Power and
                        that sort of thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Right, and our coming into the school...we didn't go into the high school
                    right away because our mentor wanted to know us better and to let the community
                    get to know us, so we stated working with Head Start. We worked with kids who
                    had severe learning disabilities, little kids, nursery and kindergarten kids in
                    the early afternoons. Then we tutored elementary and junior high school students
                    from 3:30 or so to around 5pm. After a month and a half, we started going to the
                    high school, in the afternoons.</p>
                <p>I realized when I got back to Dartmouth, I was ready to start studying in
                    college; actually my last semester was my best academically.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are talking about confrontational. Did you sort of
                        develop skills in not letting this turn into White guy versus Black guy type
                        of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: We would wear coats and ties like the teachers did. I didn't have any
                    confrontations directly, but as we talked to teachers about what was going on in
                    the school, the stress lines were clear. It wasn't just problems between the
                    faculty and the students or the predominantly White faculty and heavily Black
                    student body, but within the groups. You had the people who were actively
                    dealing drugs, and you had the people who were there to learn. This tension was
                    real. You could see it was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for in the school almost a write off
                        of a certain portion of the school student body and all, this sort of they
                        are not going to make it and let's concentrate over here or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>KLOTH: Well, clearly among the teachers there were different reactions, and it
                    wasn't just an age thing. I had a great deal of respect for all the teachers and
                    administrators of whatever race. A guard with a pistol was at the door as was a
                    metal detector, Some students still got knives and guns and drugs in. Teachers
                    were trying to work with their students. Only a few seemed to have given up. One
                    of the best teachers was White and had worked in NY State prisons with all kinds
                    of characters. He was terrific in figuring out what approach to take with each
                    student as an individual. Another great teacher was Black. He had a terrific
                    combination of no-nonsense but understanding teaching skills. Teachers felt that
                    the principal hadn't figured out how to deal with the changes going on all
                    around him. When I see the challenges in our area's schools today, I feel
                    empathy for all involved. We really short change education.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Vietnam War play at Dartmouth?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Dartmouth was pretty isolated. We only really had a few, small
                    demonstrations in '67-'68 that I recall. There was a lot of discussion, but
                    again people there felt it was a very conservative place. Also, it was
                    predominantly undergraduates, and only about 2,400 hundred of us. Certainly
                    everybody was well aware of the draft. There were certainly students even from
                    when I first got there who were going to graduate school not because they wanted
                    to go to graduate school or Peace Corps but because they didn't want to go to
                    Vietnam. Senator Eugene McCarthy's campaign mobilized some liberal students, but
                    I was in LA then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Actually, when I graduated in 1950 and the Korean War
                        started, so I just figured I might as well enlist.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Right. I had friends who were ROTC. There was a contingent at Dartmouth,
                    but by '68 for graduation the activism level had increased to a level where the
                    ROTC leaders were very worried. Some activists were talking about breaking up
                    the commissioning ceremony. The New Hampshire State Police came in with police
                    dogs. I had a friend who was an ROTC, and he said, “I hope they try.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh boy.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>KLOTH: So that stuff was there, but it wasn't like Columbia where the school was
                    shut down. Our biggest flash was when Alabama Governor George Wallace came to
                    school. That was probably winter, no it couldn't have been winter of '68 because
                    I wasn't there; maybe it was spring of '68..., he was invited to speak.
                    Discussion got hot before he came between those who said he had a right to speak
                    and those who said there should be a protest to break up his speech. I thought
                    students should go but not applaud. Wallace was clever and made some cracks
                    about Harvard, and got predictable laughter which I thought was bad form from
                    the student audience which was stonily silent for much of the rest of his
                    remarks. Some students tried to rush the stage but were blocked by security, so
                    Wallace got the TV news coverage of Ivy League “radicals” “attacking” him.</p>
                <p>KLOTH: I would like to flip back to my high school as well as college experience
                    and hit on a couple of things to finish off.</p>
                <p>One was the importance of writing. I think at Choate and Dartmouth they really
                    did a terrific job. In terms of my Foreign Service work, the best preparation
                    was my junior year at Choate. Our English teacher had us write four two-page
                    typewritten essays a week; maybe it was three. You could write on anything you
                    wanted. You could even write poetry; I think if poetry you only needed a page.
                    Having to write under the gun like that served me well when I got to the Foreign
                    Service where you have to produce a cable or memo quickly.</p>
                <p>Another was a U.S. history teacher who was very critical, this was in 1964, and
                    he was no means a longhaired radical. He was the football coach and had very
                    short hair. But he was very much an iconoclast, and a
                    let's-take-another-look-at-history teacher. So that was, I thought, very
                    liberating and had a staying effect.</p>
                <p>I also credit Dartmouth too with trying to wrestle with the changes going on in
                    the country. There was certainly over the course of my time there, a strong
                    sense that the demographic makeup of the student body didn't reflect the country
                    and that the college needed to reach out more.</p>
                <p>KLOTH: As graduation approached, I looked around for a way to go to East Asia
                    with something that I felt had some socially useful component to it. I was 4-F,
                    so had a broader range of choices than others facing the draft. In 1968, there
                    was no question of going to mainland China. I looked for but didn't find
                    anything in Taiwan or Hong Kong. So a friend of mine also interested in China,
                    found that Peace Corps was in Korea and Malaysia, and we both applied for Peace
                    Corps there. I was offered Peace Corps in Korea. Training started in October. So
                    during the summer I stayed in Hanover, N.H., working in the hospital as a
                    janitor including cleaning out the operating room. I lived in a cabin with a
                    buddy of mine in the woods. We had running water from a spring and 25 yards out
                    back was the outhouse. Then I worked briefly for a congressional campaign.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>I missed the McCarthy political campaign, because I was in LA, so I volunteered
                    for this campaign. It was fascinating. The candidate was a Dartmouth College
                    professor. I didn't know him before I started. I had no experience, so they gave
                    me the most rural districts, the ones they didn't think counted, to go out and
                    scout as an advance man.</p>
                <p>One of the most touching experiences there was in one small town that was
                    literally a general store; that was it. They had a small town hall, just two
                    small rooms and a central lobby with a rotunda, say 20 feet high. All around the
                    rotunda were the names of the men from that district who had gone to the Civil
                    War. There were more men's names on that rotunda than there were people in the
                    district in 1968.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Those places really emptied out. I know my wife is kind of
                        from a small village in the northeast kingdom of Vermont called Sheffield.
                        We'd drive around there, and you'd see signs that would say here stood such
                        and such a town or village, but their foundations were all overgrown.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Well, if you walk through the woods, you come across stonewalls with
                    trees, not bushes, trees, growing in what we called cellar holes, which were
                    houses. You look at the mill towns and the old textile mills put up in 1830 and
                    1840 along the river to take advantage of waterpower. People often forget that
                    our society and economy have always been changing. After the Civil War many of
                    those mill jobs were exported to the U.S. South. Farmers went west because those
                    New England farms were tough to work.</p>

                    voting patterns in a town. I usually talked to whoever was the local Democrat.
                    This was New Hampshire, and I think up through the '90s, it was solidly
                    Republican.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Manchester Union Leader, very conservative. William Lobe I think was the
                    publisher and owner. It was a very, very conservative area. The classic Yankee's
                    up in the hills and even in the small towns. Fiscally very conservative. There
                    were areas that were quite poor; they depended heavily on the tourist business
                    in the summer. I worked in one of these hotels as a bellhop and a dishwasher,
                    then as a salad and sandwich guy, so I had a chance to know some of the folks
                    better than I would have otherwise; certainly better than at Dartmouth where
                    there wasn't that much contact. But I left in early October 1968. Our candidate

                <p>One of the lessons I learned there I think was useful over the years dealing with
                    the press as a Foreign Service officer. Our press guy said to the candidate just
                    before a media conference, “Two minute answers, no longer. If they want to more,
                    they'll ask.”</p>

                <p>KLOTH: Well, it was very frustrating. I'm a lifelong Democrat, and I felt that
                    the country was shifting in ways that weren't good. Having spent time in
                    Compton, I saw the problems of the inner-cities, the drugs and the violence and
                    how they were not understood by most Americans. President Johnson and the
                    Democratic Party had, I thought, been sucked in the mire of Vietnam that led to
                    Johnson's presidency coming to grief and led to the election of Richard
                    Nixon.</p>
                <p>That said, I guess, I suppose too that I put myself first and joined Peace Corps

                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: President Kennedy, of course, had started Peace Corps in the early '60s.
                    We were told that the Korean government had asked for Peace Corps to come in as
                    one of the initial programs. But the U.S. government refused because Korea's
                    leader, former General Park Chung, came in via a coup d'etat, so the U.S.
                    refused to send Peace Corps in then as part of the pressure on the coup makers
                    to “democratize.” By '66, Park's government had held elections, which he won to
                    no one's surprise. The U.S. also wanted Korean troops in Vietnam, so the Johnson
                    Administration sent Peace Corps to Korea. I've never reviewed the diplomatic
                    record, so I'm not sure of the timing of decisions. The U.S. Administration did
                    a lot more for Korea to reward it for sending its troops than just send a few
                    recent college grades to Peace Corps/Korea.</p>

                <p>KLOTH: Well, in terms of development on the economic side, Korea was when I got
                    there in '69 still a poor country. It had a long tradition of literacy, and
                    there was a very strong drive in almost every family to educate their kids. The
                    Japanese colonial government had started schools and a school system that the
                    Koreans then built on with some assistance from us, but I think Korean get the
                    primary credit. Korean families didn't rely just on schools because they had an
                    entrance examination system for university in particular, for companies, for
                    government. Kids would also go to cram schools, if their parents could afford
                    it. That was a big “if,” but as the country moved up on the economic scales more
                    and more families' could.</p>
                <p>Peace Corps was primarily an education program. Volunteers first were put in
                    middle schools and high schools as English teachers. There was one group of
                    science teachers, and one did rural health. By the time our group started
                    training in '68, Peace Corps Korea decided to focus on teaching the teachers by
                    putting us in university English and English education programs. We were in the
                    seventh and eighth groups.</p>
                <p>Earlier programs had problems. Middle and high school classes were so large that
                    the spoken English program had minimal impact. We teach Foreign Service officers
                    Korean for two years to get them to minimal professional competence, so you can
                    guess what a struggle it was for the health volunteers after three months Korean
                    which is what Peace Corps training was.</p>
                <p>Most of the English teachers, in fact, did not speak English well. Many senior
                    professors when I got there had been trained and gotten their degrees under the
                    Japanese. They could often read quite sophisticated literature and could do
                    things such as parse sentences in ways that I had forgotten, but they often
                    couldn't speak with a great deal of fluency. No practice. After the false
                    starts, Peace Corps decided to teach the teachers</p>
                <p>Our two groups started in October in Hawaii. My grouK7 because each group had a
                    number beginning with the first being K1. Our job was to teach in the English
                    departments, and the K8, many of them had teaching experience or MAs, were to
                    teach in education departments at the universities. We spent three and a half
                    months, two and a half months on the big island, in what had been a World War II
                    era military hospital with simple wooden walls, but in Hawaii, that was fine. We
                    were taught Korean; we were taught English teaching methods, and we had Korean
                    culture and history classes. We spent the last month on Oahu practice teaching
                    and getting ready to go.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>Korea Peace Corps had the highest extension rate, that is at the end of two years
                    people wanted to stay another year, and the highest early out rate, meaning
                    someone wanted to leave short of the normal two years, of any country in the
                    Peace Corps at the time. There was therefore a lot of concern among the Peace
                    Corps staff about trying to figure out who would stay two years and who
                    wouldn't. The goal was to drop the trainees who weren't “likely” to stay. There
                    were two reviews; a mid level review and a final review. They didn't exactly
                    fire people, but if they thought they didn't want to send someone, they
                    “counseled” until they decided to drop out and perhaps ask to go to another
                    country. Except one guy who said, “What do you mean I shouldn't go? I'm in the
                    top Korean class, and every other. Did any of the Korean teachers say I
                    shouldn't go?” They backed down. He went.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever figure out why...I can understand a retention
                        rate because you are moving into a society that really loves education.
                        Education is extremely important, so teachers get respect, but why the early
                        out? What was the problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Within the training I think we started with 130 plus and 80 plus went. In
                    the first week or two there were a lot who said, “I don't want to do this.”
                    Korea was a tough military dictatorship; it's physically tough; it's very cold
                    in the winter, and we were in unheated classroom. There's a hard driving quality
                    to Koreans which is why they've gotten where they have in terms of the success
                    story in economic and now political development. All those factors, I think,
                    combined to make it a place where if you decided, you don't really like it, it
                    was a little hard to sort of isolate yourself with your books or travel around
                    in-country or something and make do. Remember too this was 1968.</p>
                <p>The North Koreans had taken the USS Pueblo. In fact, in December, when we were in
                    training, the Pueblo captives, the sailors aboard the ship and the Marines, were
                    released while we were there. The North Koreans had been and were still running
                    armed infiltrators some of whom had been up in the mountains and had gotten
                    shoot outs. People, including civilians were killed. So the Koreans had 50,000
                    troops in Vietnam and supported their troops as it were. So for an anti-Vietnam
                    War American or even someone just coming from the atmosphere of a U.S. campus,
                    even if they had no strong political views, this was a tough place.</p>
                <p>You had to agree you were going to cut off your beard or moustache, and trim your
                    hair because it was a very conservative society, and the schools were a very
                    conservative part of that. Friends who had been in Peace Corps in some other
                    parts of the world told me that they worked hard, often under rough conditions,
                    except for Korea's cold, perhaps rougher than we did, but that the host country
                    atmosphere was much more laid back. But maybe that's ways some of those
                    countries are still in pretty paid shape, while Korea is a world leader in
                    electronics. Then too, being trained in Hawaii in fall and then arriving in
                    Seoul in January was more than a cultural shock.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>For some volunteers, and probably most of us felt this way at some point,
                    teaching English at a university in a major city wearing a coat and tie was not
                    exactly a cutting edge Peace Corp-type job. Peace Corps' image was say working
                    in a farming village.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, well you went out in January of '68?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: '69, we started in October of '68 and January of '69 we arrived. It was
                    very cold; school started in March, so we spent two weeks in a Korean inn. They
                    called them a yogwan; it was a hotel, but the bathroom was down the hall sort of
                    thing. Then we were put in families. No modern apartments to speak of in Seoul
                    then. I had a very nice family, and they worked hard to make me feel at home.
                    The president of our university had gotten her MA from USC (University of
                    Southern California), and she had had one or more exchange students from the
                    U.S. prior to our comintwo of us were assigned to the same university. The prior
                    Americans hadn't apparently adapted well, so she was very solicitous.</p>
                <p>I found among the professors there was a big cut. There were younger ones just
                    starting to come back with U.S. PhDs. They spoke English well and were up on the
                    latest. But many senior faculty, as I said earlier, had had much of their
                    education under the Japanese and hadn't been able to go abroad. You can imagine
                    what that means for a professor of English. You could feel the stress between
                    the professors. For example, the head of my department was one of the older
                    generation. He was very stand-offish when I first met him. Then one day in the
                    faculty lounge, when I say lounge it was a room with a big pot bellied stove in
                    the center of it, I'd just come from my Korean class, so he asked me what I was
                    doing, and I told him in Korean. Suddenly he opened up, and from then on I
                    always made a point of speaking to him in Korean. He was now my “teacher.” We
                    got along well because there was no danger other faculty or students would hear
                    his awkward spoken English. It was a valuable lesson for my future work in the
                    Foreign Service. Help the other guy do his job, and odds are good he'll help you
                    do yours.</p>

                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>KLOTH: I was at Chung-Ang University in Seoul for two years. I extended for a
                    third year and spent it at the Supreme Court's Training Institute. Seoul at that
                    time was a much different city than the great metropolis it is now. Korea was
                    very poor; it was beginning its take off. I think it was just starting to lift
                    off. It was not at altitude by any means. The Koreans were exporting a lot of
                    cloth; they were doing screwdriver plant sort of activities. But they had a very
                    planned development track, which was highly successful and modeled on the
                    Japanese success. There were a lot of Korean laborers in places like Saudi
                    Arabia and Iraq and Vietnam, working for Korean firms who gave them some
                    spending money and deposited most of their pay in banks at home. Now the Korean
                    firms abroad hire Filipinos or workers from similar countries to do the blue
                    collar jobs in foreign countries but in 1969 Koreans did that tough work. When I
                    started in '69, it was the cloth that was being exported rather than clothing.
                    If you wanted something made like a shirt, you went down to the Korean market
                    and ordered one, and they made it for you.</p>

                <p>KLOTH: At first I was depressed, because most spoke poor English even at the
                    university level. After a semester though, I realized it was amazing was that
                    some of them could speak English very well, given the obstacles, large classes,
                    teachers not fluent, and high school classes focused on preparing them for
                    university written exams, and spoken English was not part of that, it was
                    impressive that any spoke English at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the class situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: I had 20-40 students with two sessions a week for each student. When I
                    first went to the university, the Peace Corps Seoul representative, who had gone
                    out and scouted all of these places, wasn't sure I would get the support from
                    the school I needed in terms of size of classes or frequency of classes. When I
                    got there, however, I found that not only did they live up to the agreement, but
                    if I came up with things, they were enthusiastic. I found I could get an
                    English-language movie at the U.S. Embassy's cultural center. When I asked if
                    the university had a projector and could give me a room to show it, the
                    administration immediately did so. We started showing one a month! I would
                    discuss it later with my class; but it was open to everybody in the school.
                    These were not top run Hollywood movies, but things like Winston Churchill or
                    Franklin Roosevelt's life — these kinds of things. But the university was always
                    very serious about supporting me.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>I worked in a Korean organization. I think you come out of the Peace Corps with a
                    different experience than if you work for an American business abroad, let alone
                    the U.S. government. You are working in a Korean organization, and you have to
                    figure out how that organization works. I'm not sure I figured it out but that's
                    what you have to try and do. You are not in a position where you are telling
                    people what to do or these are what the USG wants or else, or these are the
                    rules of our American company.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My experience in the outside is that the Korean
                        organizations are very much driven by those above. The people below really
                        are expected to produce, and if they don't, you just feel the tension and
                        the sweat popping out, because they are given a task and they are supposed
                        to do it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Right. The university president very much ran the place. What was unique
                    about Chung Ang was that the head of the university had created it herself, and
                    she was a woman. In 1968 Korea and even today there aren't many woman university
                    presidents in Korea. This was a coed university, there is a university that's a
                    woman's university and yes there is...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like Ewha.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Yes, but this was a coed school, and she was quite a character. She would
                    be out there when the students were demonstrating, and she would go out there
                    and tell them to get back into class. They would but the next day they'd
                    demonstrate again, and sooner or later run out the gates and clash with the
                    police. You are talking about the top down and do what they say, but it's also
                    the people at the top, at least the better ones, really feel that they have a
                    responsibility that goes down the line as well. It was fascinating and with that
                    I decided to stay a third year.</p>
                <p>I visited the East Coast before I finally decided to stay. I had some money left
                    over because I lived very modestly, and the school paid for my housing and
                    things were cheap. So a Korean friend who was my colleague and I went out to the
                    East Coast and its beautiful mountains. We met a Peace Corps friend out there
                    who was living in the scholar's house of an old yangban, the old Korean
                    nobility. It was just idyllic, cold, but idyllimountains and ocean. And the air
                    was so clean. Seoul was pretty gritty with charcoal used for house-hold heating,
                    and trucks, buses, and cars belching fumes.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>Peace Corps and Fulbright had a legal training program run by two lawyers for
                    judges and prosecutors and the students at the Korean Judicial Training
                    Institute. AID and the Korean government together sent ten to twenty Korean
                    judges and prosecutors, there were almost no private lawyers at that time, to
                    Berkley Law School for a year. Peace Corps provided English teachers for three
                    year long and summer intensive programs. When the PC director heard I wanted to
                    stay another year, he pulled me in. “We need to keep this program going and your
                    colleagues (two lawyers) have been working it. They're leaving. There's a lawyer
                    that AID has brought in to do the legal classes, but I need an experienced
                    English teacher. I would like you to pick up the English teaching side of this
                    and work with the lawyer.” So I let him sort of hornswaggle me into doing that
                    and didn't go out to the East Coast.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of impression were you getting of the political
                        situation there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Two years at university and then a third with legal professionals gave me
                    a view into two different parts of Korean life. In the university the students
                    would demonstrate in the fall and the spring; Korean University, Yonsei
                    University and Seoul National University were the ones who would demonstrate
                    first.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were the top schools?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: These were the top schools, and then it would sort of go down the academic
                    ladder, and the others would then start demonstrating. This activism, of course,
                    came out of the April revolution that overthrew President Syngman Rhee. Large
                    student demonstrations in front of the presidential mansion and then the police
                    either lost their nerve or got overly aggressive or both, and shot into the
                    crowd and killed some students, and then it all came apart in terms of support
                    for the government. That started a tradition for politically active studentrush
                    out and confront the police.</p>
                <p>When I was there in the early '70s, the students would demonstrate. The issues
                    would vary, but they usually with anti the Park government; these were not
                    anti-Vietnam War demonstrations. In one of my first English club meetings with
                    my students I was verbally assaulted as to why the U.S. government was
                    supporting the Korean dictatorship in Korea and then lit into because American
                    students were not supporting our soldiers in Vietnam fighting Communists. In
                    many, many subsequent conversations, I realized both of these tracks were alive
                    and well in the minds of many South Koreans of all ages.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>One of the best points made in our training was that Korea has a love-hate
                    relationship with the United States. You will never be treated better than you
                    will be by Koreans. If you are in a bar and start talking with people, your
                    money will no longer be any good. Strangers will want to treat you. On the other
                    hand, certainly there is plenty of resentment. Because you speak Korean, you'll
                    understand some of the nasty comments about “American SOBs” from some guys at
                    another table. Of course, the same guy bad mouthing you will flee with
                    embarrassment when someone tells him you understand. Or worse yet, he'll want to
                    buy you a drink to make friends! The basic issue is Koreans want to control
                    their national fate. They're grateful for the alliance but resent Washington
                    making decisions too often with “notification” rather than consultatiowe decide
                    and then tell them, hopefully before we tell the media.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the menace to the North? What were you picking
                        up from your students?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Well, I think at that time the students like many Koreans were
                    anti-Communist, but felt one, that the divided-country situation had been
                    created by the United States, first with the agreement with the Soviets in WW II
                    as to who would occupy where. Then, in many Koreans opinion, we didn't carry
                    through and do whatever we had to reunite Korea after the North Korean attack.
                    On more than one occasion students and plenty of other Koreans asked, “Why
                    didn't you let Macarthur finish the job?”</p>
                <p>If you brag a lot about powerful a country you are, as we tend to do, you
                    shouldn't be surprised if, when you get a stalemate like the Korean War, people
                    who feel they're suffering from the outcome believe you left them in the lurch.
                    Of course, there were other factors contributing to the resentment. Koreans
                    rightly felt the Japanese trampled on Korean culture. We Peace Corps volunteers
                    were part of a wave of change as Korea sought to develop as rapidly as possible
                    and still keep their “Koreanness.” You'll recall there was a “culture war” going
                    on in the U.S. too then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel under constraints either from the Peace Corps
                        authorities or the Korean authorities or just by inference about how to
                        treat descent within the Korean student body?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: We were told before we went to understand the U.S. government was sending
                    us to Korea and that with Korean troops in Vietnam, it was inappropriate for us
                    to engage in demonstrations against U.S. policy in Vietnam or to be a heated
                    advocate against U.S. policy in Vietnam. As I recall, we were also told we could
                    take a teacher's approach on any U.S. policy. You could say that this is the
                    U.S. government policy and here are the anti-war groups, criticisms. We were
                    also told correctly that we could expect the Korean authorities would keep a
                    close watch on us and that, if the government felt we had crossed the line on
                    anything from anti-Park statements to wild behavior, the Koreans could tell us
                    to leave and Peace Corps would have to comply.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was very difficult during that period there were
                        protests on the part of the Peace Corps volunteers. How about the Kent State
                        business when, this is in the spring of 1970 when the National Guard
                        actually fired on students at Kent State University and killed some.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Right, there again the usual line from older Koreans and particularly
                    older professors was “that's what happened in 1960 in Korea and that's why the
                    riot police don't have guns. But that's also why we aren't going to let
                    demonstrations get out of hand.”</p>
                <p>The Korean governments response to the demonstrations was to...because they had
                    intelligence agents among the students or students who would tell them and also
                    you just knew it by the calendar. As you got near April 19 and school started in
                    the middle of March, so by April 19 they would bring up the riot police in Chevy
                    flatbed trucks, these aren't trailer trucks but trucks with a flatbed. They
                    would have a fence wire screen over the top of it and the riot police had on
                    helmets made of helmet liners and attached to them were...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like a bib?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Yeah, a kind of bib filled with sand on the back to protect the nape of
                    your neck. Then they had a wire screen that would be pulled down over the front.
                    Then they had shields and Billy clubs and shotguns with teargas attachments on
                    them. They also had at that time what they called pepper fog sprayers; they were
                    also used in the spring and summer against mosquitoes. They just carried them or
                    the truck itself; later on they progressed to more armored trucks or things with
                    mortars that would fire teargas shells. They weren't lethal unless you got hit
                    by the shell it wasn't lethal. But basically they would come in and the students
                    would meet either in front of the soccer field or the campus square; they would
                    meet there and they would rally and talk and chant and sing. Then at some point
                    they'd try to go out the gate and the cops would, at different schools and at
                    different places, the cops would block it with a Roman legion shield wall and
                    they'd fire teargas. Then they would at some point; usually they would let them
                    block the traffic for a while too to annoy the rest of the citizens who are
                    sitting in traffic. I think it still works this way but certainly it worked this
                    way up to the mid-'90s when I was in Seoul seeing them. It was all highly
                    choreographed; I mean each side knew what the other will be doing. Then at some
                    point the police would say that they had to get the traffic moving again. The
                    tear gas would go off. The front rank would put their shields sideways, and the
                    back ranks would charge with their batons high, whack some protesters and try to
                    grab the ones who were the ringleaders. That would go on for a week or so and
                    then they would close the universities until things cooled off.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>At my university there were never many students who demonstrated. The students
                    sympathized but weren't willing to go out. Most of them thought that the
                    demonstrations were heavy on symbolism but light on results. Across the country
                    there was a consensus that economic development was number one and that the
                    North Korean threat was real. People didn't like the government beating up
                    students, torturing professors or newspaper people, but also were worried about
                    “chaos” that might slow economic development or give the North Koreans a chance
                    to use violence. Many South Koreans thought students should be studying. That
                    was the consensus that the Park government played on.</p>

                        difference between the North and the South, which at the time was maybe not
                        that profound?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: In the economic terms the North certainly had the mountains and the

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And waterpower.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: The waterpower, the hydroelectric. During the colonial period certainly
                    there was industry built around Seoul, but there was also industrial development
                    in the North. While the North was heavily bombed during the Korean War and much
                    of it was destroyed...well, actually it began with the Russians taking to the
                    Soviet Union some of the machinery, etc., as they did in other places like
                    Germany, but also the destruction of the war. The planned socialist approach
                    plus aid from the Soviet Union enabled the North to rebuild some facilities. In
                    terms of economic growth, scholars who looked at it as well as the U.S.
                    government felt that up through the '60s, the North had made considerable
                    progress. Perhaps it even did better in the 1950s than the South in terms of
                    economics. Change started in the South in the 1960s.</p>

                        want bread or rice for the cities and they take it away from the farmers who
                        make it. The farmers were doing well and this meant that you had good food

                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>KLOTH: In the seventies he started the Saemaeul (New Village) Movement. Park had
                    been a Japanese Army officer; he spoke Japanese very well as did virtually all
                    Koreans educated before 1945. People continued to have high school reunions with
                    their former Japanese classmates. So those kinds of cultural relations, as it
                    were, kept going in a low key way with a love-hate feeling. Go back to the
                    comment about the U.S. With the Japanese hate was very strong but probably
                    strongest among those born after 1945. Older folks would say to me, “Ah, in
                    1968, this hatred of the Japanese is stronger among the young people who
                    actually never suffered than it is among older people who, while we suffered,
                    also had Japanese friends.”</p>
                <p>More importantly in terms of the larger policy Park and his group looked at Japan
                    both before and after World War II, and particularly after, and said to
                    themselves that the Japanese recovered from World War II quickly, and that's
                    what we want to do, so we'll plan the economy around the development of large
                    private companies. They also wanted companies large enough so that Japanese
                    companies couldn't dominate the Korean economy.</p>
                <p>The North played a role here too. Park and most other South Koreans saw economic
                    development from a nationalist point of view, wanting it so people could live
                    better and also for security vis a vis the North. The Northern threat was direct
                    military aggression as well as subversion in the form of support for a Communist
                    revolution. This was 1968, so Communist movements were still alive and well in
                    many places. South Koreans were very worried about Communist infiltration into
                    the industrial workforce as well as into the rural areas.</p>
                <p>Students could not have summer jobs in a factory the way I did in college. First
                    of all blue-collar people needed factory jobs. College kids were supposed to
                    train for white collar work. The government was very suspicious of college
                    students going out to rural areas, because they were afraid they were going to
                    organize/radicalize farmers. So there was a strong feeling that we need to have
                    economic development; we need to have workers get more prosperous, so they won't
                    become Communists. We also need to limit conspicuous consumption by the people
                    running the factories and the companies. More fundamentally, we need to develop
                    by this Japanese model, which is planned development based on the nurturing of
                    private industry, which of course can very quickly become crony capitalism,
                    which is an element of this too. But there is no doubt that the Koreans have
                    been highly successful in using this model and growing a country.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>It also meant that the industrial people were also very worried about a Communist
                    revolution aided and abetted by the North or another invasion. I remember our
                    first embassy briefing when we were newly arrived in Peace Corps. My
                    recollection was that the embassy briefer said that the North Koreans had a
                    350,000 man army with more tanks, armored personnel carriers and guns than South
                    Korea with a 600,000 plus force. They told us that the U.S. Forces Korea (USFK)
                    added the high-tech part - they didn't call it that at the timwith well-equipped
                    units. They felt there was still a little bit of hint of at least from one
                    briefer, and I can't remember the exact words, and you were in the embassy so
                    maybe I misunderstood what was said, but there was still a little hint of the
                    pre-1950 concern that the South might if they had a proportionate number of
                    armor be tempted to go North; so the U.S. was comfortable with this
                    difference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was always there, yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: More men in the South Korean armed forces but the U.S. forces provide the
                    high-tech edge and in the North fewer men but more armor so this keeps the
                    balance of power. In the mid-seventies we discovered that the numbers had
                    changed dramatically in the North, but not in the South.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of the embassy how much contact did you have in
                        the Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Virtually none. One, we were told not to because Peace Corps was just you
                    know...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah. Did you get involved...obviously going to a geisha
                        house was out of your range but did you get involved or have to be concerned
                        about the drinking because there was an awful lot of drinking. The men went
                        out and one would be the designated leader who would stay sort of sober and
                        the others would get really, really drunk.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: I guess the guys you were hanging out with were pretty responsible. With
                    students or the people I knew there wasn't anybody designated to stay sober. But
                    we all took the bus home.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>Having a car was way out of the price range of students or most Koreans then. The
                    country was poor; further, the Korean government discouraged conspicuous
                    consumption. Taxes were prohibitive. If you had a car, it was a company car;
                    there was a driver and the car was black. Korea was making some cars, basically
                    brought over in crates from Japan and assembled in Korea. “Recycling” was big;
                    there were a lot of former Army jeeps “recycled” as private cars. Someone would
                    get a jeep, strip it and put a hard body on it. A lot of Korean buses and trucks
                    looked like they'd started life in the U.S. Army too. The black market was
                    efficient. An American friend couldn't find the right size jeans in the market,
                    so a shop keeper pulled out what my friend could see was a PX shipping list,
                    asked him what size, run a finger down the list and told him to come back in
                    four days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in what '71?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: I left there in late '71; I'd extended, so I spent three years. I went to
                    the University of Washington (Seattle) for graduate school, where I did an MA in
                    Korean Studies and then completed all but my dissertation for a PhD in East
                    Asian history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you at the University of Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: I was there four years and did my general exams. I went to Korea and Japan
                    to do research, then I came back to write, but I was having trouble getting the
                    work together and got in a rut. I saw friends finish and not get jobs, so I
                    thought I needed to start looking around for alternatives. I was offered a job
                    at a company in Japan with both Americans and Japanese running it; they wrote
                    company reports for Japanese companies. It was a kind of a business information
                    company. I also took the Foreign Service test but it took so long. I also
                    applied for a job at DOD.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Department of Defense.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Right, so I accepted the job in Japan, but I had to wait for my visa, and
                    DOD meanwhile was doing the security check. I was sitting there in Seattle
                    waiting for the Japanese visa to come back and the phone rang. It was a Saturday
                    morning and the phone rang from DOD. They offered me the job, but wanted me in a
                    week. Then the postman brought me a letter saying my visa had been refused. I
                    discovered it wasn't an issue with me but a paperwork problem at the other end
                    which would be “taken care of by the end of the month.”</p>
                <p>I didn't doubt it would be fixed, but the project I was working on to feed myself
                    was finishing and two months was too long, so I decided to go east to DOD and
                    negotiated an arrival a few weeks later.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>Now, after I got to DC and had been there a month or two, I realized a federal
                    bureaucratic calling you on Saturday morning was more than a little unusual.
                    I've learned since that DOD seldom misses a trick when it comes to some things.
                    President Carter was going to put on a freeze on hiring sometime the following
                    month, and DOD wanted to make sure they had the new hires on board, so their
                    Personnel office was told to work Saturday!</p>
                <p>KLOTH: Department of Defense. I went there and having been F4 (physically
                    disqualified) and never done military service, it was a fascinating experience.
                    DOD is a huge place and a huge bureaucracy. My job was writing rather longer
                    studies on military capabilities on the Korean Peninsula.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get a feel for the Department of Defense outlook
                        that sort of stood you in good stead in later times? I mean these are
                        different cultures than the Foreign Service. Did you pick up any of that
                        while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: I think so. In addition to my regular duties I also was sent in what was
                    it, spring '81 for about six to eight weeks to the Office of the Secretary of
                    Defense, sort of the mini-State Department at DOD, to augment their Korean
                    affairs staff to prepare for the first Reagan Administration U.S.
                    Secretary/Republic of Korea Minister of Defense meeting. The Carter
                    administration in the late '70s, because of the coup in Korea, had stopped
                    having ministerial/secretarial level meetings between the Defense Department and
                    the Ministry of Defense in South Korea as an expression of U.S. dislike for the
                    coup d'etat of 1980. So the Reagan administration as part of its new policies
                    decided to renew those, so I was sent over temporarily and worked in that
                    office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in DOD from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: I was there from '80 to '82, and then in March of '82 I came to State. I'd
                    kept my application, through the exam process, alive at State because I came to
                    realize that at DOD my opportunities for going overseas were limited. I liked
                    working at OSD, though, so who knows, if I hadn't come to State I might still be
                    happily somewhere at DOD.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you notice was there a perceivable shift at your
                        perspective from when Carter left and Reagan came in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>KLOTH: I was far enough down in the food chain that it didn't affect me directly;
                    however, there certainly was a change that one could feel. Literally, I remember
                    Jimmy Carter to save energy had turned off the hot water in government buildings
                    and turned down both the air conditioning and the heat. A day or two after the
                    inauguration of the new presidenReagan — I was in the bathroom and turned on the
                    hot water without thinking, and hot water came out. Things had changed!</p>
                <p>Obviously at the policy level there was a dramatic shift. In the Korean Peninsula
                    area where I worked the first policy change was very clearly the embrace of
                    President Chon and his coup-makers and, in my area at the time, the resumption
                    of defense meetings at the secretarial and ministerial level with the
                    Koreans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then we'll bypass the analysis bit because that
                        treads on what still may be classified stuff...so what about in '82 what
                        happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Even with experience at the Defense Department, you come into State as a
                    Foreign Service Officer cold. You're headed for a visa line somewhere just like
                    every new entrant. The advantage is, of course, when they hire you they match
                    your salary; you get credit for prior service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall the oral exam, any of the questions now and
                        how they struck you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Right. Well, from what I heard from friends who came in through the oral
                    exam in the early 1970s, there had been a huge change. I took it my senior year
                    in college, just missed and then went on with other things. They had dropped
                    diplomatic history sort of questions, and had a new system where you would have
                    an interview as they used to have and you would do a writing sample, but they
                    had also added on an exercise where they had you work through a hypothetical
                    in-box. In our case they said you are running an international house at a
                    university. We also had a group exercise. The exam was divided now clearly now
                    into political, economic, consular and administrative fields. Having lived
                    abroad in Peace Corps and as a grad student, I had some idea about consular work
                    like getting a passport renewed or a document notarized or emergency evacuation
                    plans.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>Let me note what I discovered was an important change for me. I think in '78,
                    they changed the medical standards and, while I had been in Peace Corps, etc., I
                    have a handicap, which affects my ability to walk, although I can get around on
                    my own and lived and traveled abroad with what seemed to me no trouble. I was
                    told by the examining physician in 1981 that before '78, I would have been
                    excluded on worldwide suitability grounds. I found it ironic. Working and living
                    conditions in the Foreign Service officer with housing provided and working in
                    heated buildings, central heating, etc. were a lot more comfortable than they
                    were when I was in Peace Corps. That includes living in hooch in Baghdad where I
                    had a heater and an air conditioner I never had as a Peace Corps Volunteer. So I
                    think there was that historic change at State, in addition to the emphasis on
                    equal opportunity for others. In our A-100 course, it seems to me that maybe
                    about 40 percent of our class was female, I'm not sure. Also we had quite a
                    variety of ages; I think the oldest person in the class was probably around 50;
                    the average age for our class was about 30.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were how old at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: I was 35 at the time, so I was on the older end of the central group. We
                    had some very young ones and, in fact, one of the youngest guys later went on to
                    be an ambassador and assistant secretary. We had quite a variety of experience;
                    we had people from various occupations, including business. The Department
                    brings in people with a much broader experience base than most of the East Asian
                    foreign services who bring in new officers right out of college.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think so. How did the class strike you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: I was very impressed. They were very sharp. We had a lot of experience in
                    different things, which made lunches and coffee breaks interesting. Also folks
                    had a chance to see other types of work and decided this was what they wanted to
                    do. Coming back to your comment about the military, I remember when we went over
                    to the War College. The president of the War College, an Air Force three star
                    general, talked to us. He was one of the sharpest guys I've ever met in any
                    business. He started by asking how many people had been in the military or had
                    some experience with the military. Because in '75 the draft was over, we had
                    some veterans, both men and women, perhaps 20-30 percent. The general said the
                    single biggest worry he had for the future of not only our diplomatic corps but
                    also government in the foreign policy area. That is that we wouldn't have people
                    who had been, even if it was a two year draftee as a private, in the service and
                    who understood the way DOD works and the way the military looks at problems.
                    Given the struggles we're having in Iraq and Afghanistan getting military and
                    civilians to function together effectively, he was prescient.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know it's true, I came in in '55 and we were
                        practically all male and practically all had served. I had reached the
                        exalted rank of Airman First Class but still almost all of us had military
                        experience. It made it much easier to deal with people in the military
                        because you kind of understood where they were coming from.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Actually flipping back to my DOD experience we did have one incident while
                    I was there, that perhaps illustrates the challenge that the military and
                    intelligence services faces in evaluating information and concern about the
                    deadly serious consequences of being wrong. I guess from our post-Iraq War
                    perspective it may seem tame, but it was my introduction to the security policy
                    world.</p>
                <p>In 1981, some in the intelligence community became concerned that the North
                    Koreans were gearing up for a major military action. The evidence was such that
                    there was also a lot of skepticism, but clearly everybody at DOD and the
                    intelligence community focused in very hard but decided in the end that what was
                    going on was an exercise.</p>
                <p>I was at DOD and was part of one analytical group looking at the question. We all
                    thought the totality of evidence indicated no attack, but also realized the
                    terrible consequences of being wrong. We could feel that weight. We were very
                    much aware of the Yom Kippur War, when the Egyptians had run forces up a number
                    of times in practice to the Suez Canal but stopped when their toes got wet, but
                    the final time they threw the assault troop across. While the Israeli's had
                    stood up to some extent, they hadn't mobilized enough strength to prevent
                    initial success.</p>
                <p>So I think that's something when you talk about the military culture and
                    perspective. DOD is very much focused on a possible opponent's capabilities,
                    which is different from intentions. The first question was always what do they
                    have, followed by what can we do if they use it? DOD is clearly in the business
                    of dealing with capabilities and trying to prepare for that. At State we tend to
                    focus more on intent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Intent usually implies logic. Unfortunately, our logic is
                        not necessarily the logic of somebody else. Saddam Hussein went into Kuwait,
                        and we seem to have thought maybe he would try to grab some peripheral oil
                        fields which was logical to us. Going in and arousing the wrath of everyone
                        and taking over all of Kuwait didn't seem logical, and we made the wrong
                        judgment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: And it's a question too of their logic being based on assumptions they are
                    making and factors that are driving them which we may not be aware of.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>KLOTH: Saddam repeatedly made bad decisions. We also need to remind ourselves in
                    foreign relations, not everyone is impressed with U.S. decision-making. As we
                    are reminded now in our financial crisis, it's not just foreigners and not just
                    dictators who can make some very bad decisions. I don't mean to pick on us, but
                    we are people, and sometimes we forget to be perhaps a bit more humble in
                    holding ourselves up to others as a political or economic or societal model.</p>
                <p>At any rate, so I went through A-100, which was fascinating. We went to other
                    agencies and the Hill. I remember a Foreign Service officer at the NSC starting
                    by saying to us, “I'm not quite sure why I'm still here because I started
                    working at the NSC under Jimmy Carter and here we are in 1982 in the Reagan
                    administration.... I guess because I was a career Foreign Service officer, they
                    left me in place.”</p>
                <p>I heard later from friends both at State and Defense that was not usual for thaor
                    other changes in administrations. Non-career FSO Ambassadors and other political
                    appointees move on pretty fast, especially when the political temperature is
                    high as it was in the Carter to Reagan shift.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, almost from day one you got 24-hours to clear your
                        desk and get out sort of thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Right. I had some three and two level officers who felt the heat because
                    of the desk they were on when the Reagan transition team can into State.
                    Sometimes the new political management in a transition has to learn that FSOs
                    and our civil service colleagues see themselves as career civil servants. Tell
                    us what the policy is, and we will work very hard to make that successful. There
                    was on the part, I guess, of some of the people that came in on the Reagan
                    transition a certain zealousness and a certain lack of understanding of the way
                    the career service works. Secretary Powell, as a career military officer, seemed
                    to understand the role of professionals in the Department better. Usually too,
                    after a new Administration comes in, the new management quickly discovers, and
                    many know before they come in, that the policy options expressed during the heat
                    of a campaign run into the brick wall of reality abroad or at home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way you almost had a feeling that a lot of America,
                        particularly Central America, was turned over to the right wing; this is
                        Jessie Helms and all. And just as long as you don't bother us in the Middle
                        East and other more critical places or something like that. This is sort of
                        the impression I get.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>KLOTH: Right. But back to the story. In the A-100 at the time they were very big
                    on telling everybody you will go overseas for perhaps your first and second
                    tours. State wants to see how you'll function abroad before deciding after 3-4
                    years (at that time, now more like 3-5 years) whether to give you tenure. I
                    discovered later that other foreign affairs services take the opposite tack.
                    They keep you at home in the ministry for your initial tour or tours to size you
                    up and also accustom you to how the ministry works. Another factor, I suppose,
                    is that none of the services have the demand for visa officers we do or use a
                    face-to-face interview so much in that work. We have a great demand for visa
                    officers which we fill through first and second tour officers, as you know.</p>
                <p>At any rate, in A-100, we were told we would be assigned to areas we hadn't been
                    before to see how we'd function in a new place. In my case, China and Korea were
                    there, Taiwan and Guangzhou and Seoul. Since I had spent so much time in Seoul,
                    I went up and asked the director of junior officer personnel if it was worth my
                    while to even put Seoul down because my wife had a Fulbright there.” He said,
                    “If you are interested, bid.”</p>
                <p>I found out later that there was no question from the time I walked in the door
                    where I was going. In February '82, the Seoul consular section uncovered a major
                    immigrant visa fraud operation, when a very sharp officer discovered some
                    anomalies in immigrant visa applications. Investigation uncovered a long-time
                    visa fraud operation, involving employees of the embassy and some visa brokers
                    in the U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that thing started bout '79, I think. The reason I
                        say this is I was consul general. I had just gone to the head of the
                        consular affairs, Barbara Watson, and said I think we have some real
                        problems. She had our security officer replaced and brought a guy in who
                        really went to work there. We uncovered some stuff, and we felt pretty good
                        and all the time this other stuff was coming in. The Koreans are very good
                        at this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: They have been a bureaucratic society a long time and have developed a lot
                    of finessing skills to live with their own labyrinth of rules and paperwork.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know I used to tell the officers there, you know this
                        is awful, we've got to do what we can to stop it but basically fraud or no
                        fraud we are getting very good people in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which we were.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>KLOTH: Yeah. There were some other things that happened to. President Chun
                    Doo-hwan, the coup-maker of 1980, began a program of liberalizing certain
                    aspects of the society. One of them, for example, was making passports for
                    tourism available; you had to go with a group or to see relatives. Until then it
                    had been extremely difficult for Koreans to get a passport. A major reason was
                    that the Korean government wanted to conserve foreign exchange. So, for example,
                    if you wanted to study abroad it had to be a graduate school. You took not only
                    the TOEFL and GREs, but you also had a Korean government exam to pass.</p>
                <p>There were other things, the high school students wore uniforms whose origins
                    goes back to actually 19th century Europe and then were Japanese educational
                    standard during the colonial period. Japanese kids still wear uniforms, although
                    they wear them in a style that is quite different from the old days with
                    loosened ties and various other signs of protesor fashion. The Chun government
                    said schools could set their own dress codes and students no longer had to wear
                    uniforms.</p>
                <p>So the government was easing up on the social constraints by the prior government
                    without letting up at all on the control of politics. It also reflected the
                    development in the economy and that there were people who were not just the
                    “super rich” in a poor country, but middle and upper middle class that did have
                    enough money to go see relatives or take a group tour to Europe. We also had
                    through the '70s a phenomenon of increased immigration from Korea to the United
                    States because of changes to the immigration law in what the '60s, so more
                    Koreans had friends and relatives to visit here.</p>
                <p>For that reason the consular section in Seoul was under the gun, and I had Korean
                    and a lot of experience there, so there wasn't really a question of where they
                    could use me best. As I looked at other people in our class' assignments, many
                    were assigned to where they had been. When new people come in, there's no
                    guarantee that a slot will be open in Korea, even if you speak Korean, so the JO
                    people need to manage expectations, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah. Also, in the business I've been on both sides of
                        this. You have to be careful when people come in, they might have majored in
                        Mongolian studies and they are going to go to Mongolia. Well, there might
                        not be a place or maybe the feeling is particularly sometimes there is more
                        to diplomacy for a professional than Mongolia. You have people who really
                        aren't very moveable but again when the rubber hits the road and if you've
                        got a consular crisis or something, I mean they throw everybody at it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Right. But we also lose people like a good friend who was in Chinese
                    studies, but when they offered him the job he said, this was in that same early
                    '80s, the recruiter read the standard line which is “we probably won't send you
                    where you've been. In fact, we try to send people to different places.”</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>My friend had just got an offer from the CIA to work on China. They said, “China,
                    that's what your background is.” So he decided to do that. Clearly for the
                    Department there is a tension particularly when you look at the hard languages.
                    Now our desperate need for languages like Arabic is swinging the pendulum the
                    other way.</p>
                <p>I went to Seoul my first tour. I was in Seoul and my wife had her Fulbright, so
                    that was very good and we could be together. I have a lot of friends there, so
                    that was interesting. The visa work was hard, though. We interviewed visa or
                    passport applicants from early in the morning to 3:00 or 4:00, when they closed
                    the doors and then you had an hour to clean up paperwork, and 5:00 we were out.
                    The management of the section was very tough minded about that which was good
                    for the officers. We had huge lines around the block and couldn't keep up; there
                    had not been an increase in officers to match the increase in applicants.
                    Nevertheless, the feeling of management was that, looking at the numbers,
                    staying until 6:30 or 7:00 every night was not going to make a significant
                    decrease in that line. Unlike ever State job I had afterwards, evenings were our
                    own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Dixie Walker, who had been a professor from the University of South
                    Carolina, a China scholar and the first political appointee to ambassador to
                    Korea. My first ambassador when I was in Peace Corps had been Habib, Philip
                    Habib. I only met him once; he had dinner at the Peach Corps director's house
                    with about 20 of us. He was a very impressive guy. It was good chance to share
                    impressions of Korea. The volunteers' relationship with the embassy was
                    basically distant. That was fine with everybody, and Peace Corps guidance.
                    Koreans assumed we “reported” to the embassy, so we tried to dispel that notion
                    in words and action. But it was useful to hear how the embassy saw things and to
                    feel we had a chance to share our thoughts.</p>
                <p>I found later as an FSO that no matter how much you get out, as an embassy
                    officer, you need to hear as many sides as you can get. You need to hear from a
                    range of people doing different things. It's too easy to fall into a rut with
                    the “usual contacts.” One incident I remember from Peace Corps stayed with me as
                    a reminder. The one time I remember where we PCVs reached out to our embassy
                    concerned the Chevy trucks USAID had given to the “combat police.” As I recall
                    the embassy's brief, the original idea was that the combat police were specially
                    trained to combat North Korean infiltration of armed agents, a real problem. The
                    trucks provided mobility and were to be used primarily on the coast. But the
                    combat police were used in the cities as riot police. The riot squads stationed
                    in front of universities drove up in the trucks with big USAID logos on them. I
                    remember one student coming up to me and saying, “Why did you give them those
                    trucks to come and beat us?”</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>At one of our regular Peace Corps meetings, we said to the Peace Corps director,
                    “You know, we try to talk about the U.S. government policy of not supporting
                    dictatorships [and avoid criticizing Park, by that time an elected President,
                    directly), but you've got those USAID branded trucks out there.”</p>
                <p>The Director told us that the embassy asked the Korean police not to use the
                    trucks for such duties. The Koreans responded very quickly - they repainted the
                    trucks and replaced the USAID clasped hands with the national police logo!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well let's come back to '82. Who was the consul
                        general?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Ken Keller. He had been a political officer in Europe who found it so
                    frustrating working on Eastern Europe where “nothing seems to change” that he
                    decided to do something “more hands on.” He moved over into the consular
                    business.</p>
                <p>At any rate, he was under the gun in the sense of a sudden jump in the number of
                    applicants because of the Koreans opening the floodgates to tourism and
                    others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We didn't really have walk-ins.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Right, they also eased up on student passports. If you wanted to apply to
                    go to a high school or even an elementary school in the U.S., you could do that.
                    Yes, there were some who were going to good schools and clearly good students,
                    but there were a lot of other folks who, and this is still a feeling among some
                    Koreans, thought, “Well, my kid isn't doing well, not going to be able to pass
                    the exam in Korea to get into a good university here, so I'm going to send him
                    or her to the U.S. to live with a relative or just going to get an apartment
                    myself, and we are going to send him to the local high school, because then
                    they'll be able to get into a university in the States. When they come back to
                    Korea, they'll speak English well or maybe they'll just stay in the States.”</p>
                <p>Plenty of other people wanted to seek their fortunes in the U.S. as well. So we
                    had a flood of people of dubious academic backgrounds, dubious job prospects in
                    Korea, say, working in jobs in Korea in small companies or under-employed who
                    wanted to live in America. The visa brokers could make really authentic looking
                    Korean and even U.S. documents of all kinds.</p>
                <p>The vice consul's job of deciding in 2 minutes whether you were being lied to or
                    just talking to a nervous but legitimate applicant who just wanted to see
                    Disneyland. We had 20 percent refusal rates. We also had long lines around the
                    embassy, and it was hard to meet even old friends without hearing
                    complaints.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved with fraudulent marriages of people
                        getting an Asian wife and that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Well, fraudulent marriage was a problem but hard to catch if people kept
                    their stories together. I recall one case of an American resident in Korea for
                    some time with a perfectly legitimate job where all seemed on the up and up. A
                    few days after I issued the spouse a visa, the Immigration and Naturalization
                    Service representative in Seoul came in and said, “This guy called me up and
                    said that it was fraudulent. His actual girlfriend had some financial issues and
                    borrowed money from somebody she shouldn't have. She and her boyfriend were told
                    they could clear the decks if her boyfriend would engage in a fraudulent
                    marriage.”</p>
                <p>We called Korean immigration and told them to stop the visa-holder. They
                    discovered that the person hadn't left country, so maybe they lost their nerve
                    too. Consular work is tough because you know you'll inevitably deny some
                    legitimate people and issue visas to some who will never return. But the
                    pressure must be immense post-9/11, but illegal immigration, not terrorism, was
                    our chief concern in a place like Korea of the 1980s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You really change their lives.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Yeah, but again Ken Keller, our consul general, was very good in terms of
                    training us and our section chiefs continually kept us informed of the latest
                    usually scams.</p>
                <p>There was also the challenge within the embassy of people in various sections
                    coming down to refer people who it turned out they really didn't know in order
                    to help out an official contact. In general the section chiefs handled all those
                    cases. When I returned in the political section in the early '90s, the shoe was
                    on the other foot. Speeding someone through the visa process was a useful favor
                    to be able to do. On the other hand, if I got involved in anyway and the visa
                    was refused, that didn't help me. Having been a visa officer, I had some idea of
                    the “bad case” warning signs and refused to get near those requests for
                    assistance. We had a sharp NIV chief, and he set up a very useful system where
                    you could ask that a person be given an interview appointment, if you didn't
                    know the case well enough to “refer” it to the consular section with a note that
                    you knew the person well. Getting a call from the visa section to come in for an
                    appointment at such and such a time sure beat waiting for hours in line, so it
                    was appreciated by your contacts. On the other hand, my credibility was not on
                    the line with my consular colleagues or, if refused, with the person who had
                    asked for the help for say a constituent.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>Let me finish by noting that working the consular section gives a new officer
                    from any cone a lot of experience that she or he will use in the Foreign
                    Service. You have to learn to gather the facts and analyze them fast. You have
                    to make decisions quickly and be able to justify them. You also learn to work
                    with interpreters. It's often said that foreign negotiators who speak English
                    have an advantage of American counterparts because the foreigner can use the
                    translation time productively to consider the response and may pick up nuances
                    lost in translation. On the visa line I found it true. Although I speak Korean,
                    in tough cases, I would call an interpreter over to give me more time as well as
                    to be sure I did not miss anything. I could also check on the quality of
                    interpretation. Another often unrecognized skill learned on the line and useful
                    later is how to work with an interpreter, even if you do not speak the language.
                    You have to speak clearly so the interpreter can understand and to be alert as
                    you listen to the English interpretation back to you as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Korea at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Now to leap to the politics. In 1979, when I was still a grad student in
                    Seattle, Park Chung Hee was shot. That set in motion a succession process that
                    turned into a slow motion coup. In the end Major General Chun Doo-hwan, head of
                    the Defense Security Command, was in the key position when the chief of the KCIA
                    shot the president. The head of the KCIA was not part of an extensive coup. I
                    mean there was not a coup group, including military leaders. When the generals
                    realized that this guy didn't have any army divisions behind him and none of
                    them were with him they arrested him But then Chun Doo-hwan and a group who had
                    gone through the military academy with him slowly expanded their control,
                    shoving aside the three civilian Kim's — Kim Jong Pil, Kim Dae Jung and Kim
                    Young Sawho were competing with each other politically and other players out
                    there. The prime minister when Park was shot was not a strong enough individual
                    to deal with this very difficult situation.</p>
                <p>KLOTH: In March 1980 I had started in DOD, so I was in the U.S. government when
                    the Kwangju incident happened. The Kwangju uprising was the result of Korean
                    army units' brutality when they clashed with students protesting Chun's seizure
                    of power. The army then retook the city. The repercussions are still out there
                    both for Koreans' attitudes toward the Chun Doo-hwan group and toward the United
                    States as well. In 1982, the wounds were still fresh and resentment toward the
                    U.S. at higher levels than I had ever seen. Koreans of all political shades
                    believed that we were “actively complicit,” because we had a four-star general
                    in Korea who was the UN commander. How, many asked, could Korean military units
                    have moved and been used in the coup or in Kwangju without his
                    authorization?</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>The change in Korean's feelings toward the United States was palpable. There was
                    an escalation on the negative side of Koreans' attitudes towards the US,
                    reflecting their fundamental dislike of their own government as well. Part of
                    the mix was the Reagan administration's position that the Carter administration
                    had been na�ve about the fundamental struggle between Communists and
                    non-Communists in many countries around the world. As a symbol of the change in
                    the Reagan administration's policy from what it considered the na�ve attitude of
                    the Carter administration, Chun Doo-hwan was the first foreign leader who
                    visited President Reagan.</p>
                <p>The issue illustrates a key foreign policy dilemma. The challenge for the U.S. in
                    dealing with governments such as coup d'etat governments or other dictators is
                    that they have bet their lives. If a coup fails, the odds are good the
                    participants will get death sentences. When we try to exert our influence, we
                    are playing poker with a guy who's bet his life. When the ante starts to go up,
                    we're going to have to fold in most cases because we won't be willing to bet it
                    alwhatever that happens to be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That covers the “big picture” then, but I'd like to pick
                        up the tale of what an FSO does. Did you get involved in the protection of
                        Americans and all that? American services? Were there many problems there or
                        was this mostly notarial or passport type of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Yes, I did three months in that as well. We did a fair number of
                    passports, including lost passports. There were some touching individual cases.
                    The most touching ones involved people in some kind of distress. One little girl
                    visiting relatives fell off a second story balcony of an apartment and was hurt.
                    She broke her anklyou can imagine when her mother described what happened at the
                    start of the call, I feared much worse. Her folks wanted to get her back to the
                    States for medical treatment of her broken ankle and wanted a U.S. military
                    medical evacuation plane. She was not in a life threatening condition. I had to
                    explain that those were for our soldiers and that we would help her parents get
                    in touch with the civilian airlines. At first, though, there was a lot of
                    discussion with her parents. They assumed, as did many other Americans, that the
                    U.S. Air Force would zoom them home. The U.S. airline they had come in on was
                    very solicitous, however. I checked with the family just before departure to
                    make sure everything was on track, and they were much relieved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do after your year and a half back in the
                        consular section?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>KLOTH: Then I went to Japan, to Fukuoka via a six month refresher Japanese in
                    Yokohama to bridge the December 1983 to July 1984 gap before the incumbent in
                    Fukuoka transferred. Japan was very popular as an assignment. There was a boom
                    of interest at U.S. universities too. Japan's economy was booming, and the trade
                    friction with the United States made the trade issue number one. Now I
                    understand that China is all the rage and understandably so. That's where my
                    interest in the Far East started.</p>
                <p>When I was in Tokyo in the late '70s as a graduate student, the Japanese press
                    was full of trade issues and the back and forth about U.S. complaints about
                    Japanese protectionist policies which were accurate. The Japanese, of course,
                    said U.S. companies didn't try hard enough and that had some truth as well. For
                    my second tour then, I thought I'd like to see the situation from outside Tokyo,
                    and got a job at the consulate in Fukuoka as economic-commercial officer. A
                    friend of mine recommended a consulate as fun, and it was. I did a lot of public
                    speaking everywhere from Rotary clubs to Chambers of Commerce. I had two very
                    good Japanese employees; we worked with American businessmen who were in the
                    area and helped them sell everything from women's leotards and Texas beer to
                    nuclear power plant equipment. I was there from summer of '84 to summer of '86.
                    We had a consul, economic/commercial officer plus a consular/admin officer
                    because at that time Japanese needed visas to come to the United States. We also
                    had a USIS cultural center.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Japanese Red Army an issue at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: No, it was pretty well gone. We did computerized name checks for visas.
                    Occasionally we'd have demonstrations in front of the consulate, but they were
                    rather small and not a danger. Japanese police would always bring a police bus
                    around, but I never saw a confrontation.</p>
                <p>The Chinese consulate general was down the street from us. A big black right-wing
                    bus would come by sometimes with its loud speakers blaring. Just after they
                    passed my window you'd hear the guy changing from the anti-US to the
                    anti-Chinese tape.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. How would you describe particularly from your
                        perspective relations with the United States at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Because of the heated negotiations over trade issues at the time, a key
                    mission of the consulate was to get out and tell the U.S. side of the story. We
                    also helped U.S. firms enter or expand in the market. We knew the people in the
                    companies in the region as well as the local economic situation.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>Japanese in our area felt the overall U.S. relationship was important to their
                    country but that Japan was being picked on unfairly on trade. In their view,
                    Japan needed to export to buy raw materials such as oil and minerals it did not
                    have. Japanese companies' success was a result of finding out what foreign
                    markets wanted and making it at a good price. Most Japanese I met felt that the
                    basic problem was U.S. companies weren't any longer internationally competitive
                    vis a vis Japanese companies. Trade complaints, and automobiles were the big
                    centerpiece, were unfair. In their view, U.S. companies had gotten lazy and were
                    not producing high quality goods from TVs to cars.</p>
                <p>While U.S. buyers of Japanese products were clearly saying the same thing, in its
                    post-WW-II drive to grow its economy, the Japanese government had, in large part
                    by design but also because of the way its bureaucratic system worked, closed its
                    market to protect its companies. One major issue in negotiations was the
                    difference between U.S. and Japanese standards. We can go further into this and
                    other trade problems later. In a consulate you do not negotiate but you
                    certainly investigate and provide useful information and perspective to
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>Take the case of autos. I went to the Cadillac dealer in Fukuoka. And I said to
                    him, “You know, I'm reading in the press about all these safety requirements
                    that are being levied on all foreign autos to conform to the Japanese 'safety
                    standards.' Could you show me on the Cadillac what has to be done to pass
                    Japanese inspections?”</p>
                <p>He clicked off the list which meant that Cadillacs, like other foreign cars, had
                    to have a number of modifications done in a GM shop in Japan. That added to
                    costs. For example, cars were required to have turning signal lights visible
                    from the right and left sides as well as from the front and rear, so GM had to
                    put on additional little lights on. That's probably not a bad idea for safety,
                    but the “standard” that really got to him was that the requirement to have a
                    metal plate under the engine. He had been told that was so if you parked on
                    grass the hot engine wouldn't set the grass on fire. Where, he wondered, do
                    people park cars on grass in Japan?</p>
                <p>I used to do a lot of factory tours and saw the strength of the relationships
                    between Japanese firms and their suppliers that was very difficult for a foreign
                    firm to break into. I visited a shipyard in Nagasaki in '85. They said, “Well
                    you know the competitive pressure is coming on from Korean shipyards, so we have
                    to cut our costs which means our suppliers are going to have to cut their costs.
                    But we send engineers around to them; we send bookkeepers around too and see if
                    we can help them to cut back, to rationalize and improve the efficiency of their
                    operations.”</p>
                <p>The yard was reluctant to look for new suppliers even in Japan, let alone abroad
                    in the US. Yard management knew their suppliers and felt they could count on
                    them. From their viewpoint, the start-up costs of a new supplier were high.
                    Nevertheless, shipyards are businesses. When in 1985, the Plaza Agreement
                    greatly strengthened the yen against the dollar, we got a call from them asking
                    for to help finding U.S. suppliers!</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>Rice was a very sensitive issue, you may recall. I went to Saga City to talk to
                    rice farmers. They were pretty excited that the U.S. was demanding that they
                    open their rice market. But it was not personal. They were gracious hosts. In
                    that area, the farmers blamed Japanese government farm policies for making it
                    difficult for them to be competitive internationally. Cheap farm credit and
                    taxes, especially for small farm machines, let “weekend farmers,” people with
                    office jobs, buy equipment and supplies at favorable rates and encouraged them
                    to hold on to small plots and made it very expensive for full-time farmers to
                    increase their farms size, and so, my farmer friends pointed out, become more
                    competitive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that rice thing was very tricky wasn't it? I mean,
                        as agriculturalists in the United States know European agriculture is
                        protected.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: The U.S. also has quotas for agricultural products such as sugar. It is my
                    bottom line is and still is my bottom line: trade friction is an economic
                    problem; it's a political problem. At any rate, our job was also to give
                    hands-on assistance to U.S. firms. We had a number of success stories for
                    companies large, medium and small, on both sides of the Pacific. I worked with
                    Westinghouse in Tokyo and a Japanese power company in Kyushu to restore their
                    frayed relationship on purchase of nuclear-power-plant equipment. I spent about
                    a year and a half and the result of a $10 million deal. As econ-commercial
                    officer, I was not a Westinghouse salesman per se, but lived in Fukuoka and
                    could act as a go-between. Living in Fukuoka I could make drop by and talk to
                    the Japanese firm about how things were going. I could anticipate issues, call
                    Westinghouse and tell them to come down and head off problems. We did the same
                    thing for small U.S. businesses or new-to-market companies too. For example, our
                    work resulted in a U.S. firm finding a Japanese franchisee after years of
                    trying.</p>
                <p>I also enjoyed living in Kyushu, having lived in Tokyo as a grad student.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a period where the Japanese system seemed to be
                        the world model.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Do you remember Ezra Vogel's popular book on Japan as number one? But
                    there was another side; the Japanese companies did not escape the economic
                    challenges businesses anywhere have. The Nippon Steel in Kitakyushu and Oita had
                    had to institute a RIF (reduction in force) in the '70s and '80s. They didn't
                    like to fire people, but tough business conditions forced them to stop hiring,
                    offer buy outs; and “early retirement” workers, often by placing them in
                    suppliers' companies.</p>
                <p>I asked one supplier of industrial-size steel containers how that worked: did he
                    need more help? I had heard some argue that because of “unique Japanese
                    culture,” Japanese large firms and their suppliers “cooperated harmoniously on
                    such issues.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>The small company manager I talked to had perhaps a different perspective. “Yeah,
                    they did the RIF. I had a hundred or so employees. The economic situation was
                    hitting my sales too. The steel company approached me to take three of their
                    people. You've got to understand I buy the steel for my cans from the steel
                    mill. The mill is also my major customer. Now, if they ask me to help them out,
                    what am I going to say?”</p>
                <p>I loved going to the plants and talking to the managers someone else not from the
                    PR section. I worked at a Sikorsky helicopter plant one summer in college,
                    worked on the production line. The best plant tours are always from a manager,
                    engineer or foreman. You want someone who knows the business and the plant
                    floor. A PR person knows a script. The foreman can really knows what's going on,
                    what it takes to keep production and quality up, and also some time perspective
                    on changes at the facility. The most impressive thing for me in Japanese plants
                    for all the excellence of the Japanese work force was that every plant I went to
                    would start out the briefing with how they were automating further to cut down
                    on labor costs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it apparent at that time that the Japanese had a real

                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Yes, but the automation was being driven by a desire to be more efficient
                    overall. Remember in the 1980s, the Japanese were very confident. Japan seemed
                    to be number one; the economy was booming. Pollution and other such issues
                    popped up in the '60s and '70s, and the government had started to address
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you seeing the change of the social dynamics of
                        women, particularly businesswomen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Yes, but it was still a very conservative society.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They weren't, I mean I remember in Korea when I was there
                        it was somewhat the same thing, people loved working for the American
                        embassy, particularly women did. They were top rate people because if they
                        worked for a Korean business, if they were married they'd have to quit. With
                        us we didn't care.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: That was true when I was in Korea too. And Japan. Big and medium companies
                    let women go when they got married. Of course, women in, both countries did and
                    still do run many small businesses.</p>
                <p>Life was no picnic for men in even big companies. For example, the companies in
                    Tokyo and Osaka would rotate their people to the “provinces.” The big companies
                    had one-room company apartments in Fukuoka for these tours. Families did not
                    want to move the kids around and disrupt their education, when Dad did a
                    two-year tour in Fukuoka.</p>

                <p>KLOTH: Overall she enjoyed Japan and Japanese friends, and still found time to
                    write her PhD dissertation, and have a baby, our son. A lot of the potters in
                    Kyushu came over in the 16th century from Korea, so, while there was some
                    prejudice, in that area, there is also a special relationship.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the American military presence there cause any
                        problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: There are two major bases: the Iwakuni naval air base and the Sasebo navy
                    base, both modest in size. As the economic guy, I wasn't involved directly if
                    there were issues, the consul handled them. People in the area appreciated the
                    security relationship, but criminal incidents or accidents grab headlines. There
                    was one bad incident where a serviceman got into an altercation at a Mr.
                    Doughnut's shop in the middle of the night. The Mr. Doughnut clerk wound up
                    dead, so the consul worked with the base commander to ensure that the citizens
                    of Iwakuni understood U.S. dismay at the incident. Expressions of regret are
                    very important in Japan among Japanese, so it is critical that U.S.
                    representatives be proactive. That is very important.</p>
                <p>In Sasebo, if ships came in some demonstrators would go out in their boats and
                    the Japanese police would be out there; but it was not like the situation in
                    Okinawa. The footprint was pretty small in Kyushu. At least in the Japanese
                    business circles I traveled in throughout the region, I didn't hear concerns
                    about base-related issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were your relations with the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Actually my closest work relationships were with the commercial section of
                    the consulate general in Osaka-Kobe. Our work was not negotiations and policy,
                    but focused on helping U.S. firms come into the market or Japanese firms buy
                    U.S. products, that is, establish relations with U.S. companies. We had a very
                    good and experienced consul in Fukuoka.</p>
                <p>For my commercial work I would go up every six months to Tokyo, and see the
                    American Chamber of Commerce. That's how I learned of Westinghouse wanting to
                    come back to Kyushu. Day in, day out. The Commerce Department's Foreign
                    Commercial Service officer in Osaka was my closest colleague. We talked
                    regularly to exchange ideas and leads.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>We collaborated with Osaka to get more American business people to come down to
                    Fukuoka. The likely candidates were those who already had made the mental leap
                    out of Tokyo and were willing to go to Osaka, that is to the provinces. I had
                    good relations with the Tokyo econ section and FCS. I did a lot of speeches,
                    talked to people and local media, so I needed to know what was going on in the
                    trade negotiations. But in terms of the real work on the commercial side Osaka
                    was the big help.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you left there in '86? Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: I left Fukuoka in the summer of '86. Now I'd finished my first two tours
                    overseas, and so I thought, well, it's time to go back to the States. A friend
                    of mine was working the U.S.-Korean political and diplomatic relations slot on
                    the Korea in the Department. I got a call from the desk asking if I would I like
                    to come back and replace him. The A-100 junior officer class counselor about
                    diversifying, I wondered whether this was a good idea, so I called up my CDO.
                    She immediately said, “That's going to be a great job, take it.” I said, “What
                    about diversification?” She laughed and said, “Well, you're in Japan now; that's
                    Korea.”</p>
                <p>I will confess the one hesitation I had was over what U.S. policy was going to be
                    toward the '87 Korean election. Would a conservative U.S. administration push
                    for a truly democratic process or acquiesce, even collaborate, if Chun Doo-hwan,
                    who was the dictator at the time and president, tried to continue in power in
                    one form or another? Many thought he would, in spite of the one term stipulation
                    in the constitution his government had written. I expected him to try and short
                    circuit this system.</p>
                <p>I wondered whether the Reagan Administration understood how much damage Chun and
                    the perception of U.S. support for him had done to our relations with Koreans in
                    general. I was very concerned that if we got in a situation not perhaps that
                    bloody, but nevertheless where the U.S. was perceived as helping Chun Doo-hwan
                    stay in power through some kind of illegitimate use of force, or manipulation of
                    the system, that this was going to do a lot more damage. If I were the US-Korean
                    bilateral relations desk officer, while not being the decision-maker, I was
                    going to be part of it, ...be up to my ears in supporting a policy I thought
                    wrong.</p>
                <p>I decided, after thinking about it hard, there was another side, that perhaps I
                    could have some influence on this process at a critical time. I was happily
                    surprised when I got to the desk that Desk Director, David Blakemore, Bill
                    Clark, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary, and Assistant Secretary Gaston
                    Sigur, as well as people working at Heritage Foundation, who knew Korea,
                    understood the dangers that we were facing. Chun was unpopular in Korea. In the
                    U.S. Administration, many felt strongly that the time had come for Korea to move
                    on, meaning to have elections that were perceived by Koreans as being really
                    democratic. (I refer readers to the oral histories by Sigur and Clark as well as
                    Harry Dunlop, political counselor in Seoul, then Korea Desk Director from the
                    summer of 1987.)</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>In this case, having a very conservative U.S. administration, in fact meant that
                    we more influence than we would have with a liberal administration. President
                    Chun had based his legitimacy, in part, on his “special” relationship with
                    President Reagan. If President Reagan's conservative administration, was telling
                    Chun to keep his word and step down and to have fair elections, that was very
                    powerful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our interests and concern with South Korea,
                        which we are talking about, in 1986?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: That mid-'80s was a transition period; not only were the politics of Korea
                    changing but also its economic situation. Korea was moving into the “developed”
                    category. In 1969, Korea exported cloth and wigs. By 1986, it was electronics
                    and cars, including cars to the US. Korea hosted the 1988 Olympics. It was their
                    coming-out party on the world stage. The Olympics was also a pressure point for
                    Chun as well. If he did anything that marred the Olympics, that would have been
                    a political disaster.</p>
                <p>Korea now had developed its economy to the point where trade issues with Korea
                    were on the table in meetings of high-level U.S. and Korean officials. It was
                    partly a kind of by- blow from the highly contentious trade relations between
                    Japan and the United States in the '80s, but it also reflected Korea's growth as
                    an economy and success as an exporter. Koreans were advertising Seoul's
                    wonderful preparations for the Olympics, so Americans found it harder to
                    understand why Koreans were keeping in check sales in their country of American
                    products from cars to movies to beef. Koreans' argument that they were still a
                    “developing” country was harder to swallow when people in the U.S. saw Hyundai
                    cars driving our streets. Koreans, of course, were indignant that they should be
                    rolled up with the Japanese as a “protectionist export machine,” although that
                    was the Japanese clone model they were using so effectively. Koreans felt they
                    were still pulling themselves up by their bootstraps, and now we were punishing
                    them for their hard work.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Of course, Korean industries and agriculture were trying to keep the

                <p>KLOTH: Well, the big change, I think, in our view of the North was in the late
                    1970s, we discovered that, while the South was outstripping the North
                    economically, the North Korean army had ballooned up in numbers and equipment.
                    Through much of the '80s, our concern was on the conventional threat. In the
                    late '80s, just as I was leaving the desk, the nuclear threat from the North
                    jumped to the forefront of our concerns.</p>
                <p>When I was on the desk, there was even an effort to reach out to the North, but
                    the North Korean agents blowing up of a South Korean airliner put a tamper to
                    that. We were much concerned about the security of the Olympics and another
                    North Korean attempt to use violence to stop them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah, that's what I'd heard.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: To 1988, where Korea was, if not a developed country, rapidly developing;
                    it was moving from the developing into the developed category.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you know, I've been interviewing Alan Leo who was sort
                        of Olympics officer at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He said, “The Olympics did sort of expose a strain that
                        hadn't been as obvious before and that is anti-Americanism.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, how did we feel about one of the things about
                        Korea getting out from under us was we'd been if not an occupying power I
                        mean we are a very substantial player there which could be resented?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Well, with due respect to Al, anti-Americanism has always been there. I
                    think it came out more publicly in 1988. One thing that did strike me coming
                    back to Washington in '86 was how many Americans of influence didn't seem to
                    realize that there was this other side, that the relationship had a love
                    component and also a hate component or a resentment component.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Out of curiosity what sort of nicknames would you
                        get?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>KLOTH: Perhaps one might compare to some of the unflattering terms used in the
                    New York of the 1950s for any number of ethnic groups. Al is certainly right, I
                    think, that in some incidents at the Olympics, anti-Americanism shot to the
                    surface. The American team walked in the stadium waving rather than marching in
                    lock step, and Koreans reacted badly. Koreans are highly sensitive to their own
                    sense of decorum. Many decided that the Americans were being deliberately
                    disrespectful. Koreans are more self-confident today. I suspect they would react
                    differently to the waving per se, although they are still quick to resent real
                    or perceived slights to their national dignity. I think all the teams wave
                    now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, well, then what was the view when you arrived, I'm
                        trying to capture this, of Chun Doo-hwan, what was going to happen? What did
                        we think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: The concern was that Chun would manipulate the system in a way that would
                    either keep him in the presidency or in a renamed office that would leave him as
                    the ruler of Korea or that he would pass it on to Roh Tae-woo, who was one of
                    the co-conspirators in 1979 and 1980, through a process that was undemocratic.
                    Our hope was: 1) that Chun would, as he had said he would from the beginning,
                    serve one term, and then leave and 2) that most Korean would see the process of
                    electing his successor as democratic, regardless of who won.</p>
                <p>We were also very concerned that Chun would use the military to stay in power or
                    that in another scenario army officers would stage a coup against the widely
                    unpopular President. Then Korea might see bloody resistance and wind up with
                    another dictator. It was all too easy to imagine dire scenarios in which South
                    Koreans used violence against each other, even without North Korean intervention
                    of some kind.</p>
                <p>We were also concerned, of course, about North Korean large or small attacks. The
                    North Koreans had not moved against the South either in 1960 or 1980. Only the
                    North's leaders know why. But if there was some kind of violent conflict going
                    on in the South in 1987, would the North make some violent move?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As one looks at this, one is struck by the fact that the
                        North doesn't come probably because the leaders there are pretty happy with
                        the way things are. If they get into a war, it sounds like they'll grab
                        something, but it's unsettling, and a good chance they would lose. But the
                        way things are, they keep the threat going and keep their generals happy and
                        what the hell.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>KLOTH: Good point. We often forget, but the North Koreans don't, that if the
                    Chinese had not intervened, Korea would have been united as the non-Communist
                    Republic of Korea in 1950. While we may focus and must focus on the potential
                    for them to attack the South, from their point of view a war could also lead to
                    the North being “liberated.” After 1950, they have been careful how they use
                    violence. Deadly but very cautious; now that doesn't mean that this nuclear
                    threat isn't real.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Korean embassy during the time you
                        were on the desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: I got to know my counterparts very well. They were very impressive. The
                    officers I knew went on to become ambassadors and two, foreign ministers. From
                    what I've seen of Korean foreign ministry officials, the U.S. gets the very pick
                    of the crop. The Japanese embassy also gets excellent officers, and I'm sure
                    China sends their best now, too. Koreans appreciated somebody who'd lived in
                    Korea as a Peace Corps volunteer. I think that added a certain bonding element.
                    Kathy Stephens, now our ambassador to South Korea, was a great step forward for
                    the US, because she was a Peace Corps volunteer and could speak Korean. In spite
                    of Korea's importance, she's the first Korean-speaking U.S. ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find, I mean this was not at your level, it was a
                        level or two above, but was there a problem that Korea was sort of in
                        competition with Japan and China for attention in the Asian bureau and that
                        Korea would take a third place or not? Or did you have any feeling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Japan and China are the big fish, of course. That said, my experience with
                    the Department is the focus goes on where there is a crisis. Korea got plenty of
                    attention right up to the White House the closer we got to the election. If a
                    memo I wrote went up to the Undersecretary or Secretary or even to the White
                    House, it was read. The feedback that we'd get on various issues showed that
                    high level people were thinking hard about Korea, trying to make the right
                    policy decision.</p>
                <p>Whether they thought about Korea “more” than Japan or China, I couldn't say.
                    Certainly once the 1988 Korean election was over peacefully, and Roh Tae-woo's
                    victory seemed to have been accepted by Koreans, interest at the top dropped
                    off. I wasn't getting calls for quick updates to the White House the way I had
                    before. But that was typical of the way the Department operates. It's a big
                    world. There's plenty to worry about at the top. If an issue seems settleat
                    least for the momenit's time to focus on what isn't settled. In Korea desk's
                    case, support for a successful Seoul Olympics and North Korea quickly took
                    center stage. Check Harry Dunlop's oral history. I left the Korea desk for Japan
                    desk in summer 1988, but Harry stayed on as director.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a bit more about how U.S. policy developed
                        during the time before the Korean election of '87?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Yeah, it was '87. Well, Gaston Sigur made clear in his February ' 87 Asia
                    Society speech that the U.S. government expected President Chun to keep his
                    promise that the next change of government in South Korea would be a democratic
                    one and the Korean military would also stay out of politics. I was gratified,
                    since I wrote the speech. In late fall we knew this speech was on his calendar
                    in February, and Desk Director David Blakemore thought the speech should be an
                    important statement of policy before what we expected to be a hot spring in
                    Seoul. Spring is the student demonstration season. We saw the potential for an
                    escalation into violence. Given Chun's unpopularity, demonstrations might well
                    grow, in which case Chun might use the military to stay in power or might
                    himself be overthrown by a coup. The North Koreans might seek to take advantage
                    in some violent way as well. On the plus side, a successful 1988 Olympics was
                    tremendously important to the majority of South Koreans and that, we hoped,
                    would be a powerful force for responsible behavior by Chun and his
                    colleagues.</p>
                <p>David asked me to take a crack at doing the speech. I'd drafted quite a few
                    remarks and talking points for high level meetings in the fall, so used them as
                    a guide. When David read my first draft and said, “Okay, but I think we should
                    be even more a frank. Go back, and give me what you really think we ought to say
                    now. Don't worry about staying within the lines of what was approved for us to
                    say up to now.”</p>
                <p>I did. I heard later through the grapevine that a number of folks up the line
                    cleared with a bit of hesitation about potential negative reaction among some
                    U.S. conservative politicians. The speech was well received by many in Korea and
                    the U.S. who knew Korea and were worried about the consequences of Chun trying
                    to cling to power. Secretary Shultz on his March trip to Seoul reiterated that
                    what Assistant Secretary Sigur said was what the Reagan administration believed
                    it was time for a change.</p>
                <p>In the end we'll never really know why Chun did what he did, what weight U.S.
                    policy had on him. I think the key element in the change as we look back was the
                    feeling of Koreans of all political stripes that Korea had grown beyond
                    dictatorship. The economy and society had grown beyond where people were willing
                    to accept strong-man government necessary for development and holding the Reds
                    at bay, Park and Chun's mantra, and one that through the 1970s, even early
                    1980s, had some popular appeal. The large demonstrations in the spring and the
                    support that ordinary Koreans gave to them gave expression to the demand for
                    change.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>The embassy did a terrific job in keeping us informed as well as keeping the heat
                    on Chun. Ambassador Lilley was terrific. These days there's a tendency to
                    underestimate the importance of the “reporting” function and to see advocating
                    of “doing” as separate from reporting. I agree political officers, in
                    particular, have to be aggressive advocates of U.S. policies, implementers may
                    be a better word in some countries. Nevertheless, instantaneous Internet access
                    to media reports from around the world doesn't negate the importance of good
                    reporting from our posts about what is happening and what it means for U.S.
                    policy. We need to know what programs are working and what aren't. Indeed, the
                    Internet information waterfall we're sitting under makes it even more important
                    that we have political and economic officers on the spot backed up by post
                    leadership giving us focused views on key issues. Washington also needs to know
                    what posts are saying to different people and how they are reacting. Embassy
                    Seoul did a superb job through the spring. You don't get that kind of thoughtful
                    reporting that supports policy at crucial times from other agencies, let alone
                    the media. It's a vital skill we develop in FSOs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we seeing signs of a government moving toward either
                        a coup of some kind or rigging the elections?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Well, we were very afraid that the system that the government was going to
                    use with a sort of stacked electoral college was not going to result in a
                    democratic change. A huge concern was always about the Korean military and what
                    was going on there. In spite of the long and close relationship between U.S.
                    Forces Korea and the Korean military, we didn't have confidence in our ability
                    to see a coup coming.</p>
                <p>I knew a number of the people around town at CIA and DIA, so I convened at the
                    Department a regular meeting, including very much our own INR, about once a
                    month where we would sit down together and discuss our views of the situation.
                    The goal was to ensure that information or analysis that one or the other of us
                    were working on got around fast. Our meetings also ensured the intel agency
                    working-level folks were up to date on policy-side thinking. The goal wasn't to
                    pound anyone into place. We all knew each other too well. That wasn't going to
                    happen, but to be sure we considered all the angles. We also operated on the
                    rule that we could, indeed should, tell our bosses what we learned but not who
                    said what. I think it was very effective in helping us to understand what we
                    knew and didn't know as we went forward.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>Another issue was press guidance. The Park and Chun governments had been quite
                    skillful in manipulating United States' government statements to convey the
                    impression that the U.S. supported in them. So in looking at how we did press
                    guidance I felt and was able to persuade others that in tense situations press
                    guidance should be shorter rather than longer. The longer a piece was the more
                    opportunity you give people to cut and paste and create a position they want
                    their people to think the U.S. has taken. Then when we go in to complain, they
                    say, “Look, here are the words in your guidance.” By having shorter press
                    guidance you deprive them of that opportunity, although admittedly there are
                    times when you want to obfuscate. Then longer may be better. While the Internet
                    age gives access to our original statement, it also enables those not our
                    friends to disseminate their version faster, so I suspect the principle still
                    holds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I say this is very important because going back in history
                        I've interviewed Marshall Greene. Back in, I think, '61, when Park Chung Hee
                        had his coup and took over; most of our military and all was delighted with
                        it. Marshall Green happened to be charge, the ambassador was absent, and
                        Greene, the DCM, had no instructions, and went out and stated what our
                        policy has always been: we support a democratic government. Well, the thing
                        was a lot of our military and others in the United States, because it was a
                        very weak democratic government at that time, were delighted that ROK
                        General Park Chung Hee was taking over. Marshall Greene was left sort of
                        swinging in the wind without much support. It's an interesting episode in
                        our oral histories.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Throughout our long relationship with Korea that's been another underlying
                    challenge. We have to make sure that our military as well as diplomats in our
                    public statements as well as our other interactions with Koreans are sending the
                    same message.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well how did things play out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: The demonstrations grew through the spring of 1987, and finally the
                    government said, “Yes, we are going to have a direct election.”</p>
                <p>Roh Tae-woo, a former general and co-conspirator in the 1980 coup, ran for the
                    government party and won the fall election. Our feeling was that the government
                    decision in June was based on the political pressure of popular support for the
                    demonstrators and on an accurate analysis of the Korean political scene. Kim Dae
                    Jung and Kim Young Sam, the two chief opposition leaders who had suffered under
                    Park Chung Hee and then under Chun Doo-hwan, both ran for President, splitting
                    the opposition vote and ensuring Roh's victory. Roh also ran a serious campaign.
                    I heard his speech at the U.S. National Press Club in the fall of 1987 that was
                    a skillful political speech. I heard then former President Chun speak in New
                    York in winter of 1988, and his speech was quite a contrast to Roh's of the
                    fall.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the difference?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Chun's was very tough minded. He was almost belligerent defending the coup
                    makers' abuse of force in Kwangju in 1980, sort of they got what they asked for.
                    In particular with regard to Kwangju he seemed to see the people in Kwangju who
                    had opposed his coup, as having been if not in league with the North, clearly
                    aiding and abetting, so argued the government's reaction was in evitable and had
                    to be very tough. When Roh talked about Kwangju, he emphasized his regret, as I
                    recall, that Koreans had wound up fighting with Koreans. He was much more
                    astute, running as he was in a much more open and democratic election, than Chun
                    ever had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we view Roh Tae-woo? Were we thinking of him as
                        being a transitional figure or was this a continuation of a dictatorship by
                        another name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Roh Tae-woo had gotten elected by a democratic process because his two
                    rivals divided the opposition vote. Whether if they had united, those who were
                    running the Korean government would have tried in some way to subvert the
                    election, stuff the ballot boxes, what have you, to make sure that Roh Tae-woo
                    won, we'll never know. The two Kims couldn't bring themselves to uniting, so the
                    regional nature of Korean politics meant the opposition vote was split, and Roh
                    won.</p>
                <p>What was the Reagan Administration's attitude toward Roh Tae-woo? Korean
                    politicians over the years had often come to Washington, although Kim Young Sam
                    didn't come often at all. He didn't seem to have much of an organization here.
                    Kim Dae Jung and his supporters were very active. The opposition in Korea saw
                    the Democratic Party in the United States as a close ally against the Korean
                    dictatorship. The Republican Party tended to be very concerned with the
                    Communist threat. Korean government officials and conservative politicians
                    played skillfully on that. Also at a political level that wasn't directly
                    related to dictatorship, the Republicans tended to see the right in South Korean
                    politics as people who more in common political point of view, just as the
                    Democrats tended toward and were cultivated by the Korean opposition.</p>
                <p>So there seemed to be a sense of relief in the Reagan Administration that Roh
                    Tae-woo had won both from the point of view of an orderly transition but also
                    from the point of view of his being a “conservative.” But make no mistake, the
                    relief was also rooted in the fact that the process had been a democratic
                    one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any effort on our part...I'm speaking about with
                        the embassy, State Department or our American military tell the two Kim's
                        why don't you get your act together and let's not put another general in or
                        were we just kind of saying well, let's let the chips lay where the
                        fall?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>KLOTH: It was obvious to us and our people in the embassy as well as the Korean
                    press and the Korean body politic that both running meant both would lose.
                    Koreans knew these two well enough to realize their ambition, not a Korean or
                    U.S. government plot created that situation, so in the end it didn't undermine
                    the legitimacy of the election.</p>
                <p>Let me speak a little more about life of a desk officer. Part of my job was to
                    talk with the Korean embassy as well as with any government or opposition
                    representatives in Washington. I was encouraged reach out to NGOs concerned
                    about Korean policies in the human rights area as well as to think tanks across
                    the political spectrum. I did that, and also got to know key Congressional
                    staffers like Stanley Roth, later assistant secretary, who was working for
                    Congressman Steve Solarz, who had a very active role in East Asian policy in the
                    House. There were various individuals on the Senate side too who were in
                    touch.</p>
                <p>That was in no means a criticism of the excellent embassy reporting, but we also
                    felt that we needed to work with people who were concerned and active in the US,
                    that we ought to be talking to them directly to ensure they understood
                    Administration's views and we theirs. The expectation was that we would disagree
                    on some issues but each side should know the other's position, so we were
                    engaging on real issues, not misperceptions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a significant group in Congress, I'm thinking
                        particularly of the right wing who were close to our military? I was there
                        in '76-'79. The general made these comments at the time sort of kicked out I
                        can't think of it, but anyway...</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Singlaub, yeah. Was there a sort of hard core within the
                        staff and maybe particularly the Senate saying well we've got to support

                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: No, my impression was that the Administration's policy had good support
                    among the conservative community. I think there was a broad feeling among
                    conservatives too that Korea had come of age.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: As with Park Chung Hee, so with Chun Doo-hwan, the economic side, economic
                    growth and development, were so important that Chun Doo-hwan continued to use
                    civilian economic technocrats. Former military men were certainly given nice
                    jobs, including ambassadorships, but economic results were number one.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In many ways, I think Park Chung Hee set Korea on a course
                        that has never deviated and that is really for real growth and despite all
                        the general dictatorships and all they haven't messed with it. In fact,
                        they've done the positive things on the economy, which turned Korea into a
                        prosperous country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Ambassador Dixie Walker, my first Ambassador as an FSO in 1982, said to me
                    once that there were more American PhDs. in the Korean government than in the
                    American government. It was a very technocratic approach to economic
                    development. Chun and then Roh Tae-woo continued that. I returned in 1990, and,
                    of course, there was the next round of democratization when Kim Young Sam joined
                    the government party and won the presidency following Roh Tae-woo, but the
                    economic technocrats continued to be the key policy and implementation
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things back to just what you were saying that
                        there has been much talk about the Chicago boys in Chile who went to the
                        University of Chicago and came back and even under the dictatorship in
                        Chile. They brought Chicago economics, which was very successful, but Korea
                        has certainly benefited by people who went to the United States and took
                        their business courses.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: True, although Koreans value PhD's highly. The economic heavy hitters in
                    government had doctorates by and large. That's one thing that has long
                    fascinated me with the Korean case; they were trained in the United States and
                    then came back to Korea. But clearly the model that they were using was the
                    Japanese modethe government planned and supported the development of private
                    companies to implement growth. Resentment of Japanese colonialism was there, but
                    they saw Japan rebuilding rapidly after WW II, so they used a Japanese-type
                    model of government-planned development based on private firms.</p>
                <p>Korean protectionism kept out U.S. firms and that became a trade issue in the
                    1980s when Korea shifted from a developing to a developed country. But every
                    Korean I know saw that as first a policy of making sure Japanese didn't dominate
                    their economy, a feeling very much fed by their experience as a colony of Japan
                    before 1945.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>The relationships after 1945 were, however, complex. The new generation got U.S.
                    educations, but many who had been to schools in Korea during the colonial period
                    had been to school with Japanese. These personal connections continued. I've
                    talked to Japanese who went through high school in Seoul. They had Korean
                    classmates. Through the 1980s and 1990s, they would have school reunions in
                    Korea. So these kinds of connections were very much there and were a factor in
                    business and government as Korea's economy developed. Another interesting aspect
                    of the PhD-drive after 1945 was that Koreans came to the U.S. for graduate
                    school in far, far greater numbers than went to Japan. Koreans were still
                    impressed with a Tokyo University PhD, reportedly harder to get than one from
                    Harvard, but a Korean I know who graduated from Tokyo U. said that he felt
                    Koreans kept him at a distance at work; he was considered very smart but a bit
                    tainted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the Korean context high school classmates are very
                        important even more than college.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Right. And Korean and Japanese are similar languages, so a Korean can
                    learn Japanese relatively easily like an American learning Spanish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about, again from your perspective, on the desk, the
                        China connection, what was happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Our focus was primarily on Korea. South Korea and China had no formal
                    relations. We, however, encouraged not only China but also the Russians to have
                    discussions and to develop relations with the South Koreans. I think the
                    Chinese, in particular, were interested in South Korea as an economic growth
                    model and potential partner. China too had suffered from colonialism, especially
                    Japanese colonialism, and by the 1980s, Korea was clearly a model of successful
                    economic development, especially when compared to North Korea, China's erstwhile
                    ally. South Korea had a lot of lessons to teach. By the early 1990s, China was
                    willing to establish diplomatic relations with Seoul. So was Moscow.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: We encouraged the two to talk and to build a relationship with South
                    Korea. For the Korea desk the challenge was how to draw North Korea out of its
                    shell and into peaceful interaction with the South and the international
                    community, including the U.S.</p>

                    Korea, as I recall, and we weren't getting much. There were few defectors from
                    North Korea and remarkably little information coming out, if you compare it back
                    to the old Soviet Union or Eastern Europe.</p>

                        else?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Probably, but I had focused on South Korea and was plenty busy.</p>
                <p>In the summer of '88, I moved to Japan desk to work on trade. At that time,
                    U.S.-Japan trade issues were highly contentious and had been for over a decade.
                    When I first came to Washington in '80, at seminar at the University of Maryland
                    one weekend, I heard a UAW rep, Ford lobbyist, and Toyota lobbyist discuss the
                    problems of the U.S. auto industry and its demands for the U.S. government to
                    stop Japanese imports into the US. People asked the Ford and the UAW reps if
                    limiting competition would just enable the U.S. auto industry to continue to
                    develop unpopular products and so take the pressure off it to become competitive
                    in the U.S. and world markets. I remember one or the other of them said very
                    frankly, “That's a legitimate, but the political pressure from inside the
                    industry and the union is such that we will demand the U.S. government to do
                    it.”</p>
                <p>Predictably, of course, the “voluntary” limits on Japanese cars led the Japanese
                    auto industry to bring in higher value vehicles which were head to head with
                    even more of the U.S., industries' models. If you're limited in number of units,
                    you want higher profits per unit, so that Japanese reaction was easy to
                    anticipate and led to the price of Japanese cars going higher without lowering
                    demand because Americans were willing to pay the premium for a better product.
                    The U.S. industry did bring some better products like the Taurus, but two
                    decades later only Ford management seems competitive.</p>
                <p>The upside for U.S. workers is that major Japanese, Korean and German makers
                    build cars here. The irony is that in the late '70s, though, a Japanese banker
                    told me that U.S. trade pressure gave Japanese auto firms the excuse to override
                    “keep-jobs-in-Japan” politicians and bureaucrats and build plants hera move that
                    made economic sensarguing that Japanese firms did so only “to escape U.S.
                    protectionism.”</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>At any rate, the political antagonism to the Japanese, who were running
                    protectionist policies, make no mistake, was high. When I moved from Korea desk
                    to Japan desk, a Congressional staffer I knew well warned me, “Ted, our
                    relationship is going to change. Don't take it personally, and you've been
                    really helpful to me and my Senator. But the feeling up here on the Hill, the
                    antagonism over these trade issues means that when you move to Japan desk, and
                    we talk, it's not going to be in the consultative kind of way that we've talked
                    up to now. The nickname on the Hill for State's Japan desk is 'the second
                    Japanese embassy.'"</p>
                <p>I could understand. The U.S. was running a large trade deficit with the Japanese,
                    and the Japanese had continued protectionist their policies developed after
                    World War II to rebuild their economy. By the '70s and '80s, Japanese industries
                    were internationally competitive. The auto industry comes to mind but others
                    such as ship building and electronics were doing very, very well, so the
                    protections that had been erected became an obvious economic issue in terms of
                    U.S. products being able to have access to the Japanese market in the same way
                    their products had access to our market.</p>
                <p>It was a complex picture because there were some restrictions that were pure
                    politics. The government party depended on rural voters, so there were zero rice
                    imports, not a big U.S. export, but beef was, and beef imports were tightly
                    controlled.</p>
                <p>There were also other issues such as standards which were kind of a second level
                    of obstacles to foreign importers. The issue was whether or not, for instance,
                    safety standards for construction materials were drawn up in such a way that
                    manufacturers in Japan had an unfair advantage. Japanese standards were set in
                    centimeters. A board needed to be X by X centimeters to meet code. The issue was
                    whether an X by X inch board from the U.S. could bear the same load. If you
                    specified in terms of load-bearing rather than linear measurement, it was better
                    for U.S. saw mills, and Japanese consumers. Japan demanded clinical trials in
                    Japan for medicines.</p>
                <p>Standards got the U.S. government's attention as an issue from around 1980, when
                    a U.S. baseball bat manufacturer complained to our economic/commercial officer
                    in Osaka that his metal bats were “not up to code in Japan” because the code had
                    been deliberately set to ensure only Japanese bats would qualify. He had done
                    all the right things in Japan in terms of coming to Japan and building
                    relationships with potential purchasers and having a good product at a good
                    price. The American bats did not meet Japanese specifications because they were
                    not milled on the inside, which made no difference to safety or performance but
                    was a requirement of the Japanese standard, and there was strong suspicion,
                    given the collaboration between Japanese government and industry, that this had
                    been set to keep U.S. bats out.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>Further investigation revealed that the standards issue was a big one for many
                    U.S. products, even when the Japanese bureaucrats were not trying to be
                    deliberately protectionist. They too often set specifications in terms of form
                    rather than function. Other issues such as the relationships between the banks
                    and the large Japanese companies emerged. Negotiations started with the Japanese
                    on a full range of these complex problems, including the value of the Yen.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Well, I had automobiles, construction, and others, including the so-called
                    large scale retail store law. This law was developed to protect mom and pop
                    stores in Japan, which were the largest number of stores and so the largest
                    number of voters, from competition with Japanese department stores, but also
                    hurt U.S. firms like Toy 'R U.S. trying to enter the market. There were similar,
                    it turns out, laws in places like Germany. We never had American companies
                    complain about them, just as we never had American companies complain about the
                    German auto industry. After World War II, the Europeans had let U.S. firms back
                    in, and Japan had kept them out.</p>

                <p>KLOTH: Later I discovered Australia is highly restrictive on imports of
                    automobiles, but Ford and GM long ago opened plants in the country. Restrictions
                    on autos not made in Australia served their interests too.</p>

                        obviously part of the team, make any progress and how did you deal with
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) is the one who leads the American team,
                    although that office sometimes agrees to a delegation of work. Department of
                    Commerce, for instance, led a team trying to open the Japanese government
                    construction market to internationally competitive bidding</p>
                <p>In the midst of my time on Japan desk, we had a transition from Reagan to Bush I.
                    In terms of watching Secretary Baker and his team move into the Department, one
                    would have thought that would have been seamless, given one Republican was
                    replacing another. In fact, I recall it as being a time of some stress for those
                    at levels closer to the secretary than I was as a desk officer, but that stress
                    was passed on down.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>Secretary Baker moved into the Department rather quickly, as I recall. He had an
                    office on the first floor, the transition office, and people were very favorably
                    impressed both by the team members they met and by the new Secretary-to-be's own
                    demeanor. I remember our OMS (Office Management Specialist) came back one day
                    very excited. She had been in the lunch line, and the Secretary designate had
                    been right behind her.</p>
                <p>When the transition actually took place, although Secretary Baker had a very
                    sharp team he brought from Treasury where he had been under Reagan, the seventh
                    floor (where the Secretary has his office) seemed uninterested in much of the
                    Department's work. Only a few issues like Russia interested them, so no guidance
                    on many issues was coming out. Morale went down.</p>
                <p>In EAP, however, we had a new Deputy Assistant Secretary for economic affairs,
                    Robert Fauvre from Treasury, so we in EAP/J felt we were in the loop on the new
                    U.S.-Japan Structural Impediments Initiative (SII). Treasury developed the SII
                    as a comprehensive approach to move beyond the individual item by item
                    negotiations that seemed endless. In addition to talking to the Japanese about
                    individual issues brought up by individual companies, we would look at six areas
                    where the structure of the Japanese system impeded foreign companies coming in.
                    They included a broad range of issues from the relationships between companies
                    and banks to the distribution system (defined as everything customs to the
                    large-scale department store law) to price differentials.</p>
                <p>Price differentials, led by Commerce, turned out to be a great one from the
                    public relations point of view. You could often buy Japanese products cheaper in
                    the United States than in Japan, but U.S. products would be more expensive in
                    Japan than in the US.Up until the early '70s, Japanese aware of this thought is
                    a necessary measure to keep consumption low and investment high. Further, as a
                    resource poor nation Japan had to import things like oil and pay for them in
                    dollars gained through exports. This was the development model they had and was
                    widely accepted.</p>
                <p>By the late '80s, Japan had been doing very well for decades, and Japanese were
                    starting to do things like travel with families. They wanted a reward for their
                    hard work and thought they had earned it. When a Commerce Department and
                    Japanese counterpart survey was done, and the results got into the Japanese
                    media, the Japanese public and media response was, “Yeah, why are we paying so
                    much more for this or that?”</p>
                <p>It was not all the result of policy to make imports more expensive. When we
                    looked, for example, at the distribution system, all these small mom and pop
                    stores need more frequent deliveries. So, of course, there is a cost for that.
                    Our argument was that the restrictions of the large-scale department store law
                    made it very difficult for a new large store like Toys 'R Us to set up in Japan
                    and bring goods at lower prices to Japanese consumers. There were other issues
                    too, the question of how long it took to come through the ports to get through
                    all the customs and other clearances.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at it did you find that the customs clearances
                        were just trying to stall rather than to do what one should do, necessary
                        operations or a lot of other things like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Well, we found Japanese Customs was an unexpected ally. The Japanese
                    Customs did not have the latest information technology and was way behind U.S.
                    Customs not only in the technology but in the use of technology. For example,
                    they had not developed as sophisticated set of risk-evaluating algorithms,
                    including input of intelligence information, as U.S. Customs had. Japanese
                    Customs realized that their government's agreement to our “demand” for faster
                    processing could force the Finance Ministry to fund modernization of their
                    data-processing system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If you examine these two different systems, this is sort
                        of the American perspective in reading about this in the various newspaper
                        accounts. You have the feeling that the American system is basically
                        practical; the Japanese was designed to keep things out. I mean did you come
                        away with this impression?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: True. But other factors were also at work. In Fukuoka the head of the
                    local office of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (at the time
                    called MITI) said, “Japanese have much more of a sense that the government is
                    responsible for the quality of products that they buy as well as for the
                    organization of a host of other things in society. It's a big problem for the
                    government, if something comes in that turns out to be problematic.”</p>
                <p>Listening to Japanese officials in countless meetings, I realized that in many
                    areas they were already much more worried about Chinese than U.S. imports. China
                    in the 1980s was just gaining steam, but the Japanese were quite prescient in
                    seeing quality issues coming. Look at U.S. reaction to lead in the paint of kids
                    toys from China! For example, if Japan accepted U.S. test results for
                    pharmaceuticals or even construction materials, they would open themselves up to
                    great pressure in the future when China wanted to send exports to Japan. Lately
                    Americans have been criticizing a lack of import testing here.</p>
                <p>Fundamentally, the Japanese were frustrated by our attitude. “When we sell you
                    our products, we find out what the U.S. requirement is, and we manufacture to
                    the requirement. Now why don't your firms manufacture to our requirement?”</p>
                <p>Our manufacturers responded, “Because you restrict our ability to sell in
                    quantity in many different ways, so it's too expensive.”</p>
                <p>Starts too sound like the chicken and the egg in some aspects, but in the end the
                    U.S. is a bigger market, so foreign companies are go meet our standards.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Japanese and the European Community demanding
                        kind of the same things or had our trade gotten so sophisticated with the
                        European Community that it wasn't an issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: We had some issues with Europe, but nothing of the scale of friction with
                    Japan. There were issues, for example, European government support for Aerobus.
                    In the case of Japan, there were so many issues. It was so broad and so deep
                    that it was a major negative element in the relationship and very serious.</p>
                <p>So many members of Congress had industries in their districts that felt they were
                    unfairly disadvantaged trying to export to Japan, which was by the '80s a large
                    potential market. Certainly the beef, a highly symbolic issue, and the autos
                    were infuriating for many Americans. Japanese would talk about the “cultural”
                    importance of rice to Japan. In fact, the United States was not going to export
                    very much rice. The Japanese were much more concerned about rice coming in from
                    Southeast Asia. Americans could make both a “cultural” as well as economic
                    argument about autos or beef for America. The political chemistry was bad.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: We worked closely with USTR and our embassy because there was no USTR
                    representative in Tokyo. At a larger policy level our DAS in '88 Bill Pease, who
                    was replaced by Bob Fauvre, said well. Our job at State was to be sure that one,
                    issues identified as targets for negotiations with the Japanese were of real
                    importance to the United States, given that the U.S.-Japan relations were
                    critical to U.S. security as well as economic interests. Two, as the prime U.S.
                    experts on Japan and the dynamics of Japanese government and business, the Japan
                    desk and our embassy had to work actively to develop strategies that led to real
                    results for U.S. business, and to minimize the kind of nasty political
                    posturing, and huffing and puffing that some in DC agencies were tempted into
                    simply to score points in the U.S. domestic process. Trade fights hurt our
                    relations with Japan, a close ally. We had to make sure the benefits were worth
                    the price we paid. I found the biggest challenge to your diplomatic skills was
                    working in the Washington interagency process, not foreign capitals.</p>
                <p>I guess my own quick and dirty on trade issues is that I'm hard pressed to think
                    of a trade or an economic issue that is really an economic issue. They're
                    political issues. In general, tariffs or quotas whether in Japan or the U.S. are
                    the result of political decisions. The United States does not restrict sugar
                    imports into our country from abroad because it makes economic sense, unless you
                    are a sugar crop producer.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: No. At State in '82, when I joined, there were two big things on the minds
                    of the people running our A-100 incoming officers' basic course. They were
                    mid-level and upper mid-level officers, an 0-3 and an 0-1. One was the question
                    of leaking. These officers, if they had not been in Vietnam, had certainly been
                    in the Vietnam era Foreign Service. They and more than a few senior officials,
                    who addressed us, emphasized that you have an obligation within the walls of the
                    Department to put forward vigorously the position that you think the U.S. should
                    follow. But once a decision has been made on what that U.S. position would be,
                    your job is to advance that position. That includes defending it on the Hill and
                    defending it to the media.</p>
                <p>If you disagree with it, then you have a number of options. One is to just
                    proceed forward. If you feel that your disagreement is at a level where you
                    cannot in good personal conscience continue to defend it, then you should either
                    seek another job in the Department or you should resign. Those seemed reasonable
                    terms of employment to me.</p>
                <p>Further, while there are different motives for and results of leaks, my
                    experience was that in most cases with the issues I worked over my career,
                    leakers were trying to subvert agreed policy or gain advantage outside the
                    process when their arguments were unpersuasive in the process. That struck me as
                    sleazy. If you don't like the policy for whatever reason, move to a different
                    job or quit, then go public if you're so moved. Maybe I was just lucky; perhaps
                    deliberations on the issues that I worked on didn't produce a result so
                    disagreeable that I felt tempted to leak.</p>
                <p>The other thing that was much on their minds was the Iran hostage taking, because
                    this was March 1982, so there were people in the training world who knew people
                    who had been hostages. Bruce Langdon came and spoke to our group about the
                    Middle East and about being a hostage. It was also made very clear to us that
                    the U.S. government was not going to negotiate for our release, and that meant
                    that might increase the chances of your being killed or held a long time. The
                    Department wanted everybody in the class to think this through and be sure you
                    really wanted to be part of the service.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1990 where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>KLOTH: After finishing my tour on Japan desk in 1990, I went back to Seoul. I was
                    in the embassy for three years as the head of the internal political section. In
                    the portfolio were relations with Korean politicians and the National Assembly,
                    in particular, and relations with university academics and NGOs, even the media.
                    I wasn't trying to do the work of the public affairs section, but to better
                    understand the dynamics of Korean politics and society by talking with people
                    who had a broad range of contacts and perspectives. I also had a mandate from
                    our front office to be proactive in ensuring the politicians and others I met
                    with understood U.S. policy. Koreans might agree or disagree, and the goal was
                    to increase the number of those who agreed, or at least, if they disagreed,
                    understood our policies. Too often politicians and the Korean media out f
                    ignorance or for their own political purposes portrayed the choices as
                    zero-su“U.S. wins; Korea loses.”</p>
                <p>Trade issues had become big, for example. The Uruguay Round was entering a
                    critical stage, so Koreans would ask me about that. North Korea was also heating
                    up and Koreans had a variety of opinions about what South Korean and U.S. policy
                    should be. As a political officer I had two jobs: to advocate U.S. positions and
                    to report how local politics and how that process would affect our
                    interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was our ambassador at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Don Gregg was ambassador in 1990.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, let's talk about the Seoul time. You'd been away for
                        a while and they had a real election. Talk about the changed political
                        environment that you were dealing with.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Korean politics and the way the government operated were much more open
                    and democratic, reflecting the new dynamics of Korean society and Korea's
                    economy. Koreans were living better; wages had taken a big jump in '88 as part
                    of the democratization process, which capped the economic development of the
                    '70s and 80s.</p>
                <p>The jump in car ownership was a highly visible symbol of those changes. When I
                    first went there in 1969, only affluent people could afford to cars. I was
                    startled in 1990, going out to Seoul National University to visit some professor
                    friends to see row after row of brand new cars parked on campus. One professor
                    began by saying, “I bet you noticed all those new cars. They aren't owned by
                    professors but by students. Dad or mom gave their kids a car when they got into
                    SNU, because that's a big deal. The students often maintain the cars using the
                    money they earn tutoring high school kids (a college students' usual part-time
                    job with a long tradition). In Korea that is very lucrative and always has been.
                    Back in the days when Koreans were much poorer, I certainly knew more than a few
                    students of very, very modest means who funded their college educations by
                    tutoring. I'm sure many still do, but today some use the money for cars.”</p>

                    universities. Yonsei or Korea Universities, private schools, probably come next.
                    Koreans will go down a list with much less variation than in the U.S.. After
                    all, it's a smaller country, but it also has a tradition of rankings that is
                    strong. Where you go pretty much determines a person's upper and lower limits in
                    terms of future jobs and more.</p>

                    at FSI. One of the old hands mentioned that when he'd entered State as an FSO in
                    the mid-'60s, he was a beneficiary of the “first equal opportunity program” at
                    the Department. Congress asked why so many FSOs were Ivy Leaguers and so few
                    graduates of state universities.</p>

                        mass infusion of Main Streeters. In a way having been working on this oral
                        history program with people who are results of this, one of the things that
                        is hidden is that the GI Bill and the post World War II group that came in
                        really came from quite a variety of places. In fact, in interviewing people
                        who reached ambassadorial rank or the equivalent, the great majority, which
                        still holds today but it's obviously on its last legs, is that the parents
                        of the people I'm interviewing were probably not college graduates. That's a
                        social thing that is changing.</hi>

                <p>KLOTH: You look back before World War II; I think there were sixty independent
                    countries because, of course, this was the colonial era. In turn, the Foreign
                    Service had what 300-400 people or something like that, very small, which also
                    reflected that if you had an ambassador in every capital, you would have only
                    sixty ambassadors; then you would have consul generals in some of the colonies
                    as well as cities in the home countries. There was a consul general in Seoul,
                    but these were very small operations. Inside capitals and out we certainly
                    didn't have all the programs, including assistance and security cooperation
                    programs, we have now. Then after World War II, there was a burst of growth in
                    independent countries and aid programs and so in our overseas missions and
                    people to staff them; my father recalled that before he left the Navy in 1947,
                    the word went out encouraging officers to apply to the Foreign Service.</p>

                    and that's above the Mason-Dixon Line. Then, of course, women officers, if they

                <p>KLOTH: In an effort to get more diversity, the exam has also changed over the
                    last four decades too. I took it my senior in college in '68. I just missed
                    passing. My recollection was regretting I hadn't taken a diplomatic history
                    course because it clearly seemed very much written by and for people who had. I
                    then went off in other directions. When I took it in the early '80s, it was very
                    wide open. People ask me what to do to prepare for it. “Read your newspapers
                    every day.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, anyway back to Korea.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Back to Korea. In 1990, Korea was very different. Folks were more
                    prosperous, and they were reaping the rewards of their hard work. I mentioned
                    the cars at Seoul National University; obviously that is the higher end. But in
                    Ulsan, with the big Hyundai shipyard, higher end blue collar workers were going
                    around on motorbikes. If you wandered around the back streets of Seoul's
                    Yongdungp'o, there were a lot of small machine tool shops. These were one or two
                    guys with a power drill making parts, perhaps auto parts, as sub-contractors,
                    very humble kinds of places. But you'd see TV aerials on roof tops. People were
                    well fed and clothed. In '69, you would see poor people, clearly not as well
                    fed, but also wearing cast off military uniforms. By the 1990s, people were
                    wearing work clothes that were not cast off military uniforms, so all these
                    little things were signs of a better quality of life. I don't mean there was no
                    poverty or that working conditions weren't often terrible, but by the 1990s
                    Koreans felt confident enough in their future to worry about things like the
                    environment.</p>
                <p>With a more open political system, there were TV investigative reports about
                    things like pollution, water pollution, industrial waste being dumped into the
                    river systems. Prior to this time, a story occasionally might pop up on such
                    problems, and then it would disappear - censored. University professors and
                    folks in NGOs told me that the government didn't want to hear about pollution in
                    the '70s and the early '80s. Most people were just focused on living a little
                    better, so it wasn't a case of censorship bucking much popular sentiment. Rapid
                    economic growth was accepted widely as the number one prioritor maybe number two
                    after being sure the North Koreans wouldn't start another war.</p>
                <p>Talking to people in Korea's business world, I discovered that many companies
                    were and had been thinking ahead. If, say, a company put up a brand new TV
                    factory, it would put in anti- pollution equipment, because it was cheaper to do
                    so at the start, than five years later if government policy changed. Guys
                    running the big companies and even many medium-sized ones could see change
                    coming. They traveled on business and were well informed. Ironically, I was told
                    when I visited one plant in the early '90s, the government told the manager not
                    to use his anti-pollution equipment because it increased electricity
                    consumption. They didn't care if he was willing to pay. Limited supply worried
                    them as demand jumped with all the new TVs, refrigerators, washing machines and
                    computers.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Well, they did, and certainly in terms of trade things like rice imports
                    or beef imports continued to be contentious issues. We'd negotiated with them
                    and opened their system relatively speaking, but in the '90s rice was a very hot
                    issue because the Uruguay Round was going to require concessions. I found that
                    the embassy internal sections' job was shifting. Up till '88, it was very much
                    focused on political reporting and advocacy for democratization and human
                    rights. There were three officers in my internal politics section.</p>
                <p>By '91, the democratization, labor and human rights situation was much improved.
                    The North Korea nuclear issue was a major concern. We only had one officer on
                    the external affairs account who covered that. He was getting swamped by '91, so
                    we moved one of the officers out my section to work with him. I would argue our
                    internal section was becoming “normal.” You'd follow the ins and outs of
                    domestic politics and advocate with politicians and others on key issues like
                    security issues, trade and U.S. policy toward North Korea where U.S. policy was

                    know politicians at all. I, of course, knew plenty of Koreans interested in
                    politics, but it was a dictatorship. In '82, when I first went back in the
                    consular section, through friends, I did meet a number. So my '70s memories are
                    basically newspapers and impressions. Korea's political parties, including the
                    government party, were kept on a tight leash.</p>
                <p>The president of Korea was and still is a very powerful figure. The Korean
                    bureaucracy is very large and powerful too but takes its cues from on high, in
                    part because of all the apparatus that was built to develop Korea. Seoul is also
                    the center of the universe: the capital of government; the center of business,
                    academe and the media.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>The Korean assemblymen of the ruling party, of course, are plugged into the
                    ruling party, and therefore have more power and influence than the minority, but
                    the Assembly as a legislative body reflects what various segments of society are
                    thinking. In terms of the individual politicians as has been true for a long
                    time certainly in the '70s and the '60s, there is a tradition that roots parties
                    in regions of the country. If you come from the Cholla's, then you are going to
                    be in one party, and if you are from the North or South Kyongsung in another.
                    The roots are not just politicaPresidents Park, Chun and Roh were from the
                    Kyongsung area, but social too. There are historic prejudices at work too. A
                    Korean acquaintance's girl friend was forced to break up with him, when her
                    family found out he was from a different region.</p>
                <p>Koreans are smart and very competitive. When democratization came, while the
                    regional biases remained key to electoral behavior, political candidates in
                    Seoul had to work hard to win because the populace came from all over the
                    country. In the 1990s, a new generation also came of voting age, and in the 21st
                    century the Internet opened the system further. But you could see in 1990 that
                    it was a New Korea, economically, politically and in terms of society.</p>
                <p>We shouldn't leave my job in Seoul without noting that a major part of my job was
                    to watch developments as Korea approached its '92 presidential election. All the
                    candidates were civilian politicians. We were worried that conservative
                    hard-liners might try to carry out their threats to disrupt the process, because
                    Kim Young Sam, a long-time opposition leader, had merged his party with
                    President Roh's party, and was the united party's candidate. Since Kim Jong Pil,
                    who led another regional group, also joined the ruling party, the demographics
                    assured YS would win, and he did, so there was an orderly, democratic transition
                    to a completely civilian-led government, quite an accomplishment when you look
                    at struggles in other countries around the world. Another remarkable feature was
                    the lack of revenge taking against the KCIA or police operatives or even those
                    involved in the 1980 coup, accept for eventual trials of Chun and Roh. People
                    wanted to move on and beyond the past.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the role of women by that time, 1990, when you
                        got out there? When I was there in the late '70s we benefited greatly by the
                        fact that the embassy would hire married women because married women even
                        graduates of Ewe and other major fine universities couldn't get jobs. What
                        was happening by 1990?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Let's make one point that even in '69, when I went there in Peace Corps
                    the issue is sort of an issue between college educated or middle and upper class
                    women and working class women. In 1969 when you went into Dongdaemon market,
                    many of the stalls were run by women; food stores run by women, those kinds of
                    things. We often forget...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were married so that....</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>KLOTH: Certainly among all groups in society, the pattern was that a woman, and
                    males for that matter too, should get married in their early twenties, and their
                    parents would find them a spouse. In fact, the parent's job or one of the jobs
                    was to find them a spouse.</p>
                <p>That had a long tradition and up through mid-twentieth century, the bride and
                    groom might see each other for the first time at the wedding ceremony. But Korea
                    in the sixties was changing. Young women after college would often go and work.
                    I think middle and upper class parentat least some parentthought it was a good
                    idea. The young women would accumulate some money and would learn about the
                    world outside the house, even if the vision was to quit as soon as they married.
                    The primo jobs were in the big companies such as Hyundai. One of my students
                    said to me that her parents felt that the experience would help her be a better
                    mother. Their hope was that her socomments like this were invariably about being
                    a better mother for raising boys, not girls - would go to work for Hyundai or
                    one of these other big companies. His mom would know what it took because she'd
                    worked there. Mom's job to run the house and see to it that the kids studied
                    hard and got the education they needed. Koreans' view was that stay-at-home Mom
                    was a full time job and a very important one.</p>
                <p>There was a lot of tension too with parents because on the other hand, there was
                    recognition that people were going to meet people of the opposite sex where they
                    work, so that's another reason for daughters going to good companies. They would
                    meet a bright young man at a good company and make a match. Nevertheless,
                    parents on both sides still expected a veto, and “meetings” with a group, not
                    individual dates, was considered the preferred venue for young people to get to
                    know each other. I remember my grandmother telling me that Indian parents
                    thought American parents criminally negligent in letting two young people who
                    knew little of the world decide to marry each other. Korean parents felt the
                    same way. Marriage was to big a decision to be left to the fancies of youth.</p>
                <p>Well, by the 1990s, things, and this is a kind of a moving scenario and some
                    families moved faster than others, things were changing. Many young women wanted
                    to go on and do more. There were also new opportunities, even in government,
                    including the foreign ministry, and a few women politicians. But I think
                    probably more significant, again I don't know the statistics, but I suspect more
                    significant was an increase of small business opportunities, of small shops,
                    dress shops, for women to be independent even after marriage.</p>
                <p>We should also note that more Koreans were studying abroad and then returning to
                    work in Korea. It began to change in the '70s, first because university jobs in
                    the States became tougher to get, so Koreans finishing PhDs a hard time finding
                    jobs in the U.S. And at the same time Korea had developed and also had a
                    government policy of incentives, things like building apartment houses for the
                    Korean Development Institute, so that when people came back, they could look to
                    a more comfortable life. By the '80s, the U-turners were increasing and even
                    more by the '90s. So that was a significant change, which reflected the new
                    opportunities in Korea.</p>

                        on some issues? And the roll of think tanks of the universities; was there a
                        distinct chattering class? And also although you weren't dealing with
                        external matters but you were dealing with internal, was there a change in
                        attitude internally toward North Korea and Japan, China maybe, the Soviet
                        Union just disappeared or was disappearing.</hi>

                <p>KLOTH: Right, Korea was establishing relations, diplomatic relations with China
                    and Russia.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: On China and Russia, not a few Koreans seemed to believe that Korea's
                    better relations with those countries would upset the United States. Usually
                    that idea came from the many folks with a zero-sum approach to international
                    relations. I spent more than a little time trying to explain to people in all
                    the political parties that the U.S. had long urged such better relations.</p>
                <p>The first sign I saw of the growing influence of the U.S. Korean-American
                    community was among some of our visiting Congressmen from areas with significant
                    numbers of constituents from that community. I remember one Congressman who, in
                    addition to a very busy round of official calls I had arranged as his control
                    officer, had a separate schedule arranged by some influential Korean-Americans
                    in his district. He was completely exhausted by the time he left. It was a bit
                    of a scramble for me too, trying to ensure the too schedules meshed, because I
                    only learned of the second program when he arrived at the airport.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back to 1990s Korean politics, was the U.S. over confident
                        in its trade policies and pressure on Korea to open its markets? Wouldn't
                        that feed perfectly natural but latent anti-Americanism? I mean after all
                        we'd been in Korea for over 50 years sort of throwing our weight around,
                        there had to be a very strong residue or remnant or whatever you want to say
                        of anti-Americanism?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>KLOTH: Well, it's always been there, and it's about Koreans having control of
                    their own fate at one level. There are various different levels to it. Korea was
                    colonized by the Japanese. That was particularly galling to them not only
                    because of the brutality of the colonization, but also because they had been an
                    independent country with their own king, and they traditionally looked down on
                    the Japanese. Koreans felt they were closer to China, which was kind of the
                    center of the universe, and at times in history Koreans even felt they were
                    protecting “real” Chinese culture as, for example, during the Manchu period.
                    (The Manchus had conquered China.) It was doubly galling and frustrating for
                    Koreans to find themselves colonized by Japanese, people they looked down
                    on.</p>
                <p>Depending on the U.S. military and aid after the Korean War made Koreans grateful
                    but also resentful. For many, Korea was not yet fully independent yet. These
                    feelings were there in the late '60s when I first went to Korea, but with a
                    controlled media and political system, the Korean government only allowed
                    criticism of U.S. policy when it wanted to. The opening of the political system
                    after 1988 meant that Koreans could publicly express feelings that they had in
                    the past but couldn't discuss openly in the media. So for some Americans I think
                    this was very shocking and a radical change. But I think for most of us who'd
                    lived as Peace Corps volunteers outside the walled embassy and military
                    compounds, it was no surprise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Korea from 1990 until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: I went to Pusan after three years in Seoul in 1993. Actually, I'd asked to
                    extend a year in Seoul. The dilemma, as you may know, for LDP positions in
                    Korea...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: LDP, Language Designated Positions, is you have somebody
                        waiting in line.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: The issue is for hard languages, the replacements are assigned three years
                    in advance. That meant when I arrived in Seoul, my job was on the bid list for
                    filling within months of my arriving at post. I had to decide right away whether
                    to extend or have somebody assigned and the position filled. So when I got to
                    Seoul, I talked to my new boss about extending for a fourth year because my wife
                    had located a job she liked. Since we had just started working together, my boss
                    not unreasonably said, “Let's wait until the bidding season starts.”</p>
                <p>As things turned out, he came to me not long after and asked if I'd like to go to
                    run the consulate in Pusan instead of staying in Seoul. My wife and I decided
                    that would be fun; I'd never lived outside of Seoul and neither had she. But
                    because I would have been already three years in Korea, I asked if I could just
                    go for two instead of the usual three, lest I hurt by future promotion prospects
                    by spending too much time in one country. Everyone thought that would be
                    fine.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>So in 1993, I headed south for our consulate in Pusan as principal officer. You
                    may recall at that time budget cuts were really hitting the Foreign Service, a
                    periodic occurrence that seems to happen at least once a decade. One consequence
                    although I'm not sure what year or years it happened in the '90s was that State
                    didn't hire any new Foreign Service officers, a short sighted policy we are
                    still paying for. The budget cuts were hitting hard constituent posts hard too,
                    in '92 or early '93; inspectors had come through to look at the embassy as well
                    as at Pusan. When they characterized it as only “very desirable,” my reading of
                    that was the post was in danger of closure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the rationale for having a post there? When I was
                        there in the late-'70s Pusan had a USIA post and Kevin was the USIA officer
                        but there was no...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Well, we had USIA posts in Taegu, Pusan and Kwangju. In 1980 there was not
                    only the most famous anti-government action in Kwangju, but also in '79 and '80,
                    large demonstrations in Pusan and southeast Korea as well. So after the Kwangju
                    rising, the Department decided to augment the USIA officer in southeast Korea
                    with a State officer who would report on what was happening outside the capital
                    because USIS officers “didn't do reporting,” a silly policy if ever there was
                    one.</p>
                <p>At first it was, I've forgotten what they called it, it wasn't an American
                    presence post, a term they use today, but there was some other euphemism. Then
                    after a State officer had been there a couple of years, he recommended they
                    upgrade it to a consulate because at that time the Japanese and the Taiwan
                    governments had representatives in Pusan. The South Korea government was not
                    recognized by Beijing, so they had neither an ambassador nor any other
                    representatives in Korea from Beijing. So it was in something like '84 or maybe
                    '85, when Pusan became a consulate. It had a principal officer and one consular
                    officer, and was to be a listening post outside the capital. With
                    democratization, that function was less important, and, when I went down there,
                    I felt, and was told, that the post needed to justify its existence by shifting
                    to more representational and commercial work, along the lines of consulates in
                    Japan and other developed countries.</p>
                <p>I should also note that Pusan did consular work: visas for Koreans, passports for
                    Americans and other assistance for Americans. The most Americans in the district
                    were military connected, but there was a small business and educator
                    community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you characterize the Pusan area or was this a
                        particularly interesting post? Was there a reason for Pusan other than being
                        a port?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>KLOTH: It is a large port, the largest in Korea, and the district included both
                    Kyongsung provinces and Taegu, a major city. You had a large part of Korea's new
                    industry there. Over in Pohang was the steel mill; Ulsan was where Hyundai had
                    their shipyard and their auto plant. In Changwon there were various hi-tech and
                    the new aviation parts industries. Masan had what they called an export zone
                    where Korean manufacturers could bring in raw materials duty free or with a
                    minimum of customs hassles, manufacture with them and export finished goods. It
                    was an important farming region as well and so a good location in terms of
                    business as well as politics and other activities that were going on. The
                    alternative probably would have been Kwangju, but it didn't have the transport,
                    commercial or U.S. military activities that Pusan did as Korea's major port.</p>
                <p>Before I went down in '93, the DCM told me that he thought the post should either
                    expand or shrink but wasn't sure which. Grow with more staff because there was a
                    lot of visa business and potential commercial work down there. Or shrink which
                    meant it would be cut to one officeI had a vice consul to process visas.</p>
                <p>At that time, Pusan was processing visas for Koreans. With only one vice consul,
                    it was all based on review of documents. Applications were brought in by travel
                    agents. If somebody needed an interview, we sent them up to Seoul. The embassy
                    itself was processing a large number of visas by having travel agents bring them
                    in too; these were short-term visitor tourist or business visas. The prosperity
                    in Korea as well as the increase in the Korean-American population in the U.S.
                    had combined over the course of the '80s to greatly increase the number of
                    Korean's who wanted to visit the U.S., and they needed visas. Since the embassy
                    was unable to expand the size of its consular section commensurately, they
                    reached tilt with ever longer lines outside the embassy, which had a very
                    detrimental effect on the view most Koreans had of our embassy.</p>
                <p>After all, as they say so often in the consular course, the only contact most
                    Koreans will ever have with anybody from the embassy is with the person who is
                    behind the visa window. So the embassy decided in the late 1980s to have the
                    travel agents bring in the tourist visa applications. They would be processed
                    through the computer watch-list system, of course, and then an officer would
                    review them and decide who needed to be interviewed and who could be issued a
                    visa immediately. That was the same system we used in Japan before the visa
                    waiver program.</p>
                <p>Now this was pre-9/11, of course, so the issue of terrorism was not at the top of
                    peoples' minds, and certainly not when it came to Koreans. Visa processing in
                    Pusan was very popular. People who didn't need an interview got their visas
                    faster. We knew the area, so we were able to give added value to adjudication
                    compared to an officer in Seoul. Occasionally, Seoul would ask us to double
                    check on somebody or on a firm.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>At any rate, the inspectors rejected that system. They felt that it undermined
                    the integrity of the visa processing. So unfortunately for me, one of the
                    consequences of stopping the system was that Pusan no longer did visas, except
                    for local Korean officials or other special cases, and they pulled my consular
                    officer out to reinforce the visa line in Seoul; so when my vice consul
                    transferred out after a year, Pusan went to a one-man post. A few years later it
                    was closed, although I understand there is now an “American-interest” post
                    operating.</p>
                <p>The consequence in terms of the view of the consulate and the U.S. in the
                    district was immediate. At every speech and every reception after the end of
                    visa services was announced, the lead question was, “Why are you doing this?
                    Don't you know what a hassle it is to go to Seoul? Don't you want Korean
                    businessmen to do business in the U.S.? Don't you want people to see their
                    families? I thought Korea and Koreans were important to America?”</p>
                <p>I did have a bit of success in trying to ease the blow. When we knew this was
                    coming, I immediately went to the mayor and the head of the chamber of commerce
                    and the head of the travel agent group, and told them what we were going to do.
                    I personally went to the presidents of the local newspapers as well, explaining
                    to everyone that it was a budgetary issue, which it was. I think I was able to
                    ease the impact in terms of my relationships with local leaders. For the average
                    Korean, however, it was seen as yet another sign of U.S. disregard for a staunch
                    friend. Worse yet, the Chinese, Japanese and Russians all issued visas in Pusan,
                    so the compare-and-contrast was unflattering. I can only imagine what Koreans
                    thought when we closed completely.</p>
                <p>I don't mean to belittle the budget issues involved. They went beyond the cost of
                    stationing two or three officers. We shared a building USIS, an old Japanese
                    bank building, built in the '20s. We knew major repairs were going to be
                    required. While in Pusan, I was instructed to look around and see what other
                    options there were. Finding a situation that would meet our security needs was
                    the big problem. One local office building's management were interested, until
                    they thought it through and realized it meant having riot police stationed
                    around the building 24-7, standard practice at the embassy as well as consulate
                    because of concerns about dissident or student-types rushing us. In the
                    mid-eighties, the USIS in Seoul was captured and occupied as was the Pusan
                    consulate. Space was going to be expensive for our Pusan operation.</p>
                <p>Shortly after I got to Pusan, the DCM called from Seoul and told me to fire half
                    of my staff because of the budget cuts. It was the worst job I ever had to do in
                    the Foreign Service. Fortunately, I had one American position that was vacant,
                    so I called back the vacancy notice. I got permission to keep one person on a
                    personal service contract until we stopped processing visas. I did have to let
                    one Foreign Service National (FSN) go. Deciding which one was tough because they
                    were all good.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>We continued U.S. citizen services such as passports, notarials and those sorts
                    of things. I was determined to not let my representational and other duties be
                    tied to the passport window, so we only opened the window for services half a
                    day a week. That turned out too be fine. We could have done that a long time
                    ago, and let the vice consul get out more to do political, commercial or
                    representational work. I should also note that we would also go periodically to
                    Taegu to do citizen services.</p>
                <p>Expanding commercial work turned out to be a challenge. The fundamental issue was
                    that Korea's large firms and many medium-sized as well had their headquarters in
                    Seoul and so worked directly with FCS, the U.S. Foreign Commercial Service, if
                    they needed assistance. FCS agreed with me that a full-time, trained FCS Korean
                    staffer in Pusan could help U.S. exporters by developing local relationships
                    with local medium-sized firms, but never got the funding. I didn't have the
                    staff to really do the time-consuming work we needed.</p>
                <p>The one thing I could do on the cheap was to set up an “American Business
                    Center.” The mayor came over to put up the sign on the consulate wall with me.
                    FCS in Seoul sent me commercial almanacs of American firms and other promotional
                    materials. We put some posters up in our waiting room. We did some training with
                    one of my consular employees, so she could answer questions. Since it was our
                    waiting room already for passports and other consular services it was all set up
                    in terms of security for admitting people from the outside. It was a little hard
                    to know what the pay off was. We did get some newspaper stories and had a steady
                    stream of medium and small business people. It helped to show that amidst the
                    trade friction, the U.S. government was working to promote U.S. exports.</p>
                <p>I also spent a lot of time preparing for possible noncombatant evacuation
                    operations (NEO) with my U.S. military colleagues. Up until the early 1990s when
                    things got tense because of North Korea's nuclear program, the embassy and U.S.
                    military command had not do much coordination on possible NEOs. The ex-pat
                    community outside the embassy and military was also modest in size.</p>
                <p>The military did have NEO briefings and periodic exercises for its dependents. I
                    remember attending such a briefing when I was in Peace Corps. But the military
                    was first of all very focused on their own personnel of which there were
                    significant numbers. I don't know what the numbers were in 1969, but at that
                    time my guess is military dependents may well have been the largest number of
                    Americans and foreigners in country. By the '90s things had changed with a lot
                    more American business people as well as English teachers working for various
                    universities or private institutes; so it was a considerably larger number.
                    There were also a large number of Japanese and others too.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>With increased concern about heightened tensions with the North, our embassy and
                    military began proactive cooperation. The surprise for my military colleagues
                    was that I could not “order” ex-pat Americans to do anything from participating
                    in exercises to evacuating if situation got bad. I could “advise” people through
                    my warden's list, and did go out to some of the communities of U.S. business
                    people working outside of Pusan and Taegu to discuss the process. This issue was
                    a big deal for our little consulate and military bases in the consular district,
                    because if anything happened to Kimpo airport in Seoul, evacuees would be put on
                    trains south to Pusan. And, of course, our military in the south was going to
                    have its hands full doing its primary mission, moving people and materiel into
                    the Peninsula off ships in Pusan and getting them north.</p>
                <p>A big challenge in preparing and exercising NEO plans was to keep a very low
                    profile. The embassy didn't want the North or South Koreans to imagine we were
                    preparing to evacuate American civilians and then attack the North. At the same
                    time Washington wanted to keep maximum pressure on the North and “not take
                    options off the table.” In our district we didn't want to panic Americans either
                    but did need to keep them informed. We also had to manage expectations among
                    this group toour military wasn't going to have the resources to send helicopters
                    out to pick up every American living in some small town.</p>
                <p>My military colleagues from officers to enlisted were great. We spent a lot of
                    time together developing plans from NEOs to base events.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At this time and we've talked about this before, had
                        anything thing gone ratcheting up North-South wise?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Again, because of the heightened tension over the North Korea nuclear
                    program and the attempt to get the North Koreans into negotiations into an
                    agreement, which did eventually come to fruition, tensions had gone higher.
                    There was a great difference between the average Koreans view of the importance
                    of the issue and the view of the American government. Koreans did not want to a
                    war. Many of all political stripes worried that the United States would do
                    something that would start a war. Underlying folk's attitudes was the
                    long-standing frustration that a foreign governmenthe U.S. would pursue a policy
                    for its own reasons that put Korea at greater risk than Americans who lived out
                    of North Korea's reach on the other side of the Pacific. And, of course, South
                    Koreans felt they should be the prime negotiators with the North. Conservatives
                    and liberals differed on what terms should be were united in the opinion that
                    Americans didn't know how to deal with North Koreans. “You just don't understand
                    those guys the way we do. Drive a rat into a corner, and it will bite you.”</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>On the other hand, the same person who might be worried about an escalation to
                    military action might later in a conversation insist that to negotiate with the
                    North Koreans, you had to be tough or they would push you around. The common
                    underlying theme was really the same, South Koreans should be dealing with the
                    North, and the U.S. should let the ROK government run the show.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a pretty good idea of industrial production
                        and how the Koreans were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Well, the Korean factories were booming. This was the early nineties, and
                    they were much more diversified, churning out TVs and other electronic goodies,
                    even airplane parts for Boeing. When I got there first in '69, they were
                    “exporting” construction workers to places like Saudi Arabia. They were
                    exporting cloth and some clothing. By '72, they were exporting a lot more
                    clothing; by '75 even more clothing. By 1993, they were exporting automobiles
                    and electronics from highly modern factories that had just been built.</p>
                <p>From Pusan I would go out and visit plants such as the LG factory in Kumi near
                    Taegu where the TVs were put together untouched by human hands because they had
                    the latest equipment. I went over and saw the Pohang Steel Mill. I'd visited
                    steel mills in Japan in the mid-'80s and even to my untrained eye this Pohang
                    plant in '94 was certainly among the world's most modern. The people who were
                    running it clearly knew their business well; it was impressive. Koreans'
                    enthusiasm for education for the future was evident too. Pohang Steel built what
                    its manager proudly called “Korea's MIT,” Pohang Science and Technology
                    University. That was an impressive place. They were working hard to get very
                    sharp students there.</p>
                <p>The Koreans were also developing an up-to-date defense industry as well. Changwon
                    was one place they were doing it, and they were also building a plant out to the
                    west of Changwon to assemble F-16 fighters. I visited Lockheed-Martin folks out
                    there who I used to visit to see the plant and to check with them on U.S.
                    citizen services issues. The first time I went out the floor was an empty.
                    Before I left Korea, the first jets were rolled out. Making parts in Korea as
                    well as doing the assembly was an important aspect of what was a carefully
                    thought out program of industrial development.</p>
                <p>Let me talk a bit more about U.S. outreach programs in the direct. After I left
                    Pusan, the USIS posts in Pusan and Taegu were closed, although in the new Korea,
                    now in the Internet age, the old USIS regional posts focus on a library and
                    English programs was anachronistic. Koreans could see the NY Times on line;
                    access to uncensored news was not the issue it had been under the dictators.
                    Koreans could afford to and did hire native speaker English teachers in large
                    numbers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about that system?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>KLOTH: Well, I always thought having USIA distinct from State Department was
                    artificial. The distinction between consulate and USIA was something that was
                    lost on most Koreans; certainly the Koreans saw the USIA as the U.S. government.
                    USIA had some very good officers. I felt sorry, thinking back to my time in the
                    embassy's political section, that we didn't have cables reporting from our USIA
                    posts. Their people learned a lot; they were out and about and talking to a lot
                    of people, and often had a very good sense of what was on people's mind, but it
                    didn't get in the cable stream in the way it should have.</p>
                <p>I think my final point is that we need to label our posts outside capitals as
                    consulates or better yet consul generals. A major point is to show the local
                    folks we think highly of them. In Pusan and Fukuoka the other foreign
                    representatives were consuls general; the American was a “consul,” although we
                    were the ally and major trading partner. If an important part of the role of our
                    regional post is to emphasize the importance that we attach to our relationship
                    with a country, we don't serve ourselves well by having representatives of
                    lesser title than those of other governments. I think all these “virtual” or
                    “American-presence” labels are dreadful if we use then in cities where there are
                    diplomats from elsewhere with consular titles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much of an American alumnae association? Koreans
                        who have gone and we are now entering an era where Koreans are going to the
                        United States studying and all and then coming back weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Right. In the '80s, we began to see a U-turn up to the '60s and '70s. I
                    don't know the numbers but...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It just wasn't a factor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Out of every ten that would go, I suppose perhaps seven or eight would
                    stay; by the '80s that was turning around because of the opportunities in Korea.
                    I think by now it's even more so, although we clearly continued to have
                    significant Korean migration to the U.S. There has certainly been a leap in
                    Korean sightseers. I remember talking to a cab driver in Pusan who had been to
                    European a couple of times with some of his friends on tours. He hoped he could
                    send his kids maybe to summer school abroad to learn a language. He hoped to get
                    to the U.S. too, but said matter of factly, “I'm a cab driver, you know how hard
                    it is to get a U.S. visa. I can go to Europe a lot easier.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you picking up, was this a different world, a
                        different outlook in Seoul or not?</hi>

                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>KLOTH: Yes and no. The national TV was clearly the major source of news and
                    programs, so I think in that sense no. But in Korea, as in Japan with Tokyo,
                    Seoul is the center of the universe; it is the center of government, business,
                    education and society. As in Japan, I would go to a lot of receptions with
                    business people and government people in Pusan. It often seemed that a third of
                    the crowd had just got back from Seoul, and a third were going tomorrow. They
                    had to spend a lot of time there to work the bureaucracy, either their company's
                    bureaucracy or the government bureaucracy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, they had a pretty good train going up there didn't
                        they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: They called it the Saemaul high-speed train. It took four to four and a
                    half hours, and it was very comfortable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about fleet visits?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Well, because of the North Korea and the tension with North Korea, I had
                    three carrier visits by two carriers, the Kitty Hawk and the Constellation, over
                    only a three or four month period. In terms of the consulate's representational
                    work and showing Koreans we valued them as allies, it was great to have a
                    two-star admiral host a reception for local government, military and business
                    people. I was actively involved. We had an army base in Pusan and a small U.S.
                    Navy base in Chinhae and a great USO, and they took care of logistics that a
                    consulate would help with in an area without such bases. Local officials and
                    police as well as ordinary citizens were great. Everyone wanted to make sure the
                    visits went well, and they did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How important were the business leaders of the shipyards
                        and steel works and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Well, again their line of sight was back to Seoul because that's where the
                    company headquarters are. The steel mill, shipyards, and auto plants were some
                    distance from Pusan. The Pohang and Hyundai managers were clearly powerful and
                    important people in their area, but they weren't necessarily local. In Pusan, in
                    addition to the people who worked for the out-of-town major companies, there
                    were also businessmen who had significant local businesses, some of them small
                    or medium sized manufacturers, who were influential local leaders. These people
                    were, as in an American city, important people with roots in the community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On universities, one, were there universities there and
                        what happened in the springtime? Did they come out and demonstrate?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>KLOTH: When I was there, demonstrations were not significant at the universities.
                    We would, however, in the fall and spring have a few demonstrations, including
                    near the consulate. We had a few riot police around the consulate 24-7, but when
                    a “demo” was expected, even if it involved just a few people, the riot police
                    would come out in force. They were well informed about what was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were these demonstrations against the United States and
                        for what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: The protests were about U.S. policies — U.S. role in the division of
                    Korea, U.S. troops in Korea, the Hialeah U.S. Army Base being in the middle of
                    Pusan or some issue of the moment. There were some dissident groups who wanted
                    the consulate to move because it was a symbol of the U.S.-Korean unfair
                    “relationship”. Moving Camp Hialeah and associated facilities in Pusan was not
                    just a dissident issue. They sat on prime real estate in that port city
                    surrounded by mountains. Quite naturally moving the base was very much on the
                    minds of the business community as well. From their point of view we're
                    underutilizing potential commercial and residential real estate.</p>
                <p>The U.S. military officers I worked with were very sharp and understood very
                    well. The official position was that if the Korean government would build an
                    alternate facility suitable to the mission we'd move. Most of even the
                    dissidents, I discussed this with, believed we meant what we said. The problem
                    for even a business leader in a place like Pusan is that decisions on Korea's
                    budget would be made in Seoul and moving bases around the capital would be
                    higher priority. Kim Young Sam came in as President. He was from the area, so
                    Pusan people hoped he might do something, but nothing happened.</p>
                <p>We had one big shipping incident when I was in Pusan that made American President
                    Line (APL) very appreciative of our having a consulate there. An APL ship was
                    hit entering the harbor in the fog by a Korean ship departing, nearly sinking
                    the President Monroe. The captain told me that he was ready to abandon ship,
                    “You know, I have so few crew on this big container ship that I can't respond to
                    emergencies the way we could when we had smaller ships and larger crews. I came
                    close to abandoning ship.”</p>
                <p>Fortunately, the captain was able to get it into the harbor and get it alongside
                    a pier. The next excitement started when workers were cutting jammed containers
                    loose to unload them. The contents of one caught fire and set others alight.</p>
                <p>I got a call at 7:30 on a sunny May Saturday morning from the Office of the Under
                    Secretary for Economic Affairs who had just been called by the president of APL,
                    asking for help from our military in Korea. I went down to my Navy colleague's
                    house and knocked on her door. As luck would have it, there were two Navy ships
                    with special fire-fighting capabilities in port, an oiler and a guided missile
                    cruiser. Both ships' crews had special fire-fighting training and equipment.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>Like characters in a movie, we picked up the Navy officers, packed into my car
                    and raced off to the commercial pier. The Navy crews arrived quickly and,
                    working with the Korean firemen, quelled the fires.</p>
                <p>My head FSN, a very sharp guy, was already at the APL office and worked with the
                    local APL people and harbor officials. It was quite an experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was your wife able to find a job in Pusan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: No, she didn't, but she continued to teach up at a university in Seoul and
                    commuted back and forth on the Saemaul train. Jobs for spouses was a real issue
                    if they didn't want to be English teachers. We were lucky.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go next?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: I left Pusan in 1995, and came back to work in the old Political-Military
                    bureau, which was smaller than it is now but had wider compass; this was before
                    the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency merged moved into the Department. I
                    joined the office that did missile, chemical and biological weapons
                    nonproliferation as head of the chemical and biological weapons issues
                    section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did that from '95 to'97. What was sort of the chemical
                        situation in '95-'96?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Well, most of our work was with allies and international groups of states
                    trying to limit the ability of governments or terrorists to acquire chemical and
                    biological weapons. Stopping acquisition of weapons has challenges but the
                    really tough issue was to identify and prevent transfer of equipment a country
                    could use to make chemical or biological weapons. My section chaired an
                    intergovernmental group that reviewed applications for export of equipment,
                    which might be used for that purpose. This is tough because much of this same
                    equipment can be used for perfectly legitimate purposes. It requires review by
                    people who know what the issues are. The challenge is to do it in a manner that
                    provides a good solid review but that also is expeditious manner so that
                    legitimate sales are not held up. We also worked with other countries to
                    identify proliferation-related exports from their firms as well. Here a big
                    issue is being able to provide persuasive evidence without undermining sensitive
                    intelligence collection. Another office in PM reviewed items clearly identified
                    as U.S. defense exports.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, sticking to your perspective where were the trouble
                        spots?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>KLOTH: This work was classified, so I'd prefer to highlight a couple of process
                    issues that perhaps give a taste of the work an office in State does.</p>
                <p>We spent a lot of time working with other agencies, including the intelligence
                    community, on Congressional reports required by legislation. The frustration was
                    they we had requirements in different legislation for reports that were
                    redundant, a waste of time. We were editors because the information and
                    arguments came from the intelligence community, we were proactive editors. We
                    had to be sure conclusions were solid.</p>
                <p>The problem seemed to be that there was no central clearing house on the Hill.
                    Congress would throw reporting requirements into one piece of legislation for
                    one purpose, and then add a similar but slightly different requirement into
                    another at a later time. Undoubtedly, the drafters were trying to address issues
                    of significance to the Congress, but the impression at our end was that no one
                    was checking for redundancy or thinking about the cost to the taxpayer of
                    churning out multiple different reports on the same topic. Nonproliferation
                    wasn't the only area this was an issue.</p>
                <p>When I left in 1997 and later when I was in the Economic Bureau, there was talk
                    in the legislative office of undertaking a Department wide effort to create a
                    master list of all these reports, identifying redundancies and asking Congress
                    to establish a cost-effective reporting schedule. But in the end, as I recall,
                    the decision was that it was going to be too onerous to go off and do that
                    because of the various legislative as well as committee prerogatives that were
                    involved. But that was one area of some frustration that we had in terms of
                    staff time being taken up with tasks of limited utility.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the most exciting biggest job was right at the end of my time in PM, and
                    involved obtaining the advice and consent of the Senate for the Chemical Weapons
                    Treaty, negotiated by the first Bush administration but not been sent up to the
                    Hill before Bush lost the '92 election. Ratification wasn't a top Clinton
                    administration priority until '97, when enough other nations had ratified the
                    treaty and it was about to come into force without the U.S., depriving our
                    government of a seat at the table when others set up the new treaty
                    organization. Suddenly ratification became a top Administration priority. The
                    NSC took the lead with Senator Helms, Chairman of the Foreign Relations
                    Committee and treaty opponent, to get the treaty through committee and to the
                    Senate floor, where there were enough votes to pass it. The Chairman, however,
                    extracted three major concessions. USIS and the Arms Control and Disarmament
                    Agency, which he saw as an anachronism in the post-Soviet world, were to become
                    part of State. USAID's head would report to the Secretary. State, our office in
                    particular, also had to scramble to get out some last minute notifications to
                    other states that the Senator required.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On PM, had that office become staffed pretty heavily with
                        civil servants?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>KLOTH: PM had, I don't know what the numbers were, but certainly PM had a good
                    hefty chunk of civil servants because you needed people who had the historical
                    memory, as well as the technical understanding of, for example, the Chemical
                    Weapons Treaty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you needed people who had really in-depth knowledge of
                        the weapons and as you say the bureaucracy and the negotiations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Right, FSOs provide a broader perspective on how issues fit into overall
                    policy in a country or a region or globally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '97 you are off to...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: To Tokyo. I took a job as deputy in the environment, science and
                    technology (EST) section from 1997-2000. I like to say it was going from bad
                    science to good science, meaning from the use of science to create very nasty
                    weapons to the use of science to advance the human condition in happier ways. I
                    was also coordinator for the U.S.-Japan Common Agenda, an effort to increase and
                    highlight for our two publics cooperation on a wide variety of issues from
                    development to the environment to international crime. We had six officers and a
                    very good Office Management Specialist; a minister counselor was the head of
                    section. We also had what we called the “science cluster,” which included a
                    National Science Foundation office, an Department of Energy officer and the
                    USAID representative. USAID was in our cluster is because our section and I, in
                    particular, was the coordinator in the embassy for the U.S.-Japan Common Agenda.
                    When an unexpected year long gap in the USAID position, I filled in. The EST
                    section also had three top-notch FSNs. NSF and USAID also had excellent Japanese
                    staff in addition to the American officers.</p>
                <p>The Common Agenda started in 1993 was an initiative by the Japanese, and the
                    thought was that there are three pillars to the relationship: security, trade
                    and cooperation on many global issues. Security and trade issues usually got the
                    headlines, meaning negative headlines, so the Japanese government wanted to
                    highlight positive cooperation through the “Common Agenda” name plate. They also
                    wanted to see both governments get more bang for the buck or yen through
                    increased coordination. We agreed.</p>

                <p>KLOTH: Right and, in particular, the Common Agenda covered a wide range of
                    important but little appreciated areas from cooperation on development to
                    scientific and technological research and the Kyoto process. You remember the
                    Kyoto Conference on Climate Change was in the late fall of '97.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: I arrived in August, so we were in the final run up to the Kyoto
                    Conference.</p>

                <p>KLOTH: I arrived in August of 1997, and we were in the final run up to the Kyoto
                    Conference on climate change. We had a very sharp officer who had been there a
                    year already working on Kyoto and knew it very, very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: A guy by the name of Allen Yu. Unfortunately, Allen had to take emergency
                    leave, I took over for the last major pre-Kyoto Conference meeting.
                    Undersecretary Wirth, former Senator Tim Wirth, led a U.S. delegation out. There
                    was a lot of contention between us and the Europeans as to the level at which
                    the goals, the targets, should be set. Another huge issue was that the Chinese,
                    Indians, Brazilians, and others in the developing world didn't want to have
                    targets levied on them at all, lest such obligations slow their development. Of
                    course, the underdeveloped countries argued that the greenhouse gas problem was
                    literally manufactured in the developed world and that, as developing countries
                    they couldn't afford all the expensive technology to, for instance, clean up
                    emissions from coal plants. Indeed they needed to get as many coal fired plants
                    up and running to provide the electricity they needed for development at the
                    lowest possible immediate cost.</p>
                <p>Between the United States and the Europeans, there was disagreement about the
                    levels of emissions targets that should be accepted by the developed countries.
                    It was my first experience at a UN conference. The U.S. delegation was in
                    constant communication before they came out with both American businesses and
                    American environmental NGOs; listening to both sides very carefully and trying
                    to craft a position that would enable us to cut down our emissions without
                    adversely affecting our economy.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>In Europe the political mix meant their governments seemed more concerned with
                    cutting emissions. As I looked at this getting ready for the preparatory meeting
                    and the Kyoto Conference, in both the press and the reporting from our posts in
                    Europe, we didn't seem to hear much from the European business side or the
                    economists who were concerned about the impact on business. It was also my first
                    experience seeing the dance between representatives of both individual European
                    states and the EU. There were times, I think, when the American delegation and
                    other national delegations found this a little frustrating because both the EU
                    and individual states wanted to talk and courted. Fortunately, Allen was back
                    for Kyoto, where we certainly needed his expertise. The huge U.S. delegation
                    included executive branch officials from many agencies as well as members of
                    Congress. Representatives from U.S. business and environmental NGOs attend too.
                    The Vice President zoomed in for the finale. Kyoto was an enormous undertaking
                    logistically for an embassy. We mobilized administrative, political and economic
                    section officers, and even our defense attach� mobilized before we were
                    done.</p>
                <p>My boss and I did a tag team, because the conference was, as I recall, 7-9 days.
                    My boss went down at the beginning and the end, and I was there in the middle to
                    give whatever additional help was needed. When I first arrived on maybe the
                    third or fourth day, all the delegations were very, very busy, but were in
                    pretty good humor. By the end, however, people were tired; jet lag hit like a
                    club - they had flown in from all over the world. Most importantly, the issues
                    were narrowing down along predictable lines, and it was not clear how a
                    compromise was going to be reached. The tension level among the Japanese
                    delegation, who as hosts wanted a success most of all, had gone well above the
                    roof. This was a tremendous big deal for them, and the idea that the conference
                    could somehow end without a Kyoto agreement was for them taken very
                    personally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you know as this thing reached its end, how did you
                        personally and your colleagues and also to the American delegation view this
                        thing? The Kyoto thing is still, well, it hasn't been ratified, meaning that
                        it still is a bone of contention, but how did you view it as it was coming
                        to an agreement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Everyone on the U.S. delegation was working hard, but many were frustrated
                    because of an underlying sense that no matter what agreement came out, it was
                    not going to be ratified on the Hill. The U.S. would sign on but would not get
                    the legislative support that it needed. As we went running up to it, Under
                    Secretary Wirth, who had come to the preparatory meeting in Tokyo resigned as
                    the Under Secretary for Global Affairs, and took a job with Ted Turner's new UN
                    organization. While U/S Wirth insisted he was driven by the opportunity, many
                    and certainly many Japanese officials felt it was an ominous omen for the Kyoto
                    process. The Japanese first question to us was: does this mean he thinks this
                    agreement is not going to happen, that this conference will be unsuccessful, and
                    he doesn't want to be associated with it?</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It strikes me that this wasn't very gracious on the part
                        of Wirth.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: From where I sat in Tokyo and then Kyoto, the timing wasn't helpful. But,
                    as you well know, we diplomats spend a lot of time holding other people's
                    hands.</p>
                <p>The U.S. delegation, including the senators and representatives who came out,
                    worked hard. The acting under secretary, who was the assistant secretary, not
                    only had to work with the foreign delegations, but met every day with the
                    environmental groups and the U.S. business groups, separately, of course. She
                    would brief them on what was happening and then take their comments and
                    suggestions. Often what one liked, the other hated, although not always. The new
                    world of multi-constituent diplomacy is a challenge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find an awful lot of you might call “ideology” or
                        very firm ideas on this? I mean the business delegation said, “What are you
                        trying to do ruin us?” The scientific people were saying, “You are going to
                        ruin the world if you don't do something.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: I think the question for the business people was what are the costs
                    involved and what's the impact those costs are going to have on American
                    businesses competitiveness, particularly vis a vis firms in countries such as
                    China or India that do not take on environmental obligations. The
                    representatives from NGOs were vociferous in demands for tough targets.</p>
                <p>Let me add to that we also had on the U.S. delegation a delegate from the
                    Pentagon, I believe a Navy officer. Our armed forces operate globally ships,
                    airplanes and other vehicles. The services were very concerned about the impact
                    of an agreement on their operations and costs. I would not say they were
                    negative. They understood the need for a green environment, after all the
                    sailors and the airmen are in the air and on the seas. The issue was costs and a
                    key part of that was whether there would be a global standard or individual
                    national standards; the latter could be a nightmare for our military
                    operations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Japanese? I mean the Japanese are a big
                        business power obviously.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: The Japanese government had clearly committed itself to an agreement.
                    Japanese had, after a number of awful incidents, cleaned up a lot of their own
                    industry. There was concern among Japanese business about the potential cost and
                    the impact on competitiveness. Japanese are very sensitive about how the world
                    sees them. Japan was hosting the conference, so most Japanese wanted success.
                    Nevertheless, Japanese business was calculating the costs for different options
                    carefully.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mercury.</hi>

                <p>KLOTH: Mercury pollution too, that was one of the big ones.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Minamata? I went to a U.S.-Japan-China-Korea waste disposal conference
                    there hosted by the University of Montana's Mansfield Center. Minamata is an out
                    of the way place. It had a museum with the history of the problem with mercury
                    poisoning. I saw horrific photos of what had happened to those poor people. So
                    the Japanese were very conscious those problems. I think by the fall of '97,
                    many Japanese businessmen were as concerned as the broader public that this
                    Kyoto process be successful. I suppose that, given the politics in Japan as
                    host, opponents of an agreement were not likely to be as publicly vocal as say
                    some of the American business people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also, were the Japanese looking towards the new world as
                        regards anti-pollution manufacturing devices and things of this nature?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Japanese industry is very sharp at seeing which way the wind is blowing
                    and sailing with it, not against it. Think back to the first oil shock in '73. I
                    was out in Seattle, a graduate student. One joke that went around was that when
                    Congress proposed gas mileage consumption limits, U.S. auto maker hired
                    lobbyists. The Japanese hired engineers. I'm not sure that's really changed
                    three decades later.</p>
                <p>To finish off Kyoto, the Conference was at deadlock when it was time for me to
                    get on the bullet train back to Tokyo. My boss and I sat down in the coffee shop
                    at the Kyoto railroad station. I briefed him on what was going on. Vice
                    President Gore then made a dramatic arrival and broke the deadlock, putting
                    forward U.S. agreement on a standard, so consensus was reached except, although
                    China and the developing countries remained outside. Congress never
                    ratified.</p>
                <p>The discouraging part after such high theater were the reports afterwards that
                    the Administration knew Congress wouldn't support what was put on the table and,
                    therefore, was not going to push it forward on the Hill. While the Japanese were
                    delighted the Vice President had made “their” Kyoto conference a success, for
                    the next two and a half years, we were frequently asked by Japanese in and out
                    of government, why the U.S. hadn't ratified yet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you explain this to the Japanese, your
                        counterpart?</hi>

                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>KLOTH: The Japanese watch U.S. politics a lot more closely than we watch Japanese
                    politics. Japanese officials understood, although they were very frustrated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, after the Kyoto Conference what were you up
                        to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Okay, well then my focus was on the Common Agenda, as embassy coordinator,
                    and on oceans-related science issues. We would have Common Agenda meetings once
                    a year at the Under Secretary level home and away. We had them twice in Tokyo
                    and once in Washington when I was there.</p>
                <p>At high level meetings, the top officials always want new initiatives every year,
                    but there is not necessarily money for new initiatives. Worse yet for us State
                    Department worker bees, State had no money of its own for projects. Other
                    agencies funded. USAID was perhaps the biggest gorilla in the room on the work
                    with our Japanese counterparts. Nevertheless, AID didn't have new funds for new
                    projects every year, so there was always a scramble before the meetings to come
                    up with “significant new initiatives” that could be taken that wouldn't involve
                    new monies. Of course, our Japanese foreign ministry colleagues did not have new
                    monies every year either, so we were partners in pain. Working with Japanese and
                    American NGOs on projects that were funded was fun, however.</p>
                <p>Another factor was that Japanese assistance budgets were coming under increasing
                    pressure from the Diet. The Japanese economy was doing poorly. Diet members were
                    asking why taxpayers' money should be spent on foreigners, not their
                    constituents.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find just in all this type of thing you've got a
                        bunch of people particularly at the top trying to do things when a lot of
                        things that they were doing really required at a certain point you saying,
                        okay we've done that, now let the people who actually manage it do it, and
                        it is going to take a couple years and let's keep our hands off?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: The issue was not that the top wanted to monkey with on-going projects,
                    but that they wanted new initiatives and didn't have the money to pay for new
                    stuff.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>KLOTH: I worked closely with some great people at the National Oceanographic and
                    Atmospheric Agency (NOAA) in my role as oceans attach�. This slot was for many
                    years a separate position in the economic section, filled by a non-State expert
                    from the Fisheries service. The oceans attach� was very important to the U.S.
                    and the Japanese when the United States let foreign fleets come in to the
                    American Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) to catch a set quota of fish. The attach�
                    was the go-between between Washington and the Japanese government on fisheries
                    and, in particular, quota issues. He was also the go-between on highly
                    contentious whaling issues. By the mid-'90s, foreign vessels could not fish our
                    waters, and maritime environmental issues were at the top of the pile, so the
                    position was moved to the EST section and environment and scientific issues were
                    an important part of my portfolio.</p>
                <p>NOAA in the late '90s had a project called the Argos Project which put floats out
                    all over the world's oceans to collect data. While 70 percent of the world's
                    surface is covered by water, we know very little about it in terms of the
                    science of it. This also relates to not only to climate change but daily
                    weather, storm predictions, health of the oceans, fisheries, there is a wide
                    range. Fisheries issues were still in my portfolio. They were chiefly focused on
                    the challenge of trying to protect the resource with large. We did have some
                    fisheries protection treaty negotiations that I was involved in.</p>
                <p>The whale issue was highly contentious. It's a terrific example of a diplomat's
                    worst nightmare. The diplomat's job is to make deals. I'm being a little
                    facetious here. How do you make a deal when one side sees whales as, if not your
                    brothers and sisters, then your cousins, while the others - the Japanese,
                    Norwegians and Icelanders - sees whales as cows and pigs, a food source. Of
                    course, you don't want to kill them all, because then there won't be any left to
                    eat tomorrow. You can agree to manage them wisely, but eating them is no worse
                    than eating a cow or a pig. If whales are your cousins, just eating a few is
                    unacceptable. Where's the space everyone to give a little and get a little?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How important were whales in say the Japanese diet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: By the late '90s, whale meat was a pricey delicacy. The Japanese only did
                    some “scientific” hunting, so supply was limited.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it is just like back in the turn of the last
                        century, chicken was the main meal on Sunday, a book even called Chicken
                        Every Sunday. Chicken was a pretty fancy item; we didn't have the great
                        chicken farms.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>KLOTH: Right, right. After World War II the American occupation government had
                    encouraged the Japanese to whale to supply protein to the diet. But by the late
                    '70s, early and late '80s, the whaling moratorium became for many in Japan a
                    symbol of cultural imperialism on the part of Americans. Americans are chomp
                    away on their burgers and their fried chicken, and badmouth Japanese for wanting
                    to eat whale.</p>
                <p>We also had a NASA representative in our office. Every time NASA does a space
                    launch with foreign crew members, the crew visits the foreign country
                    afterwards, so we had two visits to Japan. The second one was the one in which
                    John Glenn also flew and the Japanese crewmember was a woman, so that got a lot
                    of attention in Tokyo. Everyone in the section usually worked in some way on the
                    visits which were fun and highlighted U.S.-Japan cooperation.</p>
                <p>The NASA representative was a full member of our section. He was a GS-13, I
                    think. NASA management was sharp. Some agencies think having stand-alone offices
                    staffed by their own mid-level or even senior people increases their local
                    clout, perhaps at the specialized ministry but not across the Japanese
                    government. NASA released that our arrangement gave them a solid expert on the
                    ground, plus the services and clout of the EST minister-counselor, a high
                    ranking diplomat, which impressed our Japanese counterparts in the scientific as
                    well as other ministries. Because inter-ministerial communication is often
                    difficult in Japan, the title “career diplomat” can enable you to move
                    horizontally in ways not so simple for what the Japanese bureaucracy see as
                    “detailees” from U.S. functional agencies. The diplomat needs, however, to
                    demonstrate that he or she has the support of the U.S. agency to be
                    effective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah, this is something we often forget about. We think in
                        terms of our own bureaucracy and not...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Not how it looks to the host country officials. Further, the NASA
                    representative working on our section's issues, like high-level visits, gave him
                    experience outside his usual box and a useful perspective on how, say, NASA's
                    work supports and is supported by broader U.S. interests in Japan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, looking at the time you were, there how would you
                        describe the flow of scientific knowledge between the United States and
                        Japan? Was anybody ahead or behind? How was it working?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>KLOTH: First of all, the amount of contact that goes on is far beyond what I had
                    imagined. When our minister counselor and I visited Tsukuba, Japan's science
                    city, andits nuclear research facility, we were startled to be shown around by
                    two American professors from Princeton and Cornell who come over every year with
                    their students to use the facility, one of only a few available in the world.
                    The global demand exceeds the supply, and they were happy to get time on the
                    Japanese machines. So there's a lot that goes on. We don't hear about it in the
                    embassy because they don't have problems.</p>
                <p>Language is a big barrier in terms of foreigners having access to Japanese
                    research data. The Japanese are also very concerned about this being a barrier
                    to their access to foreign research. The science faculties want to make sure
                    that their students can read, write and speak English, so that they can
                    participate actively in the global scientific community. So, for example, at
                    Tokyo University, which is Japan's primo university, the MA students present
                    their MA thesis in English.</p>
                <p>While, as I noted, some Americans went to Japan to do research, I'm sure many
                    more Japanese came and come to work in our facilities. They come over; they do
                    research in U.S. facilities and certainly make contributions. While there was
                    Japanese government money for research, Japanese scientists complained of
                    bureaucratic entanglements. They still looked to the United States as the most
                    hospitable place for researchers.</p>
                <p>For example, Japanese scientists told me that the Japanese government would
                    identify an outstanding scientist or what was felt to be the cutting edge
                    technology or cutting edge research topics, and provide government funds to set
                    up a research institute, often getting very good results from it. But, let's say
                    five years down the road, that would no longer be the cutting edge and the
                    reward, the cost benefit analysis, would've shifted to another area. But the
                    bureaucratic and political system militated against open competition for grants,
                    so that individual or institute would continue to get funding regardless, and at
                    the expense of innovative research by lesser-knowns. Our National Science
                    Foundation folks argued that the U.S. system was much more nimble.</p>
                <p>Before we leave Japan, let me make another point about the Common Agenda. One of
                    the frustrating things with the Common Agenda and one of its goals was to
                    highlight all the good things, good cooperation going on in other areas other
                    than defense and trade. Overall our security alliance had kept the peace in
                    Northeast Asia since 1953. Americans and Japanese were benefiting mightily from
                    trade. Nevertheless, issues such as base locations or incidents of crime by U.S.
                    military members or trade disputes grabbed headlines. It was very difficult to
                    do highlight cooperation because it wasn't bad news.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>I and my Japanese Foreign Ministry colleagues thought a lot about the problem. We
                    could usually get a small paragraph in the press when the meetings took place
                    but it was hard to imagine many people even noticed. In the final meeting of my
                    tour in 2000, we had a breakthrough and got front page coverage in the Tokyo
                    papers of the NOAA Argos oceanographic research float project which Japan
                    joined. The breakthrough came when the powerful Ministry of Transportation (MOT)
                    heard about the project and invited me to come over and brief them. They became
                    very enthusiastic, because Japan is, after all, an island nation dependent on
                    maritime transport. MOT wanted in. There was some hesitancy on the NOAA and
                    Japanese scientists' side, because the transportation ministry is clearly not a
                    science research organization. There was concern that the scientific research
                    part might get deflected or diminished.</p>
                <p>Because I understood NOAA's interests and was in Tokyo and could meet with the
                    Japanese S&amp;T Agency as well as the MOT officials, I was able to get everyone
                    to focus on the advantages to all of working together. A key point was that MOT
                    had a great deal of clout in the Japanese government's budget process. Well,
                    NOAA brought out a model of the float to the 2000 Common Agenda meeting. MOT
                    held a press conference highlighting the project with the float there as a
                    visual aid. Their press corps was very much plugged in to not only the editorial
                    boards of their papers but also the Diet, so we had a front-page newspaper story
                    with an artist's rendition of the float, fully deployed! It was a very good
                    feeling and also very frustrating. When things go well, few much care.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ted, you left in 2000, whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: I came back to work as deputy director in the Economic Policy shop in the
                    East Asia Pacific Bureau. EAP/EP's main job was working on APEC, the Asia
                    Pacific Economic Cooperation economic organization with members from both sides
                    of the Pacific from Russia, China, through Southeast Asia, Australia, New
                    Zealand, around up along the Pacific coast of Latin America to include the U.S.
                    and Canada. It was founded in 1989. They meet every year at the presidential
                    level, preceded by ministerial and a stream of senior official-level sessions.
                    The range of issues covered is very broad, so the office is very busy. I believe
                    there are now 21 countries and on the web today it said something like 40
                    percent of world trade.</p>
                <p>When I was there, we were focused on the leaders' meeting in Vietnam. Each year
                    the host country is different, moving around the rim of the Pacific. The
                    leaders' meeting is the capstone, the heads of economies meeting, and we use
                    that term because Taiwan is also a member, and it's our policy that there is
                    only one China. Taiwan is, however, an economic player that shouldn't be
                    ignored.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>It was exciting because Vietnam was going to host for the first time, and this
                    was going to be a major coming-out party for Vietnam in terms of becoming part
                    of the global economic system. Vietnam saw that very much as key to the future
                    of its economic development and for the relationship between the United States
                    and Vietnam, because the President would go. So this was loaded with
                    significance for our two countries.</p>
                <p>APEC was very plugged in to the world of Internet technology. Emails flew between
                    people working on various projects or areas in all the APEC countries. A
                    footnote here about the struggle to get State to keep up with technology. In
                    2000, the State system didn't allow officers to go from their desktop computers
                    to the Internet. In EP we had a couple of Internet-linked computers in our lobby
                    area. All day we hopped from our office chairs to the Internet computerwhen
                    someone else wasn't using them. If you'd put a TV camera in the ceiling, it
                    would have looked like the Keystone cops. Secretary Powell did a great thing
                    when he got Internet on every desk.</p>
                <p>For the United States, an important goal was to get HIV aids on the APEC table
                    and a commitment from the APEC economies to work together to stop the spread if
                    AIDs and to deal with the problems of people already infected. The initial
                    reaction from many of the economic officials involved in other countries was
                    that AIDs was a health ministers' problem, not an economic problem. One of the
                    best things I ever wrote in the Foreign Service was a one line addition to
                    remarks for our senior official to deliver at a preparatory meeting to build the
                    agenda for the presidential level meetings. We needed to get these bright guys
                    focused on what it meant for them. We needed to speak their language. I came up
                    with a simple thought: Imagine the impact on your economy now and over the next
                    decades, if you have HIV infection rates of 20-40 percent of the workforce. I
                    have to admit that bright idea was one that caught my attention in a moving
                    statement by an African delegate to a Tokyo AIDs conference I attended while an
                    EST officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to say you had the example of African
                        countries which were being devastated and I suppose still are. Of course,
                        tourism for the Asian countries was huge.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Tourism is a huge one. We also pointed out that HIV/AIDs potentially hits
                    everyone in your labor force from managers to factory workers from truck drivers
                    to teachers. So what's the economic impact going to be? Our senior official told
                    us that after he said the first sentence, he had the room's attention. So that
                    was very satisfying.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you faced with the problem, how would you say not
                        just the Asian but we are talking about the whole Pacific Rim. But in Africa
                        you had cases of countries going into denial.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>KLOTH: Exactly, and that was a big issue in Asia because countries were saying
                    that it's not going to happen here. There is a whole stream obviously of social
                    issues and cultural issues and religious issues that this touches on for a
                    politician in these countries, as well as for the general populace, in terms of
                    denial of everything from the size of the sex industry to the lack of sex
                    education or the extent of a gay community. Of course, this disease is not
                    confined to that community but in some areas the notion was: admit HIV was a
                    problem, admit some of your citizens are gay, and that is anathema.</p>
                <p>We had the evidence of the links between economic activity and the spread of HIV
                    aids in the region in countries like China, where you could see it going along
                    the truck routes. Again, these are complex problems, even gathering the
                    statistics to understand the problems' dynamics is difficult, in countries where
                    the health systems are very underdeveloped. Our focus was to increase
                    cooperation from exchange of information on infection rates to ideas on best
                    practices for preventing infection.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was thinking, when you talk about the Pacific there is a
                        tendency for obvious reasons to focus on the Asian side. But you've got
                        Mexico, Chile and other countries on the east side of the Pacific. Were they
                        comfortable playing with their Asian partners?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Well, they'd certainly seen within APEC this big opportunity to interact
                    and network at various levels with countries that had already demonstrated they
                    knew how to develop. You mentioned Mexico, of course, at that time and since I
                    guess the '90s and certainly pushed on by the opportunities created by the
                    U.S.-Mexico FTA...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Free Trade Agreement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Japanese companies, Koreans, other Asian but particularly Japanese set up
                    plants in Mexico. They clearly had economic interaction going on already, and
                    they wanted to multiply the benefits by being in APEC.</p>
                <p>Thinking about U.S. economic foreign policy, APEC added to our multi-dimensional
                    approach. We have three levels. We have bilateral relations; one could think of
                    something like Mexico and the Free Trade agreement as one of the cornerstones of
                    those efforts, but often it's bilateral negotiations to reduce individual
                    barriers. Then we have a regional approach working through organizations like
                    APEC. Then we have the global level, which is the World Trade Organization, the
                    WTO. The goal is to open markets for U.S. goods and services, and we've been
                    pursuing this agenda at various levels for decades. If some things are difficult
                    to move forward on a bilateral level, you may try at a regional level, forcing
                    folks who refuse to move forward to compete with other countries in their region
                    willing to do so. It also gives officials political cover and builds broader
                    support for change. But clearly it's labor-intensive work at high levels.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that you or any of your colleagues or were
                        there any groups that were saying, 'Hey, wait a minute we are giving away
                        the store on all these free'...opening up things because all these other
                        countries aren't going to play the same game or it's really hurting us, the
                        unions, the manufacturing side, one is saying what the hell are we producing
                        outside of service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: As, you know, it was my experience in Korea and Japan that many U.S.
                    companies want to expand their sales to new markets. The companies in the United
                    States and the workers that feel pressured by the foreign imports coming want us
                    to have a protectionist position and either they are under pressure or are
                    afraid they will come under pressure. So you've certainly touched on the
                    political issue in the United States as well as the economic issue. We mustn't
                    forget that the global and domestic economic system is continually changing
                    whether we like it or not. I grew up in New England. Look at the history of that
                    region. The changes have been tremendous over the past two hundred years. Every
                    administration I served under, Republican or Democratic, was determined to keep
                    our markets open and to open foreign markets.</p>
                <p>That said, I think over the past three decades we saw an increased concern in
                    both parties about how to deal with the human consequences. A fifty year old
                    auto worker laid off in Detroit is not going to retrain as a computer engineer
                    or even easily move to Kentucky when a foreign automaker opens a plant
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find was there a different style or approach
                        say on the Chinese part or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: In China, and many other countries with a more aggressive government role
                    in economic planning, the government's legitimacy is often very much rooted in
                    achieving a publicly announced rate of economic growth. China has been astute in
                    letting foreign, including U.S. firms in, on China's terms. With such a large
                    potential market and low labor costs and a literate and ambitious work force,
                    such firms would naturally want to build factories in China, transferring
                    technological and management skills. China's goal is to see Chinese companies
                    become international players. Who should worry us more 21st century Chinese
                    software engineers or 20th century Chinese Red Guards?</p>
                <p>Labor rights were an APEC issue, but the kinds of things that American
                    delegations would say and concerns raised would be raised with not just China
                    but with other member countries where workers were unable to organize freely.
                    Countries such as Mexico wanted to add free flow of blue-collar labor to the
                    discussion of the free flow of capital, goods, services and companies across
                    borders. We were uninterested.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>APEC's big-picture idea was to pick out the issues that could be moved forward as
                    a whole and get consensus to do so. With so many different levels of economic
                    development as well as often complicated bilateral relationships, it's not
                    surprising that getting something done took so much effort, but amazing that
                    anything got done at all.</p>
                <p>I would also like to comment too on another aspect that made working in EP
                    “different.” The EP office was staffed by an interesting collage of Foreign and
                    Civil Service State employees, Presidential Management Fellows, and people on
                    loan from other agencies. The mid-1990s hiring freeze at State had left gaps
                    that the office director had to scramble to find bodies to fill. It was fun to
                    work with such a crazy quilt group.</p>
                <p>Another peculiarity of that office was that when these higher level meetings took
                    place, the office virtually emptied out because we needed to provide staff at
                    the overseas locations. Our embassies could not handle the substantive side with
                    so many special topics and take care of the heavy logistical requirements too.
                    Often I and the Office Management Specialists (OMS) were the only ones left in
                    the office. I wound up acting office director, Senior Official (DAS-level) and
                    action officer on all our portfolios.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ted, then in 2001 where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: In 2001, I moved to the Bureau for Economic and Business Affairs (EB) and
                    its Office of Economic Policy and Public Diplomacy. This office had two sides. I
                    was the deputy on the policy side, and we had a deputy for public diplomacy.
                    This was the result of the merging of USIA, U.S. Information Agency, into the
                    State Department in the 1990s. Nominally, our office director reported to the
                    Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary, whose portfolio was trade. But, in fact,
                    we wound up the assistant secretary's personal staff, in part because our job
                    was to look out over all the economic issues EB handled and give him a heads up
                    on issues or ideas were coming down the road or that people were not paying
                    sufficient attention to because they were struggling to keep their noses above
                    water with day-to-day demands.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>We also did a lot of practical things. We were the Department's coordinator for
                    the G-8 meetings, which were in many ways like the APEC meetings, with frequent
                    high-level meetings culminating in a Presidential summit. It was tremendously
                    labor intensive.We also coordinated the BPP, the Bureau Performance Plan, for
                    the assistant secretary. This effort was a labor-intensive effort too, because
                    while EB didn't have any embassies, we covered global economic issues. Frankly,
                    too, while the assistant secretary took it very seriously - he had to defend it
                    in a meeting with the Deputy Secretarno one else was as focused. We were
                    unlikely to get any new positions, even if the BPP showed we were understaffed,
                    as we were in some offices. State people outside of administration or consular
                    affairs never, in my experience, see much utility in planning. We don't usually
                    have any money for programs, and political or economic situations or
                    negotiations change in ways that make year or even six-month plans of any detail
                    seem superfluous.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you sense a feeling of when the Republican
                        administration came in hostility to that, which had gone before or not or in
                        any particular area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Certainly, the new Bush Administration wanted to show it was a “big
                    improvement” over the policies of the Clinton Administration, just as the
                    Clinton folks wanted to “set the country back on the right track” after Bush I.
                    I was in the East Asia Pacific bureau at the transition. Jim Kelly who came in
                    as the new Assistant Secretary for East Asia Pacific, knew the Department well.
                    He had been a Naval officer and worked in the National Security Council, so he
                    had an appreciation for the State Department and the people in it. Colin
                    Powell's arrival as secretary was tremendously positive because he reached out
                    and showed he cared about people as well as policy. Certainly we were on our
                    toes because of the concerns of the Republicans about the fiscal as well as
                    policy sides of the Department's operations.</p>
                <p>I'd certainly say that Deputy Secretary Armitage too had everybody on their toes
                    partly because of his personal style. He had been an assistant secretary at
                    Defense, so knew State and Foreign Service officers' roles well. Everyone was
                    anxious to shine for the new management but comfortable that they knew the
                    Department. There wasn't the layer of mistrust that comes with people without
                    experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was talk today we are in the second day of the new
                        Obama administration. So God knows what's going on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: There is always a certain tension until you get to know the new boss in
                    any job - that tension is always there. But with new Republican Administrations
                    it tends to be more severe because the Republicans as a group are more concerned
                    about government, the size of government and the people working it, feeling
                    they're not in tune with the philosophy of open markets and smaller government.
                    They may well be right.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were in the EB policy shop from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: I was there from 2001 to 2003. I had only been there a couple of months
                    when we were hit on 9/11. EB went into war mode with the war in Afghanistan, and
                    the clear mandate for our assistant secretary was to develop the international
                    economic support and intellectual framewora plan — for Afghanistan's
                    post-Taliban economic development. A special team was set up in EB to work with
                    all the other agencies to do that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the war in Afghanistan hit you all in what you
                        were up to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: In our shop some of our folks became part of the new team. I continued
                    going around to economic seminars around town. I realized there was growing
                    concern in the U.S. development community, international NGOs as well as among
                    governments in the third world that U.S. aid for Afghanistan meant less
                    assistance for others. The web is terrific for research. I could sample NGO,
                    government and media websites all over the world. Pre-Internet I would probably
                    have sent out a blizzard of cables seeking information, but I could web-surf
                    around the globe from my desk. I wrote a paper alerting the assistant secretary
                    of the need to address that concern. I don't know exactly where that fit into
                    the thinking, but the Administration developed the Millennium Challenge Account,
                    not only more money but also a new approach to get countries involved in needed
                    reforms to qualify for more aid and ensure the aid had bigger impact.</p>
                <p>In the run up to the assault on Iraq, EB put together an interagency group to
                    prepare an economic plan to deal with post-Saddam Iraq. Our office was involved
                    with supporting that effort too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But also was this part of a process? The State Department
                        went through a great deal of planning for a post Saddam thing which was
                        completely dismissed, I mean, I'm not sure if the term is right, but it
                        seems to be right, by the Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and his
                        courtiers and Vice President Cheney which frankly lead to I'm not sure the
                        State Department plan was the plan but certainly the thing was a disaster
                        and it was a disaster because of poor planning.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Right. Our section was not involved as a unit, so I don't have an
                    insider's knowledge of what happened or didn't happen in prior planning. EB
                    certainly put good people on the issues. We certainly know now that our top
                    national leadership ignored advice they didn't want to hear from a wide variety
                    of people, apparently including the Secretary of State. Once the war started,
                    EB, like everyone else, worked hard for success.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To just touch on this as we are leading up to your
                        involvement in Iraq personally as a Foreign Service officer looking at this,
                        and I realize this, sort of on the personal side how did you and maybe some
                        of your colleagues feel about the connection between Iraq and the terrorism
                        attack?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: I had plenty to do and wasn't pouring over the intel on that issue, so
                    could only note the debate in the media and wonder about the Administration
                    argument on the Al-Qaeda connection. On WMD, I thought that Saddam had or was
                    trying to get nukes, chemical and bio weapons. I had people from my PM office
                    who had gone to Iraq with the UN teams in the 1990s. They had seen his programs
                    and the lengths he had gone to conceal them. Remember we only caught up with his
                    bio-weapon program because his son-in-law defected. I will confess I did not
                    question what I thought was the intel communities' evaluation that Saddam had
                    weapons of mass destruction.</p>
                <p>I could see the President was in an awful position. If weapons of mass
                    destruction from Iraq were used in the U.S. or in Europe, then how would the
                    president justify inaction. That said, I thought invading Iraq ill advised. I
                    think Secretary Powell told the President that you break it, you bought it. I
                    thought he could have continued: breaking it is a hell of a lot easier than
                    fixing it. I couldn't imagine the American public would accept a steady stream
                    of casualties for long either. I have always been leery of U.S. boots on he
                    ground in as volatile area as the Middle East.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went from this policy area to where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Then I went up to the Hill for a year to work as a Pearson Fellow.</p>
                <p>Before we leave the policy office, I'd like to discuss my work with U.S. consumer
                    groups. U.S. consumer groups felt that they had insufficient voice in U.S.
                    foreign economic policy, although the European Bureau set up a U.S.-European
                    consumer dialogue to parallel a U.S.-European business dialogue. The role of
                    U.S. consumer groups, like that of other NGOs, will continue to grow in
                    international policy, I think. The issue for consumer groups is that they have
                    no easy place to plug in at State or most other agencies. EB's focus is business
                    issues. A fundamental problem for our leadership was, as with all NGOs, who do
                    they represent? How do you know how much weight to give the views of this
                    organization or that, or even coalitions we helped but together such as the
                    groups involved in the US-EU Consumer Dialogue?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know the role of NGOs, consumer groups, and all. It's
                        always...</hi>

                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>KLOTH: Consumer groups tend, understandably, to be focused on domestic agencies
                    and the domestic political process. In the 1990s, they began to understand the
                    impact of international economic policy on their issues. But they seem to have
                    been slower in reaching out to State in the way business and unions had been for
                    many decades. Basically we operate on the doctor theory. If you are sick, you
                    call me. If I don't hear from you, I assume you're OK. Businesses call quick
                    when they have a problem in a foreign country, so do human rights or environment
                    NGOs.</p>

                <p>KLOTH: That is from 2003 to 2004. I worked as foreign policy advisor to New
                    Hampshire Senator John Sununu, member of the Foreign Relations Committee and
                    chair of its Foreign Operations Subcommittee. I'd gone to college in NH, and my
                    mother lived there since I was in high school, so I knew something of the state
                    which is why I think he signed me on. The Pearson program folks at State had
                    urged me to find a slot with a Republican. A number of Democratic Senators took
                    Pearson fellows year after year. I think their chiefs of staff saw the benefit
                    and reached out to State's legislative office to keep them coming, but we didn't
                    have much representation on the Republican side. I know Sununu's office brought
                    on successor FSOs after I was there. But Sununu lost his seat in 2008.</p>
                <p>Sununu was first elected in 2002, so I was the foreign policy guy in the office.
                    I set up hearings for the Subcommittee and followed a host of issues, including
                    Homeland Security issues because I had a security clearance others didn't.
                    Sununu was the only Senator of Arab-American heritage, so I was exposed to the
                    Middle East as never before. It was a great experience. We really should get
                    more FSOs up there. A Senate staffer and former FSO once told me that FSOs know
                    more about foreign legislatures than their own!</p>
                <p>I was then Director of EB's Transportation Policy Office from 2004-2006. We
                    handled air security, safety, environment problems, and maritime commercial and
                    security issues, working closely with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
                    and States' counterterrorism office. The issues were sensitive, so I'd prefer
                    not to go into detail. The challenge was to develop internationally acceptable
                    systems to deal with these problems, in the context of U.S. legislation which
                    often required that our agencies act in ways that other countries considered
                    intrusive. Our job was getting everyone focused on outcomes and developing
                    mutually advantageous plans. DHS' biggest problem was juggling U.S. legislative
                    requirements against foreign countries' own politics, laws and regulations</p>
                <p>Following that, I volunteered to go to Iraq. I thought our invasion ill advised,
                    but we had to find solutions to the mess.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>I arrived in Baghdad in the summer of July 2006. I was deputy in the economic
                    section. When I arrived, we were swapping out everybody at the end of their
                    one-year tours. Continuity was an issue. I had been attending Iraq related
                    meetings in the Department since January when I got the assignment which
                    helped.</p>
                <p>We had no FSNs to provide perspective either. It took me almost a year to hire an
                    FSN in Baghdad because of the difficulty of background checks and finding
                    someone willing to work for us. If found out, FSNs got killed. I found a
                    terrific person in the end.</p>
                <p>At any rate, I arrived in early July which gave me a few days overlap with my
                    predecessor and over a month overlap with the out-going Minister Counselor,
                    whose successor's schedule meant he arrived in August. That was important, and I
                    got a pretty good idea of what the section had been doing and needed to do.</p>
                <p>Not long after my arrival, the military command started a major effort to secure
                    Baghdad. In many guerrilla wars, the guerrillas own the mountains and rural
                    areas. In Iraq, the key struggle was for control of Baghdad. The fight in Anbar
                    province was important too, but if a government cannot control its capital, it
                    has had it. The effort in mid-2006 failed in Baghdad. The idea was to clear and
                    hold a limited number of areas and then expand. The bad guys simply kept going
                    in the rest of the city and then figured out how to get back into the areas we
                    had “cleared.”</p>
                <p>A major part of my job was the section's principal liaison, meaning the one who
                    went to a lot of meetings, with the military. I managed the day-in, day-out side
                    of the section too, liaison with the Iraqi parliament, where I really missed not
                    having the language, and personnel, plus, of course, backing up my very busy
                    boss when he had to be two places at once. The Iraq leave package and out of
                    town or country meetings meant that I was acting chief of section for almost
                    three months, including for the critical time in December 2006, when the
                    economic policy to support the surge was decided with the Iraqis. In the
                    economic section our focus was on policy and the legal framework in Iraq. The
                    Iraq Reconstruction and Management Office (IRMO) and USAID had the program
                    money.</p>
                <p>A key U.S. political and economic goal was to get the Iraqi government to pass a
                    new Oil Law. My boss and our energy section - and the ambassador and DCM - spent
                    a lot of time with top Iraqi, including and Kurdish, officials trying to hammer
                    out a mutually acceptable new Oil Law. I also was involved in meetings on this
                    subject in my boss' absence. The law was very contentious because of the
                    politics between Baghdad and the Kurds in particular, although, given the
                    importance of oil revenues to Iraq's economy, there were a lot of other players
                    too. Our section also worked closely with the Iraqis to put together the
                    International Compact with Iraq in which the Iraqi government and the donor
                    nations agreed to economic reform in Iraq.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>The economic section did not run projects per se. AID and IRMO, the Iraq
                    Reconstruction and Management Organization, had the project funds. In general,
                    people worked closely together. With emails and phone calls and digital video
                    conferences at levels right up to the President and Prime Minister communication
                    within the embassy and to Washington as well as with our military was
                    continuous. Now and again I certainly wished we still had the old cable system
                    that slowed things down. I remember at one point the Front Office told us to
                    stop responding to email requests from DC because we were so busy. If you get a
                    cable, we respond. If you get an email, send it to the FO staff, and it's on
                    their head that you ignored it.</p>
                <p>We got along pretty well with our military colleagues. The chief issue seemed to
                    be that some had difficulty understanding, even in the States - look at our
                    Katrina relief efforts - still not done, political processes move at their own
                    pace. As far as economic issues went the fundamental issue was that you weren't
                    going to have the kind of economic growth and development Iraq and Iraqis needed
                    without securitend of story. Compared to a lot of countries such as Afghanistan,
                    Iraq had a lot of advantages: capital from oil, although that was a curse too,
                    since some Iraqis' vision of the future was just living off oil revenues. Iraq
                    had human capital, in spite of a high illiteracy rate through the Diaspora
                    community throughout the Gulf, Europe and the U.S. with many people highly
                    educated and well versed in modern business. While the number of Iraqis who fled
                    the violence was not small, I was always impressed by how many stayed. But who
                    was going to invest very much in even a small shop, if you might be blown up or
                    kidnapped for money or shot. All of us wished that change could come faster.
                    Americans and Iraqis were getting killed. But I certainly cannot think of any
                    country that has developed new and effective political and economic institutions
                    overnight.</p>
                <p>What is often lost sight of is that the so-called surge of 2007 was not
                    successful because we simply brought in more U.S. troops, but because we had the
                    right strategy. U.S. and Iraqi troops moved into Baghdad and set up camp, so
                    they could protect people, their homes, schools and businesses. “Civilian”
                    economic and political programs are fine but without security, they fail.
                    Further, if there is security, locals start working to build their own
                    businesses and political process. Assistance programs are a plus, but the local
                    folks are the key.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>The ambassador certainly and the country team worked very closely with the
                    command. Ambassador Khalilzad and General Casey were making key decisions in
                    2006. The ambassador worked very hard on the political side trying to get the
                    Sunni and Shia, and the various factions within those two groups, to work with
                    each other in the central government. We also had provincial reconstruction
                    teams, which I believe had started about April, 2006. A couple of friends of
                    mine popped up as provincial reconstruction team leaders, and they would come
                    into Baghdad periodically and gave me a chance to get some outside the capital
                    insights. It was very difficult to move not for us outside of the Green Zone but
                    for these PRTs to get out to “their” areas - to move outside of their particular
                    compounds because of security. But I tried to expand my range of vision by
                    talking with as many people, including the few FSNs in various other sections,
                    as I could and with PRT folks from outside. I also met myself with
                    parliamentarians and ministry officials. Was it the preferred way to do things,
                    of course not. Was it better than not being in country at all? Certainly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were PRTs supposed to be doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Well, the PRTs were to be in a sense the embassies' representatives in the
                    provinces. They were to work with the provincial governments and with the
                    embassy to help the Iraqi government build working relationships. That meant
                    relationships that worked between the central government and the provincial
                    governments. The provincial governments were being given new responsibilities
                    they never under Saddam's top down, centrally controlled system. For example,
                    the ministries had branch offices in the provinces. The line of chain of command
                    was from the provincial department of education office to the central
                    government's Ministry of Education. It was not through the provincial government
                    as such under Saddam. The new system gave provincial governments authority,
                    resources and responsibilities they never had before.</p>
                <p>The PRTs were to try and help the Iraqis develop democratic political
                    institutions and processes and new relationships with the central government.
                    Budget issues were key. Everything from how do you set up a provincial budget to
                    what documents do you need to send to the Finance Ministry to get funds released
                    when you need them. Lack of security meant driving to Baghdad to do some
                    networking might get you killed. That was a serious problem and made it hard to
                    build new personal relationships or simply talk over a proposal for a new
                    bridge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously the “surge” action on our part and with the
                        Iraqi troops was a key breakthrough in strategy, but was this also
                        instigating it or was there movement...at a certain point guerilla stuff
                        doesn't work or this sort of thing when the populace says screw this. Had
                        they reached the screwing point or something?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>KLOTH: Anbar Province was dominated by Sunnis who now found themselves out of
                    power with a Shia dominated central government. Democracy meant that would
                    continue, because Shias have a demographic majority in Iraq. Even in Sunni
                    areas, boycotting the elections left Sunnis with governments skewed against them
                    or against majority groups. Anbar was a hotbed for Al-Qaeda and for Sunni
                    resistance to th new government and to U.S. forces. Things began to change in
                    the fall of 2006 because the mid-level sheiks decided that the Al Qaeda
                    operators in Anbar were not working in the Sunnis' best interest. Sunnis also
                    realized that boycotting the earlier elections had been a mistake and that the
                    Baghdad Shia-majority government wasn't going to go away in spite of the car
                    bombs.</p>
                <p>If I could pause too, I talked about the military preparations for the surge. So
                    what is the embassy doing and what was the civilian role in all of this? In the
                    summer when I arrived, there were a number of goals that had been identified on
                    the civilian side, overall it was to encourage and push the Iraqi's to start
                    operating as political actors with each other in a democratic manner. But the
                    Iraqi body politic had a lot of internal tensions.</p>
                <p>There was deep animosity among many toward those who supported the Baath Party,
                    people who worked for Saddam in the old government. There was tension between
                    Sunni and Shia and within those groups. There was resentment against returnees
                    by people who stayed and suffered under Saddam, including many in the
                    bureaucracy who felt they had done their jobs to make things better rather than
                    “just run away.” And now the exiles came back and became ministers. For many
                    Iraqis and Iraqi bureaucrats, that didn't seem right. This happens in many
                    countries when a country is liberated or, if a colony, becomes independent.
                    Returnees and many others think that those who were in government jobs were
                    helping keep Saddam and his thugs in power by making the lights go on or the
                    schools run.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I watched this in Germany in the early '50s.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Exactly. By '06, there was a lot of resentment toward Americans too. We
                    were still trying to tell Iraqis how to run their country, apparently oblivious
                    to the mess “the U.S. had created,” as one Iraqi put it to me. By '06, of
                    course, “the Americans” had been running Iraq as far as most Iraqis were
                    concerned for three years. The water didn't work; they couldn't go outside their
                    house without taking their life in their hands; there was little electricity,
                    and here we were still lecturing them on how to do things right.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>I remember one American, a retired FSO who had been an ambassador, who entered
                    right after the invasion, said when he arrived at a ministry, four of the
                    director generals greeted him with a plan for revamping the ministry. He left
                    soon after, but returned as part of our “civilian surge.” After doing his
                    introductory rounds, he told a group of us that he was struck most to discover
                    that three years before, Iraqis were full of ideas for change, but now the
                    people he had just met seemed so passive. “What happened here? What happened to
                    that enthusiasm? I was told to come out and give the Iraqis a push to do this
                    and that. Well, the Iraqi's didn't need to be pushed when I talked in three
                    years ago but now I see this passivity? What have we done to them?”</p>
                <p>Well, that's a good question without a simple answer, I'm sure. By '06 Iraqis had
                    to be wondering how long is this present government going to last? How long are
                    these Americans going to be here? It was clear by my arrival that there was a
                    time limit, and it would be shorter rather than longer. What's coming next?
                    Another thought in peoples' minds was: these Americans are always telling me how
                    smart they are. Fine, let them do it. I'll do what I'm told to do, but I'm not
                    coming forward with anything new. Finally, if you're a responsible Iraqi
                    official and good custodian of Iraq's money and you know Americans will pay for
                    something if you sit on your hands, what's the right thing for you to do? Let
                    them do it and pay for it, of course.</p>
                <p>I think we underestimate these kinds of political and psychological and economic
                    disincentives that we create in all our hurry to “get results now.” Results in
                    some cases I bet we couldn't get out of our systeand I'm thinking of New Orleans
                    and the Gulf Coast how many years is it since Katrina? Our haste is
                    understandable. Our soldiers are dying, but we often seem to be short of
                    humility and realism.</p>
                <p>So much more than once I heard first or second hand comments not just from former
                    Iraqi government people but from Iraqi businessmen, educators, others: Why don't
                    you just let us do this? We know how to rebuild a country; we did it after the
                    Iran-Iraq war. So that was very frustrating. The basic problem was that the
                    Iraqi political, social and economic dynamics were going to work themselves out
                    one way or another but on their own timeline. The surge established the
                    security, and Iraqis started to work again.</p>
                <p>What was the U.S. civilian component going to do to support the surge. First, we
                    would keep working with the Iraqi government to help them make it work. There
                    were a couple of key political issues such as provincial elections and
                    resolution of the problems of ethnic tensions in Kirkuk. Then there was on the
                    economic side they need for a revised oil law, as much a political symbol as a
                    needed reform to encourage foreign oil firms to invest. That's something that
                    our section worked on very hard. We created new provincial reconstruction teams
                    and imbedded them with our military units to provide our military colleagues
                    with people who had expertise in things like politics, economics, reconstruction
                    and assistance.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>The White House wanted the Iraqi government to put spend its money in a surge of
                    civilian projects, new housing, that sort of thing. The Iraqis, had a quarter of
                    their budget marked for investment in capital projects, about $10 billion. They
                    pledged to get those projects going. The Iraqis told us that long-term projects
                    would give Iraqis the confidence and the resources they needed to get things
                    moving. One official said: short-term projects get short term results, not
                    lasting results.</p>
                <p>We did throw in some extra funding, as I recall, from U.S. government programs,
                    and did reorient some of the U.S. government programs to be more directly
                    available for things that the PRTs on the ground could identify as an immediate
                    need. But the bottom line was that if this new military strategy could not bring
                    security, none of the civilian programs - American or Iraqi - would get off the
                    ground.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left in the summer of '07, what did you think?
                        Wither Iraq?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: I thought that finally we had a security plan that was making progress,
                    that intellectually was the right one. In the end we had to keep people safe.
                    The insurgents understand that because the car bombs or roadside bombs or
                    attacks on markets or mosques have one simple message: We can kill you and
                    neither the government nor the Americans can protect you or your children, so
                    we're going to take over.</p>
                <p>I was amazed at how many Iraqis just kept going, in spite of the violence. They
                    maybe walked their kids to school when before the kids went on their own, but
                    then Dad or Mom came to work or opened their shops. But the insurgents were
                    trying to find the tipping point with bombs and guns.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it's the thing I too noticed when I was in Vietnam
                        that we tended to work a six-day week. I mean things had settled down and
                        long hours and holidays. We didn't shut down the consular section we'd have
                        going, but our local employees left first. I thought about this and thought,
                        hell, why are we doing this, and then I realized they'd been doing this war
                        more than twenty years, and we were doing it 18 months at a time, our war
                        was 18 months and their war was twenty years. Of course, they were pacing
                        themselves.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Right, that's their life. When you read about war as long periods of
                    boredom and then seconds of terror, in the end most of my time is get up, eat
                    breakfast, check my emails, whatever it is you do as your regular routine, and
                    it's just schlepping around and then suddenly you hear the thuds of a rocket
                    attack. There were a number of rockets that hit the embassy when I was there, a
                    number close to my office. That wakes you up. Another point in thinking about
                    troop casualties' going up is that to the extent that bad guys under pressure
                    are going to punch back. When our troops are more aggressive, casualties will go
                    up.</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>But day in and day out you don't think about those, you do your job. I guess that
                    was your Vietnam experience. But we had a lot more protection than Iraqis. When
                    I was briefing my new FSN on the duck and cover procedures, I was trying not to
                    be alarming. But my new employee reminded me: “Mr. Kloth, it's all right. Don't
                    forget where I live. I know about these. But I appreciate your telling me what
                    we do inside the embassy.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there and came back. Very briefly what have you
                        been up to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KLOTH: Okay, I retired as an active duty Foreign Service in September '07. The
                    East Asia Pacific bureau asked me if I could come in and fill in a gap they had,
                    because their new Congressional liaison officer wasn't coming from Afghanistan
                    for six months. They brought me back as a WAE, When Actually Employed, a
                    temporary employee. When the new officer arrived, EAP asked me to continue and
                    work with the Coast Guard to implement a maritime environment protection program
                    in the Malacca and Singapore Straits. I reached my pay yearly cap and left in
                    September 2008.</p>
