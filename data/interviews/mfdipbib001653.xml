                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 15th of November, 2007, the Ides of November.
                        This is an interview with Nadia Tongour. This is being done on the behalf of
                        the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training and I am Charles Stuart
                        Kenney.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>And you go by Nadia?</p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Alright. Nadia means hope. No-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: It does. It is the shortened version of the Russian word “Nadezhda.”</p>
                <p>n the first place, when and where were you born?</p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I was born in Istanbul, Turkey, in 1947, and my family and I emigrated
                    to the United States when I was three and a half years old.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let me see. Your family name is Tongour?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: That is right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me, what do you know about the family, the Turkish
                        and the other roots that you know about the family.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: On the father's side, the Tongours came from the Crimean Peninsula. They
                    were ethnically mixed but may have had some Tartar or Central Asian elements in
                    their background.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that is the Tartar Republic then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Yes, but they were not actually Tartar ethnically speaking but the name
                    itself may have originated in Central Asia. And the family, or at least my
                    father's side, somewhat resembled characters out of Chekhov's “Cherry Orchard”.
                    They were not terribly affluent but they had a little bit of land and even an
                    orchard and the grandfather had studied to be a lawyer prior to the Russian
                    Revolution. Once the revolution started, he joined the equivalent of the judge
                    adjutant corps for the White Russian army, led by General Wrangel. Subsequently,
                    in 1920, my grandfather was evacuated with Wrangel's forces, the remaining White
                    Russian troops in Southern Russia, to Istanbul — leaving his wife and my father
                    behind in Crimea. My father was born in 1917 right around the time of the
                    outbreak of the revolution. He and his mother stayed behind for a few years
                    because my grandfather firmly believed the revolution would be short-lived and
                    he himself would quickly return. That obviously didn't happen, and in the early
                    1920s my grandmother and my father managed, albeit with some difficulty, to get
                    out of the country and find their way to Istanbul. where my father grew up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did your father do in Istanbul?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Well, he arrived there as a young boy and remained in Istanbul until he
                    immigrated to the United States. As a youngster in Turkey, he was one of the
                    fortunate people that had the equivalent of a CARE sponsor in America, who would
                    send money and occasional gifts which enabled him to attend a good school.
                    Later, he was drafted into the Turkish army. Before coming to America, ; he
                    briefly worked in an import/export business. During that period he met a
                    gentleman from New York who owned several factories in a textile-related
                    industry, specifically making zippers, in the South and overseas. He often hired
                    capable foreigners to work in his business, and at some point he offered my
                    father a job. This happened apparently around the time I was born, and my father
                    applied for immigration visas for the family. Under the prior immigration
                    system, it took our family approximately three years to obtain the necessary
                    visas and come to America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we leave there, on you mother's side-?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: That is a very interesting story. My parents probably never would have
                    met in the old country as they came from very different backgrounds. My mother's
                    family came from Moscow; they were very assimilated and secular Jews. In fact, I
                    did not even know about that aspect of the family history until much later. My
                    mother's grandfather, had been a doctor, who own a small medical clinic, and in
                    1905 he apparently saved the life of someone who later became prominent in the
                    Russian Revolution. This story is not unlike a segment in Dr. Zhivago. And the
                    reason I mention this is that the world my mother's family inhabited was that of
                    the Muscovite intelligentsia. Her relatives hung out, if you will, with artists,
                    with writers. They knew the Pasternak family. I don't mean to imply that they
                    were bosom buddies but they were in the same social set. And they were friendly
                    with some fairly well-known poets. It turns out that my grandmother, when she
                    was a very young woman, even acted in some silent films. She was a very colorful
                    person, my maternal grandmother, and in some ways her experiences were larger
                    than life. But she ran off quite young from an unhappy home situation and
                    married the first of a number of husbands, each of whom was of a different
                    nationality. Sometime around 1929 or 1930, she met and married a Turkish
                    businessman, with whom she was able to leave the country. My mother was already
                    born (the child of the first marriage) and she was able to accompany them to
                    Turkey. But mother and daughter did not stay there long, moving to France
                    shortly thereafter, where they lived among Russian �migr�s in Paris. It was not
                    exactly a jet set existence, but they did move around Europe somewhat. After a
                    number of years in France, they moved to Romania, where my mother attended a
                    French High School. Eventually, they found themselves back in Turkey just after
                    World War II broke out. Although my mother knew some Turkish , she did not know
                    it well enough to go to college there (having done all her schooling in France
                    and Romania). So after high school, she found a job with an allied military
                    office based in Istanbul (then a hot bed of information gathering in that
                    period) doing some translations and interpreting since she knew several
                    languages including a little English.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, how did your mother and father meet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: In Istanbul. Essentially, my father had grown up in Istanbul, with his
                    family having moved there from Russia in the early 1920s. My mother happened to
                    wind up there during World War II, thanks to her, somewhat peripatetic mother My
                    parents met through friends there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall much of Turkey at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: I have been back subsequently but from my early years, I only remember
                    some fleeting scenes. I knew that I had a Turkish nanny, which we called Hanum.
                    I knew that at the time we left Turkey we spoke French and Russian at home..
                    That was very common since and both my parents had gone to French speaking
                    schools. They also spoke Turkish; but both parents know several other languages
                    as well. For example, growing up in Istanbul, my father, had many Greek friends,
                    so he learned Greek. Similarly, having lived in Romania, my mother she spoke
                    Romanian. But at home they spoke French and Russian plus enough Turkish for me
                    to learn a few words, mostly baby talk.</p>
                <p>Perhaps, a more interesting aspect of our arrival in America was that my parents
                    were under the impression we would go to a small town in the South for eight or
                    so months while my father learned the ropes of this business and be trained an
                    then supposedly we would move to New York City, where he would work for this
                    company, (a zipper business) at its headquarters. But one thing led to another,
                    and my parents are still there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: In Barnwell, South Carolina, which in those days was a very small town.
                    : Until then, neither of my parents had ever spent any time as adults in a small
                    town. When they first arrived by train in Barnwell, it was quite a shock,
                    especially since we came on a Sunday at a time when “blue Laws” were alive and
                    well. In other words, nothing was open, and they really did not know how to make
                    their way. Ultimately, they have done quite well, but it was initially a culture
                    shock. Remember this was the early'50s And they have done quite well but it was
                    quite a culture shock and this was the early '50s, and the McCarthy era was in
                    full flower, and a number of other things were going on. Both the Ku Klux Klan
                    and Jim Crow laws were alive and well. One of the first episodes I recall
                    (though it has actually become family lore) was the visit of the “preachers” as
                    they are known in those parts. As my parents tell it, the Baptist minister was
                    the first to “call”. And my father, not knowing the local mores, offered the
                    minister a drink, an alcoholic drink. And the minister was not amused; he was
                    polite but after he left, I guess he told other people that this foreigner had
                    offered him a drink. Well, shortly thereafter the Episcopalian minister came to
                    call. I think my father had learned a lesson by then and offered the
                    Episcopalian coffee. Anyway, that was our introduction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what religion had your family come out with and
                        where did they end up?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: When my parents married they had, as I mentioned, a very mixed
                    background which could make a book of its own. However, when I was born, they
                    decided to “clean the slate”, so to speak, and baptize me, Greek or Russian
                    Orthodox, which they did in Istanbul. But when they came to South Carolina, to a
                    small town with no Greek or Russian Orthodox Church nearby and with lots of
                    visiting protestant ministers they eventually settled on the Episcopalian
                    Church. That said, both of my parents had attended Catholic schools and allowed
                    me the opportunity to frequent others churches in our town. But in the ninth
                    grade, I went off to a Catholic boarding school for a year before returning to
                    my local high school. But the family stayed with the Episcopal Church.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, let us talk about Barnwell.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Barnwell is a very lovely southern town that was actually somewhat known
                    in the Civil War, or as it was locally known, the War Between the States because
                    Gen. Sherman marched through Barnwell and burned the town. In fact, in E.L.
                    Doctorow's book The March, it is cited and frequently described by the occupying
                    forces as “Barnwell burns well”.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have to state a prejudice. My grandfather, not my
                        great-grandfather, my grandfather was an officer in Sherman's army.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Your grandfather. Well then, he must have visited Barnwell. In the early
                    '50s, Barnwell had some lovely, broad, tree-lined streets, with a few
                    antebellum-style houses, with a population of about 5,000 people. When we
                    arrived there, it was a completely segregated town, with roughly 2,500 whites
                    and 2,500 or so blacks. And everything from the doctors' offices to the water
                    fountains were separate. The town has come a long way over the years, with
                    dramatic changes and is now fully integrated. But, I, going to Barnwell
                    Elementary School and then high school was never in an integrated class because
                    although integration had begun during that period, it was handled in a way that
                    was surprisingly effective or rather did not provoke violence or other problems:
                    namely, they started with the first grade and each year another class was added.
                    Thus, the children who started in an integrated school would continue all the
                    way through. But if you were in the seventh grade when integration began, it did
                    not catch up with you by the time you graduated. That was one notable aspect of
                    small town life in the South in the 50s.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>The other factor, perhaps more relevant for this account, was that we were one of
                    the only two foreign families in town. Given the specifically hostile attitude
                    toward Russia and the generally limited knowledge of the world in that area
                    then, we did not tell anyone that we were of Russian background; in fact, we
                    spoke of coming from Turkey. In retrospect, I am really grateful that we wound
                    up in this small southern town; had we moved to New York I probably would not be
                    sitting here today — speaking to you as a former Foreign Service Officer. First
                    of all, I might not have gone to college or even if I had, I probably would have
                    had a more limited educational experience, because we undoubtedly would have
                    been ensconced in essentially an ethnic ghetto and lived the typical first
                    generation life. Instead, effectively we crammed the experiences of three
                    generations into one . As a result, you had a situation in which both my brother
                    and I managed to go to graduate school, obtain advanced degrees, and have
                    successful careers. As for my parents, while they retain their accents, I would
                    pit my father's knowledge of English vocabulary against that of any
                    well-educated America. This was a benefit of forced assimilation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, let us talk about growing up as a little girl. What
                        was it like? I mean, in the first place, let us talk maybe about the family
                        first. Did the outside world penetrate the family circle or did you sit
                        around and talk about things or was news important, papers, TV?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Right. Very much so, very much so because my family was always
                    interested in the wider world. And certainly for the first several years the
                    family felt very isolated, and we were a little self-contained unit unto
                    ourselves. Given the atmosphere of the times, my parents were concerned that I
                    would become too much a small town girl, and to the extent they could, they
                    exposed me to whatever cultural opportunities might be available. There were
                    certain limitations, both financial and simply the difficulty of getting out and
                    about. Still we did whatever we could and took family trips wherever possible.
                    Then again this was initially quite an adventure because my father did not know
                    how to drive when he came to America and had to learn quickly — with the usual
                    number of mishaps. In sum, there was a great deal of interest in the outside
                    world as well as a real awareness of being different. By the same token there
                    was a real push to become assimilate and become American. We spoke earlier about
                    immigrant families focusing on education, and there was certainly a great deal
                    of emphasis at home on education, on doing well in school. My father had a
                    slogan which he used for years, which was, “whatever you start, finish in
                    beauty.” Overall thought, I would have to say that at least until the ninth
                    grade or so, I definitely felt like an outsider, so to that extent one could say
                    it was somewhat of a difficult transition for me, being the foreigner and
                    feeling odd. Luckily , I had no problems with speaking English or doing well in
                    school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were you much of a reader?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: Voracious. I read constantly. I mean, I have a younger brother who is
                    nine years younger so for the first part of my childhood I was an only child,
                    and books were companions. Another interesting aspect of my childhood was that
                    when I was seven or so, my two grandmothers, who until then had lived in
                    Istanbul, both moved to American to be with us ( my parents were able to sponsor
                    their immigration). And although we had a comfortable house, it was not
                    especially large; yet these two grandmothers for a while both lived with us.
                    Eventually first one and then the other moved to New York, but my father's
                    mother returned to South Carolina in her later years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The grandmother who was the jet setter-? How did she
                        survive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: She did not stay in South Carolina too long. Actually, she had a very
                    interesting life afterward.. I do not want to portray her as a jetsetter because
                    that is a bit misleading, even though she lived in several countries and moved
                    with a somewhat artsy set. When she moved to New York City, she wound up doing
                    some newspaper work, interviewing people for a Russian newspaper and radio show
                    in New York. A few years later the second grandmother moved to New York as well
                    and wound up living with the first. So although these two women did not always,
                    see eye to eye on everything they wound up sharing a home, first with us in
                    South Carolina and then in New York. While she was in New York, my father's
                    mother sewed costumes for theater companies, which made it possible for me to
                    see lots of shows whenever I went to visit. However, after some years she
                    returned to Barnwell to be closer to her family. She never really learned
                    English very well, and it was difficult for her. For example, I remember going
                    downtown with her to the drug store, and she would have a hard time grasping why
                    the clerks could not understand her — while she was speaking in Russian .
                    Essentially, she never fully made the transition to American life, which her
                    family had nearly completed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, there is always that generational thing. Actually,
                        you are fortunate that your parents made the transition because so many
                        parents do not. It is the young kinds, you know, this is sort of the
                        American tragedy, almost, of parents sacrifice everything to take their kids
                        to the country but the do not quite make it but the kids do.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: That is right. Well, in our case, my father basically had to assimilate
                    because he had a factory to run.. What had happened was that while had been sent
                    to South Carolina primarily for training, within a matter of a year one plant
                    manager after another left for various reasons. The “whys” weren't significant
                    for our story but within a short period my father was asked to be plant manager
                    and wound up supervising a large number of people. Although my parents were not
                    highly educated in a formal sense, they were highly motivated. For example, my
                    mother, who had always wanted to go to college, finally in her late 30s was able
                    to do so, starting with a few classes at a nearby branch of the University of
                    South Carolina and subsequently commuting to Columbia, where she received her
                    degree and her Phi Beta Kappa key. She then went on and to obtain a teaching
                    credential in addition to her degree. And my father was completely
                    self-educated, but incredibly knowledgeable on a wide range of subjects. .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, go back to you. As a young kid you say you liked to
                        read. Do you recall and books as a sort of elementary school, ones that
                        particularly encouraged you or interested you in that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Yes. There was a writer, who think she did a wonderful job; her name
                    was, if I recall correctly, Lois Lenski. She wrote all kinds of books for
                    elementary school children, but there was a memorable one in which the father
                    leaves his job for a year and the family travels around America and learns all
                    about the country through meeting people and doing odd jobs. But geography and
                    history were always of great interest to me, plus I read literature of all
                    kinds. There was never any question growing up that I would go to college. I was
                    a good student and there were parental expectations that I would do my best —
                    about that there was never a question.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were you getting much, particularly either Turkish
                        or Russian history from your parents or was this not a major subject?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: We talked about everything, especially the news. Whatever was on the
                    news was a major subject of conversation. Both of my parents were readers; when
                    the grandmothers came to live with us, there was also a great deal of
                    conversation about the old country. But there was also a lot in the news of that
                    period about the Soviet Union. I should point out that my father's family felt
                    (not unlike the sentiments expressed by the Cuban contingent in Miami) that they
                    had lost whatever they had had as a result of the Bolshevik Revolution, so there
                    were many negative comments about what the communists were doing in the Soviet
                    Union. And this was very much in keeping with the mood of the times because
                    there was clearly a great deal of media coverage about the evils of communism.
                    And I have to say that while growing up I was somewhat contrary or rebellious
                    and would argue and debate these and other issues. In fact, our home in those
                    days — and this I very much enjoyed — in many respects resembled a Woody Allen
                    movie; we were never quiet or reserved.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like you brought the Russian kitchen table with
                        you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Absolutely. And in fact, the kitchen table persists to this day. My
                    parents have a large house now, and much of it is not actively used because
                    everyone comes and sits around the kitchen table with lots of food and endless
                    conversation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk a little about school, elementary school. The
                        southern school system, I think in that time was not, I mean, both the
                        segregation but also it was not particularly renowned as far as being
                        particularly good. I mean, but how did you find it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Well, let me go a step further. I do not know how I found it because I
                    did not have a point of comparison. Elementary school went by as a blur. I did
                    well and skipped a grade. Apparently the teachers thought I could do more
                    advanced work so I skipped fifth grade and went directly to sixth. And then in
                    junior high, the age when kids often go through a difficult transition, my
                    parents thought that perhaps sending me to a more academically rigorous boarding
                    school would be good for my development and self-discipline. I think there was
                    also the typical mother-daughter problem at that age but that is another issue.
                    And attending a Catholic boarding school, St. Angela's Academy was overall a
                    good experience for me. I learned something about religion (theology) and
                    academically it was, in fact, quite rigorous, essentially a Jesuit-type school
                    but co-ed. But I think what was most beneficial about the school was the fact
                    that even though it was less than 40 miles from home, many of the kids there
                    came from far more difficult environments or dysfunctional homes than I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had a family unit.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I had a very strong family unit. We fought, we argued, but we were very
                    close, and it was a good family. At St. Angela's , many of the boarders came
                    from miserable situations and were clearly unhappy. After a year, I was ready to
                    come home. When I came back to Barnwell High School I basically sailed through
                    it. And, this isn't bragging — I lots of honors and awards and high grades.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how about, you say desegregation followed behind
                        you. But was there much talk it the school about this? I am talking about
                        the students.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: Let me turn it around a bit because the students basically espoused the
                    prejudices of their parents to the extent that they did or did not talk about
                    it. Their opinions also in a way reflected the class structure of the small
                    community. There was not exactly a town-gown split since there was really no
                    “gown” but there was somewhat of an economic split, with the upper and middle
                    class townies versus the more rural students. The former, you might say were
                    taught better manners — they did not use words now deemed politically incorrect
                    in the popular culture whereas some of the kids who rode around in pick up
                    trucks with shotguns in the back may have been more openly prejudiced.</p>
                <p>In high school there were a number of incidents that were, frankly very
                    distressing for me. We're now already in the era of the civil rights movement
                    when, as you know, there was an active contingent of young, mostly northern
                    students coming south to work on voter registration drives. I very vividly
                    recall one such group came to Barnwell and tried to take some young black
                    children to the public library. But the librarians were afraid of what the local
                    white reaction would be if they let these children in, and so they turned them
                    away. And I remember feeling very ashamed. I also recall a separate incident
                    when I was 14 and had my first summer job as a “soda jerk” in a drugs store. In
                    those days blacks could come to the counter, order food and take it away but not
                    sit down. One day a young man came in and sat down and ordered a sandwich. As I
                    started making it, the store owner came forward and using unrepeatable language
                    told him to get out of there and not return. He was quite explicit as to what he
                    would do if the young man returned. Such incidents would not occur today, and
                    race is not a particularly major issue in the community. My younger brother, in
                    fact, went to a completely integrated school, and there were no problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well how did your family, given that your father ran a
                        factory and had to belong to the business class, talk about these
                        issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: I will give you an example of something that happened in the factory.
                    When he first arrived, bathrooms and water fountains were separated by race and
                    gender: four restrooms, two for women (by color) and two for men. One day
                    apparently there was a malfunction in one of these and a staff member asked my
                    father what to do. And my father gave somewhat of a Solomonesque reply, saying
                    he would leave it to the staff but if they did not wish to be miserable, he
                    suggested sharing the one available women's room. In the end, they did. There
                    was no racism and few discussions of race at home; my parents did not come from
                    that background and were probably hesitant to say much because they saw
                    themselves as outsiders. I recall my father telling a story about driving on a
                    country road one day with cars both in front and behind his that had hooded
                    Klansmen in them and him saying it was very frightening. But I really do not
                    want to imply that everyone was a racist or bigot, not by any stretch of the
                    imagination. Rather, I am simply saying there were incidents in those times. One
                    of the more striking I recall took place in high school at a school assembly.
                    Back then, there really did not seem to be restrictions on having “preachers”
                    come to talk to high school students. On one occasion, a local pastor gave an
                    address — not exactly a sermon — in which he stated that if any one of “ those
                    people, comes to my church”......</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He is talking about blacks.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Yes. But he did not use the term black or African American.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He used the “n” word.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: The “n” word. And, if any one of them comes through here, he said, “I
                    will get my shotgun”. And I remember sitting there thinking, and you call
                    yourself a pastor. So, to reiterate, most negative comments regarding race
                    seemed to come from the adults, not from the kids, who for the most part weren't
                    terribly interested in “those issues”.</p>

                        coming from- during the Depression and we were all very cautious about
                        anybody who came from what, I suppose we basically would call Oklahoma or
                        Arkansas because these were, you know, these were people, for guys, you
                        know, they would fight at the drop of a hat and I did not like to fight so
                        we just sort of kept them to one side. How did you find play, playmates and
                        all this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Well, when we first arrived we lived in a small house in what today
                    would be called a mixed neighborhood. It was adequate and we learned English,
                    real English (as opposed to the text book variety) from Queenie, the cleaning
                    lady and the cook, who looked like a stereotypical Aunt Jemima. But she taught
                    us well. Down the road there was a little shop run by a black merchant, often
                    filled with black children with whom I played, and still further down the road
                    an old woman, who as a little girl I liked to visit and watch as she made soap
                    in an old vat, stirring the lye for hours at a time. However, one day a
                    prominent member of the community who sort of took my father under his wing,
                    possibly seeing him as a nice young man who didn't fully grasp the local social
                    norms, said to my father something on the order of “ your child is still young,
                    and for now it is okay, but you probably do not want to allow her to play too
                    long with those children down the road. And for her sake, you might want to
                    think about moving to a different neighborhood. It's probably worth pointing out
                    that in fact, there was no residential zoning there, at least not in those days,
                    and young kids tended to play with whomever was around. Later on we moved to a
                    neighborhood that was predominantly white and again I was part of a pack of kids
                    who roamed all over the place. We had an enviable degree of freedom compared to
                    children today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, kids were feral in those days.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Definitely. Basically, we would come home for dinner.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And why are you inside the house? Get out and come home
                        for dinner. That is the way I grew up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: And we had all kinds of secret hideouts and places to play. There were
                    also some clay pits down the road on land that had once clearly been a
                    plantation; we once dug around and actually found what may have been Confederate
                    money.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you turn Catholic because of the Catholic school or
                        was this an exposure?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: It was a very good exposure, but in the end I didn't become a convert.
                    At that point I was 12 or 13 and very much a seeker. I had gone through
                    confirmation training in the Episcopal Church but at the last moment decided I
                    did not want to be confirmed. do that. Then I went to Catholic school and I was
                    the only non-Catholic enrolled in religion. The nuns were clearly pleased since
                    I was doing well in the class, and I think they saw me as a ready convert. At
                    the end of the year, school gave awards in each discipline. Although I won my
                    share of the awards, the only one I wanted was the religion award. I thought,
                    perversely, that it would be fitting for the only non-Catholic taking religion
                    to win the award. Ultimately, I missed it by a point but that's another story.
                    Unfortunately, one of the nuns pressed me a little too hard to convert. I think
                    if she had let me alone, I might well have converted but at that point there
                    were simply too many unanswered questions. By the time I left St. Angela's, I
                    decided not to do anything on this score, but felt that were I to be a Christian
                    I might well be a Catholic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering, you know, I am thinking of the South in
                        those days, that there was an awful lot of something that sort of city folks
                        today do not want to cross, and that is people sort of coming up to you and
                        have you been saved and that sort of thing. It was pretty aggressive
                        Christianity of the Southern Baptist variety; were you exposed to all
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Oh yes. But I think the more interesting angle is the fact that since
                    both of my parents had gone to Catholic schools, they considered parochial
                    education to be quite normal, but when we came to American they discovered that
                    there was not only anti-black prejudice but also strong anti-Catholic
                    sentiments. However, there was actually very little, if any, anti-Semitism. in
                    Barnwell. In fact, Barnwell had only three practicing Jewish families. One was
                    headed by the mayor, another by the speaker of the House of Representatives for
                    the state of South Carolina and the third was the owner of the leading
                    department store. And they were well established within the community. Now, the
                    Catholics had a much more difficult time. So when I came back home from Catholic
                    boarding school, still very caught up in the religion, I remember attending a
                    youth fellowship event at another local church which showed a film about sending
                    missionaries to Italy. When I mentioned that I had gone to a Catholic boarding
                    school, the kids were appalled — implying that Catholics ate heathen babies or
                    something of that sort. I no longer remember the specifics but the sentiments
                    were negative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I take it though that, looking back on it, this was
                        a pretty comfortable place, was it not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: In looking back, I think yes. Though going back to the question of the
                    local attitudes among the kids, I remember a high school reunion of a few years
                    ago, where there was another former Foreign Service (actually from USAID) in
                    attendance. We were talking with one of our classmates who was interested in
                    international issues although he had remained in the community when another
                    classmate came by and said “are you still talking about foreign affairs? Let's
                    talk about something more important”. She clearly meant more local news.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Very little because as you undoubtedly know, one reason so many textile-
                    related companies moved South in the '40s and '50s was that the region was not
                    very unionized, for many years unions were not much of an issue in my and
                    certainly not at the plant my father managed. . From what I understand, and what
                    I saw, he was a well respected and a very good manager.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...South Carolina side, not too long ago I started
                        interviewing a man who later became an ambassador several times, but his
                        father was a white, illiterate tenant farmer in South Carolina and was able
                        to break loose from that but just barely. I mean, by being able to go to
                        community college on a scholarship.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Your mentioning that reminds me that years later, when I was a graduate
                    student at Stanford, I became aware of how can prejudices go both ways. What was
                    fascinating to me was the number of stereotypes prejudices that people in other
                    parts of the country have about the South. In Palo Alto, I encountered people
                    who would express surprise on learning that I was from the south, as though I
                    were some sort of exceptional case. Occasionally, I found myself making up
                    stories about living in the South, which, unfortunately, people actually
                    believed. One of them was quite similar to what you just told me. Here I am at
                    Stanford telling people — not many to be sure and mostly to see their reaction —
                    that I was the child of a tenant farmer and the only one in the family to have
                    gotten an education (thanks to a scholarship, of course). But my goal after
                    finishing Stanford was to return and buy shoes for my many brothers and sisters.
                    And I mean they believed it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Well actually, I have been away for a long time. In fact, I will be home
                    for Thanksgiving; I am sure after I have been there for a day or two a little
                    bit will come back. But as I mentioned, my parents really made an effort to
                    broaden my horizons. For example, they sent me to a camp in New Jersey one
                    summer called Rova Farms that was founded by the Tolstoy Foundation and filled
                    with Russian �migr� kids, and we traveled whenever and wherever we could. But
                    after my brother came along some years later, I think thy perhaps grew concerned
                    that they were creating too much of a gypsy in me. With him, they seemed to
                    focus more on becoming more Americanized. Whether consciously or not, greater
                    attention was paid to Little League and scouting and Citadel summer camp.
                    Possibly as a result, he has more of a Southern drawl and probably considers
                    himself more of a Southerner.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I saw that more later on. I mean, there were certain things that you
                    grew up not questioning or even knowing about. For example, I don't recall
                    discussions about going into the Foreign Service or being a lawyer or other type
                    of professional with girlfriends in high school. In those days schools were
                    still offering home economics and secretarial skills in the expectation that
                    girls would end up as secretaries, homemakers and elementary school teachers. I
                    had a streak of rebelliousness did a lot of daydreaming on the swing in the
                    backyard and think about being a professor, a diplomat or a journalist — even a
                    social workers — when I grew up, and many of these dreams actually were
                    fulfilled. No one ever said I couldn't, but there was no particular
                    encouragement to go out and be a nuclear physicist.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the election of 1960, Kennedy versus Nixon, grab your

                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: No. The election that was more significant, not so much for my family as
                    for my school community, was the 1964 Johnson-Goldwater race, where a lot of
                    young people were for the first time interested in politics. And you had people
                    who would be embarrassed to admit this now but were “ Youth for Goldwater” then.
                    I think the 1963-64 period was one of real political awakening among the
                    brighter kids students in the high school. Except for a few news headlines and
                    the Nixon-Kennedy debate, I don't recall the 1960 election, but the
                    assassination of President Kennedy did have a real impact.</p>

                <p>TONGOUR: Sure, yes. I was involved in most everything. And I say this in the
                    sense that this was a small town and one participated in all the activities. You
                    played basketball, you were on the yearbook staff, the student council, and

                    comic presentation and compete with other participants on stage. I was also in
                    the school plays. In fact, one play in which I had the lead part was scheduled
                    for the day JFK was assassinated. This had a double significance for me and was
                    revealing about the attitudes of my father, who was politically quite
                    conservative..</p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Not socially conservative, however, but in the old “anti-Bolshevik”
                    sense. Given his anti-communist orientation, he had been more inclined toward
                    Nixon than Kennedy. Since the school play had long been scheduled those of us
                    involved had the day off. I always remember being in a “beauty shop” (as they
                    were known then) t getting my hair done when the radio announced the President
                    had been shot. And I recall returning home and my father saying “well certainly
                    they will cancel the play, they should cancel it.” But they did not cancel the
                    show and my father was outraged that the school had not shown sufficient respect
                    for the dead President, even if the local officials hadn't supported him. And he
                    was not happy with me either for continuing to play my part in the show.</p>

                    bowling alley. Actually — and this wasn't limited to Barnwell but true for many
                    small town — even though it is larger now, there were more things for kids to do
                    then. The bowling alley no longer exists, nor do the movie theaters. We also

                    be schools in Atlanta) sending representatives to area high schools to recruit
                    students. My family and I did visit some colleges as well, but it was a somewhat
                    haphazard process in terms of where I finally applied. However, I had met some
                    wonderful kids in New York who played an interesting role in my high school
                    development and college choices.</p>
                <p>My family's closest friends were living in New York, on Long Island, and they had
                    children who were a few years older than I. These kids and their friends had
                    already started college in places such as Swarthmore and Michigan, and several
                    had been involved in civil rights activities by the time of my junior year in
                    high school visit. To them, I was the little Southern girl come to visit whom
                    they would take to the big city. Although I had been to New York many times to
                    visit the grandmothers, that summer's forays into the city were different. They
                    college kids would take me to Greenwich Village and basically sneak me into
                    small clubs, not nightclubs exactly but '60s-style spots where you would hear
                    comics such as Mort Sol or clubs that seemed very avant garde to me at the time,
                    where interracial couples were common, and my friends would all look at me to
                    see if I was shocked, if the Southern girl could handle it. And I handled it
                    okay. But what was more significant to me was that in this groups was one very
                    impressive young African American woman who went to Swarthmore. She made such an
                    impression on me that I in the course of applying for colleges I applied to
                    Swarthmore. I also applied to a few others places, including William and Mary
                    and Emory University, where I was accepted. But Swarthmore sent me a letter
                    which I do not think could have been sent today to he effect that while I had
                    excellent grades the college really could not evaluate my performance since I
                    had attended a non-accredited school; moreover, the letter implied that given my
                    small town southern background I might not feel comfortable in Swarthmore's very
                    liberal environment. Those were not the exact words but that was the clear sense
                    of the message. I found this quite strange since I clearly would not have
                    applied if I didn't think I'd be comfortable there. In any case, it was not to
                    be.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, William and Mary was a different story. I wish you could have
                    seen my father's eyes light up at seeing this “real” American college town. I
                    wound up going to William and Mary. No one said I had to but it was definitely
                    the family preference. nice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Let us talk about William and Mary. You were there
                        in the mid-to-late 60s, right?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we are right in the middle of the student revolution
                        all this and never trust anyone under 30 and all that. Talk about, in the
                        first place, how the school impressed you when you first went there and what
                        the student body was like.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Well, William and Mary has changed a great deal over the years. When I
                    arrived, considerable attention was paid to the so-called “school priorities”,
                    things for which William and Mary was known. For example, first to receive its
                    charter and second in actual operation or the other way around (I no longer
                    remember), the first Phi Beta Kappa chapter, and so on. School officials were
                    quick to let “out of state” women know that they were “exceptional” students;
                    nevertheless, my freshman year at least, they sometimes also made us feel a bit
                    like second class in that they housed us in off-campus apartments. The college
                    claimed this wa due to a shortage of space but theoretically they could have
                    mixed up the freshmen class and allowed some out-of-staters to live on campus.
                    So on one hand, we were special but on the other, I used to joke, they seemed
                    afraid we might pollute the fine flower of Virginia womanhood. That set the
                    mood. I did make a lot of good friends. The great dilemma for me freshman year
                    was whether or not to join a sorority. In other words, the cultural revolution
                    had not yet hit Williamsburg, nor would it until several years later. I really
                    wasn't too keen about joining a sorority but felt almost as though I had to
                    because the Greek system was main form of social life on campus. In the end I
                    did join but was never much of a sorority woman and kept it somewhat at arm's
                    length.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I mean, particularly, I would imagine, sororities in
                        an extremely long established Southern college.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: That is right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, are pretty major institutions and a whole lot of
                        things go with it. At least, how did you find it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: Oh yes, that is exactly right. I wound up joining one of the least
                    “southern belle” type sororities or actually one of the more casual. But still
                    there were expectations to fulfill and it was hard to actually distance oneself.
                    In fact, I did live in the sorority house my senior year. But returning for a
                    moment to the issue of segregation and where I was coming from, one e very vivid
                    memory occurs from that year — a time when I felt as though I was living a
                    slightly schizophrenic existence, with the so-called “rah, rah” sorority life on
                    the one hand and participation in silent peace vigils (a minority position on
                    campus then) and more serious academic activities on the other. At the time,
                    there were very few African American students at William and Mary, and since I
                    was on the student newspaper, I wound up interviewing one of male students, who
                    interestingly enough, later joined the Foreign Service. At the time, however, he
                    was also dating a sorority sister, who, while not living in the house, would use
                    our room as her “alternate home”. One day a “committee” of sorority sisters came
                    by to ask whether — since I knew both the girl and the boyfriend — I would tell
                    her the sisters did not consider it appropriate (or didn't look good) for him to
                    escort her to the sorority house at the end of a date? I refused. But I mention
                    this to convey the flavor of the times and of how much has, in fact,
                    changed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let us talk about now about the academic side.
                        William and Mary has a fine reputation as an academic institution, probably
                        stronger one than the University of Virginia, which has a very good
                        reputation but also of being a very social school. What grabbed you and what
                        did not grab you, academic-wise?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Academically I thought it was excellent. Having come out of a small-town
                    high school, I actually had to study for a change. I mean, I swam through high
                    school and I do not remember doing too much studying. That changed at William
                    and Mary. I remember some truly outstanding professors in the liberal arts. I
                    majored in history but the courses that I took in English, economics and
                    psychology were great. And in fact, the history courses strongly influenced my
                    subsequent choices in terms of graduate work and gave me a good grounding for my
                    future career. I had no regrets about attending William and Mary and I probably
                    should have led this discussion with that fact. The only problem, in my view,
                    was that William and Mary never quite seemed to figure out how large a role
                    out-of- state students should play in the numerical make-up of the school, but
                    it was and remains an academically fine institution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were taking history; were you concentrating on
                        any area or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: Not at the time because for an undergraduate major, a certain number and
                    distribution of courses were required. So I took a little of this, a little of
                    that. I had an excellent Russian history professor. Plus, the team of American
                    history professors were all excellent. But my major in history was not what I
                    would call a strong major in that I took the requisite number of hours of
                    history classes but took a great many other courses in political science and so
                    on, whereas some classmates took as much history as possible. I certainly valued
                    what I learned during my four years there, but I must admit that for a time I
                    considered transferring to a more urban environment. At that time, Williamsburg
                    was a much smaller community and students for the most part could not live off
                    campus. Students were not allowed to keep vehicles, and there was a real sense
                    of isolation and what seemed to me a number of somewhat archaic rules.</p>
                <p>For example, walking across campus one day the Dean of Women stopped me and said
                    “Young lady, your skirt is not fully covering your kneecaps”. Women could not
                    wear slacks unless they were in art class or athletics. You could not walk with
                    a cigarette, etc. In other words, it was slow to catch up with the so-called
                    social or cultural revolution of the 60s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you know, my wife went to Stanford and they taught
                        gracious living. Was there sort of the campus Marxists or at least- I mean,
                        I am not talking about hard-core Marxists but you know, looking at sort of
                        the socialist type, were there any professors who were of that ilk or not or
                        was it a pretty conservative group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Overall the professors seemed fairly relatively conservative but not
                    exclusively so. Certainly there were professors from a wide variety of
                    backgrounds and university. I remember an economics professor who was very much
                    a provocateur, not necessarily a leftist provocateur but just a skeptic, forcing
                    us to question. I think there were a number of professors who were very good at
                    trying to get our gray cells working.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, let us talk about '64 to '68, the Vietnam War, the
                        changes. How removed were you from all that or were you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I was very conscious of what I saw as a cultural disconnect. I had a
                    part-time job, for example, working in a local colonial-style restaurant that
                    might have a TV on with news of the world but outside the window someone would
                    be riding a bicycle in colonial garb carrying a tray of food. So I would be
                    offering traditional hot cross buns while keeping an eye on the Vietnam War on
                    TV. There was definitely a sense of unreality associated with working or living
                    in colonial Williamsburg then. So Williamsburg may have been a late arrival onto
                    the awareness scene in terms of Vietnam, because it was very easy to live as
                    though you were living in the 18th century there. Still, I was well aware of the
                    war and by my senior year was involved in silent vigils in front of the student
                    union where maybe 20 people would show up.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh boy. Yes, so much for the revolution.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: That is right. You asked about “campus Marxists”. That label wasn't very
                    relevant at William and Mary. The people working on the student newspaper and
                    the more artsy crowd, many of whom I counted as friends, were the ones most
                    likely to question the system but hardly from a true Marxist perspective.
                    Essentially, one of the burning issues of the day centered on the draft, or
                    specifically one's draft status. So, while questions were raised, it was hardly
                    a hot bed of radicalism. However, by '68 that was changing even at William and
                    Mary, and by the time I got to California to go to grad school at Stanford (also
                    not known as a hot bed of radicalism) the mood was quite different everywhere.
                    Change was in the air. .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find, you know, looking at it sort of from a
                        distance and all, going to a school with men and women, well, it is still
                        sort of a male society; could you raise your voice? I mean, was it- did you
                        find being a woman you had to try a little harder to get attention or not?
                        How did you find that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I think that by the time I got to college this really was not much of an
                    issue. One very positive aspect of William and Mary was the general awareness of
                    the “caliber” of the Virginia women who attended. Since it is predominantly a
                    state school, it tended to attract the more academically oriented Virginia
                    women; those more interested in being prepped for “gracious living” tended to go
                    elsewhere. William and Mary women were frequently reminded that they were among
                    the “best and the brightest” of the state. In other words, women were not
                    necessarily held back except insofar as there were rules about skirt lengths or
                    smoking in public. What there was not, however, was much of a push or an
                    overwhelming expectation that women should continue on for advanced degrees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you, and I am looking back on it because at the time
                        you graduated, did you feel that you were the typical dumb- the child of
                        immigrants sort of pushed to get ahead or were you pretty much mainstream or
                        not at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I often felt as though I truly became an American when I moved to
                    California. California, for me, was the real watershed. I still felt slightly
                    ambivalent about my status while I was in an undergrad. I knew how to, you might
                    say, talk the talk but internally I still had this sense of being an outsider,
                    especially given the atmosphere of William and Mary. Had I gone to a different
                    undergraduate school, such as Georgetown or someplace more international, maybe
                    I would have felt differently. When I got to California I encountered incredible
                    diversity among the student body — among both the foreigners and the Americans —
                    and with all these different types, I felt very much at home. Does that make
                    sense?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. But I was wondering whether you felt, from your
                        family, was your family driving you or were you doing your own driving?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Oh no, they were not pushing me. They did not have a script for my
                    future and there was nothing particular that I was expected to do. By this
                    point, I was pushing myself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were on the right course, you know, I mean,
                        every immigrant family, you know, wants to see their kids-</hi>

                <p>TONGOUR: That is right.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Yes. You see, the message was “do your best, whatever you do.” In my
                    mother's case there was another implicit message associated with fulfilling some
                    of the fantasies of higher education and travel that she had not then attained,
                    but no one pressed me to become a Foreign Service officer or get a PhD.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like, too, the education you were getting that
                        you were not moving too far away from your parents, you were not really- Did
                        you find yourself growing estranged from them and their way or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: We had our share of arguments over the big issues of the day (our own
                    “war and peace”) but there was never any question of estrangement. We've a very
                    close family. It is just that my father's views and my own were very different
                    at that point on political issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, at that time I had a Marxist daughter, you
                        know.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Speaking of Marxism, I had an excellent Russian history professor at
                    William and Mary and that contributed substantially to my studying Russian
                    History in grad school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you keeping up with your Russian all this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: When I was growing up and through high school I did speak Russian at
                    home, but it was “kitchen Russian”; I didn't have the opportunity to study
                    Russian until considerably later. I took French in college; I'm not sure if
                    Russian was offered at William and Mary then. I took it in grad school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Alright then, now we can cover a little grad school. You
                        decided- why Stanford?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I was actually very fortunate on that front and confronted basically an
                    abundance of riches. I had applied to Columbia, in their journalism and
                    international relations program; I had also applied to the journalism program at
                    Northwestern; to SAIS (School of Advanced International Studies) in
                    international relations, and then to Stanford in Russian area studies and
                    history. In the end it got down to something very practical.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Money?TONGOUR: In part, but not completely. It got to be
                        somewhat complicated. I had spent a summer abroad in Paris after my
                        sophomore year in college, and it proved to be a very formative period in my
                        life for a number of reasons, not least of which was in raising all sorts of
                        questions about my national identity. I was quite happy in France, which
                        made me wonder all the more whether I was still a foreigner or an American?
                        Where did I belong? It took me much of my junior year basically to sort
                        through these questions. So, when I was accepted to SAIS, the school offered
                        me the opportunity to spend the first year its two-year program in Bologna
                        (instead of the second year which was more typical). SAIS may have thought
                        it was doing me a favor, but this became a source of great anxiety for me
                        and made me worry whether this would stir up the whole “nationality” issue
                        again. Perhaps, if SAIS had offered me the more traditional option I might
                        have made a different choice because in the end it was a toss up between
                        Johns Hopkins (SAIS) and Stanford. Stanford in those days had a very flush
                        fellowship program. My parents had paid my way through college but they were
                        not in a position to cover graduate school. Meanwhile, Stanford had Ford
                        Foundation grants for all those admitted to certain liberal arts programs. I
                        would love to be able to say that I had a real sense of what a Stanford
                        education represented, but I had never seen the place. I knew it was a good
                        school but so, too, were the others. The decision was made without a great
                        deal of forethought. In the end, I was very happy with my choice of
                        Stanford.</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the way, at any of this time had the Foreign Service
                        ever crossed your radar?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: Yes it did. I failed to mention that when I was a senior I had also
                    applied for a Fulbright grant to spend a year in Finland and had taken the
                    Foreign Service exam. I was 20 years old; I was young. I took the written exam
                    and passed it and then took the oral. . This was 1968. I'm stressed this because
                    the tests have changed many times since then, as have attitudes towards hiring
                    different categories of applicants. In that particular year and perhaps for many
                    years thereafter, the attitude toward hiring women for the Foreign Service, was
                    not, I would say, overwhelmingly favorable or enlightened. . Or let me rephrase
                    this. There had long been a few women in the Foreign Service, but they were the
                    exceptions and they were exceptional. W I took the oral exam, it seemed that
                    every third question dealt with my social life. They would never would ask such
                    questions today but in that era they would, for example, inquire: Miss Tongour,
                    what would you do if you married? And do you have a serious boyfriend? And have
                    you thought of the implications for your family life were you to join the
                    Foreign Service? After several such questions, I probably shot myself in the
                    foot by saying, “I guess if I were absolutely desperate I would marry a Foreign
                    Service officer” . I did not like the tenor of the questions and wasn't very
                    diplomatic in my response. I mention this only to give a flavor of how things
                    have changed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But also to give a flavor too to the attitude at the time.
                        One was, if a woman married she left the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: That is right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was actually not complete written in steel but it was
                        accepted.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Well, I actually knew of several cases, including the wife of a boss of
                    mine who had had to leave the Service once she got married. Years later she was
                    allowed to return.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. But also so, I mean, if you approved a woman you were
                        basically saying yes, she might be here for awhile and then leave. And there
                        has always been a higher attrition rate but in those days it was very high
                        so you in a way you were almost looking at somebody and saying will she get
                        married, you know.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I served on a panel but we have gone beyond that but this
                        is in the mid '70s but still, I mean, you could not get it out of your mind
                        because you said gosh, she is a very attractive woman but will she get
                        married.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: And so 10 years later — and this is a good segue — after I finished
                    college, attended graduate school and taught for a few years, I took the Foreign
                    Service exam again. This time I passed and without any such questions; if I
                    recall correctly, the panel focused on the Horn of Africa instead. Interestingly
                    enough, after telling me I passed, the examiners did ask why I had waited so
                    long to take the test a second time (in that period the examiners told you the
                    results the same day). I explained what I had been doing during the interval but
                    also allowed as how the attitudes toward admitting women and the questions asked
                    of them were quite different. To their credit, the examiners interviewing me
                    acknowledged that this was the case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I would say around '74 is about when things really
                        switched.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I understand that women were discussed on their husband's evaluation
                    form at least until 1972. In any event, I did consider the Foreign Service but
                    put it aside for a few years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, I think probably this is a good place to stop. So we
                        are going to pick this up in 1968.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Alright. Off to California.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Today is the 26th of November, 2007. Nadia, Stanford
                        1968. What was the campus- In the first place, how did Stanford impress you
                        and then let us talk about the campus life and what was going on then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Having spent four years in the very green environment in Williamsburg —
                    not in terms of environmental issues though we were aware of them but rather in
                    terms of foliage — in a traditional college campus town, I really had no idea
                    what to expect at Stanford. When I first arrived in California in September, the
                    dry season, I was amazed at how brown the campus was, and my initial reaction
                    was not all that positive. Visually I didn't find Stanford all that attractive
                    at first. How things — and one's tastes — change. Today, I find Stanford a
                    beautiful campus and I love the golden California hills which initially struck
                    me as strangely drab.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, that was mine. I went there after being here for some
                        time and I went on a sort of recruiting trip or something and I was sort of
                        struck by gee, this is not, you know, it is just kind of dry.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: Well it was. When I arrived, after having driven across country with a
                    friend, I remember thinking: how does one adjust to it? As a graduate student
                    you found your own housing and more or less fended for yourself. I remember
                    renting a cottage from a very devout Mormon family — my first encounter with
                    Mormonism. The parents themselves had attended Stanford and not left the area. I
                    quickly learned there were many like them, people who had gone to Stanford and
                    stayed in that environment, creating a somewhat “down on the farm” image, which
                    Stanford capitalized on, calling itself the “farm”. That was in contrast, at
                    least up until 1968, to Berkeley, which had always been perceived as more urban
                    and a bit bohemian even prior to the counterculture era — avant garde and
                    somewhat odd, from the Stanford perspective. But Stanford went through its own
                    metamorphosis in that period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were you sort of warned or leery about heading to
                        California during the- you were not too far from Haight-Ashbury and all
                        that; were your parents concerned about their little girl going there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: For good or for bad, my parents were not then very aware of the whole
                    Haight-Ashbury scene. It became well known in certain quarters but it was still
                    in the “almost happening” mode and too new for them to be fully conscious of it,
                    plus they saw me as somewhat of a gypsy in any case. And they did not really
                    have a strong sense of Palo Alto in relation to San Francisco at that point.
                    What was quite interesting was that within a matter of a few months after my
                    arrival, there was considerable agitation on campus, partly related to the war
                    and partly to the treatment of a fairly radical faculty member named Bruce
                    Franklin, who acquired some national notoriety on account of his leading a
                    protest march on a campus computer facility deemed to be contributing to the war
                    effort. The connection between Stanford's computers and what was going on in the
                    war was not totally clear, but they were perceived as being part of the old
                    “military industrial complex”. And the campus was abuzz; there were study groups
                    and public speakers agitating on one level or another against government policy.
                    We were all caught up in it to a certain extent, even those who did not come
                    from a very activist background.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there- At Berkeley you had a very vague dividing line
                        between sort of the followers, the campers on who were not really Berkeley
                        students but who were getting into the campus and all to protest or to hang
                        out or something. Was that...This is tape two, side one with Nadia Tongour.
                        Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: Stanford was just far enough away from the downtown that you had to make
                    a little effort to get from campus to town or vice verse. And Palo Alto
                    certainly wasn't a natural breeding ground, if you will, for radicalism.
                    However, there was a general “evolution” of consciousness, even among students
                    were not particularly radical, prompting a greater degree of awareness and
                    engagement in political activities of the day, including participation in
                    teach-ins and sit-ins. I myself got tear gassed once just once for participating
                    in what was supposed to be a peaceful walk towards the administrative building.
                    So, it was a time of ferment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, normally a grad student is somebody kind of aloof
                        from what kind of happened. What about you all, the grad students?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Perhaps that would normally have been the case (and perhaps was true in
                    the business school, though even among the professional schools there was some
                    involvement), but as a student of history and particularly for one focusing on
                    revolutionary movements since the 19th century, it all seemed quite relevant.
                    Frankly, I was not into any of the more radical activities, and some people
                    really did carry things too far. But at that point in time, there was truly
                    widespread disaffection with U.S. foreign policy. I was not thinking of going
                    into the Foreign Service at that moment, and my friends and I were not happy
                    with the way the war was going.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about campus life? Were people smoking pot and all
                        that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Well, let me go a step further and mention that when I had my Foreign
                    Service security clearance interview some years later the question arose. I
                    should point out that we were all aware that the worst thing in terms of the
                    clearance process was to be blackmailable. Secondly, it would have been
                    extremely difficult to have lived in California in 1969 or '71 or '72 and not
                    been at least exposed to pot. When I was I asked in my security interview, I
                    answered quite honestly saying I had tried it on occasion but could take it or
                    leave it. Actually, it was not illegal in California at the time. Possession was
                    not considered an infraction, but at most a misdemeanor and it was all pervasive
                    at social events.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We will move to the studies in a minute but while we are

                <p>TONGOUR: Definitely, but generally in a good way. n a sort of a hedonistic sense.
                    For example, I lived in several different housing situations including on my
                    own, with friends, and at one point in a co-ed house. The co-ed house had a very
                    strict moral code with no hanky panky in the house among the residents. Yet, it
                    was called a commune — we cooked together, shared a great deal and became close
                    friends. From that experience, I encountered quite a range of people, from the
                    extreme left politically to the extreme right, from the most bizarre to the
                    strait-laced. California had a very accepting climate, and for me, it allowed me
                    to feel very much at home. I often tell people that that's when I truly became
                    an American. .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any reflection of what was happening in Europe,
                        particularly in France during that time or not? I mean, was there sort of a
                        bubbling feeling of the students are going to take over?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: It would have been interesting to consider this question if I had gone
                    to graduate school in the east. I think my answer would have been different,
                    especially since I had already spent some time in Europe earlier on my own. But
                    California is far enough removed from Europe as a mind set that I do not think
                    that we were very aware that European youth were “in revolt”, beyond the more
                    general awareness that people everywhere seemed opposed to U.S. foreign policy,
                    and we tended to agree with them on many points.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let us talk about the studies. Were you involved
                        with the Hoover Institute?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I was, in fact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Hoover Institute is quite a- well, it is a unique
                        organization which has both sort of this great collection about revolutions
                        and all, particularly in Russia and all, at the same time being sort of an
                        arch conservative think tank. Tell me about your experiences there.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: Well first let me back up to say that this was not my first encounter
                    with arch conservatives inasmuch as I had spent a summer in college working for
                    a very conservative South Carolina congressman on what was then known as the
                    House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). But as I mentioned early, my
                    primary field in graduate school was Russian history, which required
                    considerable research at the Hoover Institution, particularly when I reached the
                    point of researching my dissertation topic, which dealt with �migr� diplomacy.
                    Specifically, I focused on the efforts of a group of ambassadors appointed by
                    the interim Kerensky government, who in late 1917 found themselves in Western
                    Europe at the outbreak of the Bolshevik Revolution and who subsequently sought
                    to influence the policies of European governments vis-a-vis the Soviet Union. I
                    mention this now because the Hoover Institution Library was the repository for
                    several major collections that I used in my dissertation research. In
                    particular, one Russian ambassador named Maklakov, who arrived at his post in
                    Paris literally on the day of the Russian Revolution, and who became sort or the
                    “ring leader” for the ambassadorial group seeking to influence European opinion,
                    donated his extensive archives to the Hoover Institute. Therefore, I eventually
                    spent a lot of time at Hoover doing dissertation research. Then too, at a later
                    point in my graduate career (after I had taken my oral exams and had begun my
                    own research) I obtained a part-time job working for an author you probably have
                    heard of named Bertram Wolfe, who wrote a number of books, including Three Who
                    Made a Revolution, about Lenin, Trotsky and Stalin. During this period, he was a
                    senior fellow at Hoover and I was his “research” assistant. Since he was then
                    writing his own memoirs, I hesitate to use the term “research assistant” because
                    he clearly knew more about his life than I ever could. But I did help out with
                    general research on the period in question (the 1920s and on) part-time for a
                    year while simultaneously doing my own research. .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: He had a fascinating background and was representative of the world of
                    so many neo-conservatives today, namely from the world of the “god that failed”.
                    In other words, he and others of his ilk had been extreme leftists in their
                    youth and then shifted 180 degrees. So he had been a “wobbly”, a member of the
                    International Workers of the World. He had also been a communist party member in
                    his younger years, and during a “red scare” period in the 20s, he and his wife
                    moved to Mexico where he got to know Trotsky and became friends with the artists
                    Diego Rivera, Frieda Kahlo and others. But he eventually broke with the
                    communists because of what he termed “American exceptionalism”. As he explained
                    it, he had no major objections to Stalin's policies in the Soviet Union, but he
                    did not want America to have to follow the Soviet line. So essentially he broke
                    from the party, and when he did so he gradually became more conservative —
                    anti-communist — over the years. When I worked for him, he was writing a multi
                    volume life story but he hadn't gotten much further than his boyhood in Brooklyn
                    and early years at City College of New York while I was there. Still, it was
                    fascinating working for him and meeting his associates, such as Sydney Hook and
                    others..</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kerensky? Was he there? .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: When I first arrived at Stanford, Kerensky was still alive and at
                    Hoover, but I only saw him infrequently and generally at a distance. We never
                    had any real conversations; he was quite elderly and not often around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you take to research and being a research
                        assistant but also to your own work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I have to say that this was somewhat of a muddle. While I very much
                    enjoyed working at the Institute, and had certainly enjoyed classes at Stanford,
                    my own research was fragmented, spread out if you will, over a number of years.
                    Partly this was due to the fact that I had taken some months off to travel. Then
                    I wound up working for Bertram Wolfe part-time, and later still I obtained a
                    teaching position at one of the California State University, in a town called
                    Chico. Consequently, I wound up teaching for nine months, then returning to the
                    Bay Area to work on the dissertation and then repeat the cycle a few more
                    times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you teaching?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Partly in my own field. I was very really fortunate in being hired for
                    what was called a one year “leave replacement position” which meant that the
                    person who normally taught Russian history would be on leave and I would replace
                    him for the year. Well, two-thirds of the way through the Department Chair
                    informed me that while the Russian History professor would be returning, the
                    Department also wanted me to stay. He said that if I returned, I could teach a
                    variety of courses — Western Civ, Modern France, basically fill in the blank. So
                    I did. I came back for a semester because they only had funds for one term and
                    then returned to the Bay Area for more dissertation work. Chico subsequently
                    obtained additional funds, and I went back for several more years — teaching
                    various history courses and working on the dissertation in the summers. This
                    basically went on for four years, but I was finally was able to pull it all
                    together and finish the dissertation. As I said, it was a chopped up process
                    although one I enjoyed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Chico. What was it like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Chico is about two hours and 40 minutes north of San Francisco, above
                    Sacramento. A charming town, particularly now. Today it has all amenities one
                    might night — coffee houses, good bookstores, etc, — but in those days it was
                    more limited, a good school but not a great one, with somewhat of a “party
                    school” reputation.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it connected- it was close to an agricultural area,
                        was that-?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Yes. But what it really had formerly been a teacher's college in its
                    early years. I assume you are familiar with the tier approach of the California
                    university system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: More or less; you might put it in so we will have it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: California has a wonderful university system with three main tiers, with
                    the many branches of the University of California at the top and the most
                    difficult to get into. Essentially, one has to have an A or an A-plus average
                    across the board because so many students in California would like to attend
                    schools such as Berkeley, Santa Cruz and so on. Then, there is the California
                    State tier, which nowadays probably requires a B average. Finally, there are all
                    the community and junior colleges. Chico was a school which had bright students
                    who for a variety of reasons may not have gone to one of the UC schools as well
                    as students with somewhat lower grades, but who usually had a wonderful college
                    experience. Chico was well known for its “Pioneer Week”, an annual event in
                    which everyone dressed as pioneers, built pioneers structures, and had a
                    wonderful time. I think in those days Playboy ranked Chico as one of the top
                    party schools in the nation. So that provides a bit of the flavor. My own
                    experience there was great. I enjoyed my colleagues and some of my students;
                    plus, I was commuting back and forth to the Bay Area quite ab it, both for
                    academic and personal reasons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the students?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I subsequently taught at a more prestigious college that overall had a
                    better quality (in terms of academic performance) of students. However, at
                    Chico, I found quite a range between the best and brightest to the lesser
                    lights. You encountered the entire academic range, and when they were good, they
                    were outstanding. But there were also a large number of students who did not
                    know what they were doing, where they were going but simply thought they should
                    be in college.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, all this time you were on the professor track, in
                        your mind.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: That is right. I was on the professor track. I also very much thought of
                    California as home. At the same time I was well aware of the then current
                    downturn in the academic job market. This was a sad fact for a whole generation
                    of graduate students at that time, namely we had entered grad school at the end
                    of the 60s, with a bit of cockiness about our prospects from having been
                    repeatedly told how wonderful we were and by the mid to late 70s, there were
                    fewer opportunities in academe.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were under 30, were you not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And, you know, I mean, you were absolved from original
                        sin.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Exactly. We were the boomer generation, and many of us had wonderful
                    university experiences, which we assumed would continue. I early on realized
                    that I loved the classroom experience. I loved teaching and the interaction with
                    students and colleagues. The research was fine but I was not really driven to
                    produce a seminal work in my field. And I had always been interested in foreign
                    affairs. As I previously mentioned I had, in fact, taken the Foreign Service
                    exam my senior year. What I discovered early on in graduate school is that the
                    academic job market in liberal arts had basically disappeared. I was lucky to
                    have had a one-year leave replacement position that turned into a four year
                    stint. Many of my friends quickly discovered that there were no jobs in their
                    particular fields. Even in my case, each year at Chico there was considerable
                    uncertainty as to whether funding would be available to hire me for another
                    semester or year. So during my third year there, I started considering other
                    options, specifically revisiting the idea of the Foreign Service, and I retook
                    the Foreign Service exam and this time passed both the written and the oral.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall any of the questions from the oral this
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: One question had to do with naming several books that had been
                    influential in terms of my understanding of American foreign policy. I recall
                    thinking the panel was probably shocked that I had put Fulbright's “The
                    Arrogance of Power” into the hopper as a significant work, but as long as one
                    could justify it as being influential or important, the panel accepted it, and
                    it did, in fact, influence a generation of students who were against the war. I
                    also remember that unlike the previous exam, they did not ask me any questions
                    about my personal life. It was a much more positive experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were in the academic thing did you get any feel
                        for the politics of academia and did this, for many people this is sort of
                        the turnoff. But I was wondering whether you-</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: It was definitely a turnoff. At the time, I was in a long term
                    relationship with someone who had studied at the Stanford Business School and
                    had a much more pragmatic view of the world, as did many of his friends. Later,
                    after I joined the Foreign Service, I used to joke that there was a real
                    spectrum in terms of how one measured success and productivity. In the business
                    world, they produce something — widgets or whatever — and the bottom line is
                    monetary. In government we produce programs, papers and sometimes policies, but
                    in academia one is judged largely by one's words and often one's your
                    rapier-like wit. Sometimes that can be very devastating. There can be a lot of
                    backbiting in academia and a fair amount of posturing as well. So the good news
                    regarding teaching at a college such as Chico, rather than Harvard, is the
                    relative lack of pretentiousness and academic intrigue or inter/intra
                    -departmental infighting one frequently encounters elsewhere. Towards the end of
                    my time at Chico, I not only took the Foreign Service exam but also, almost as a
                    matter of course, sent out my resume to several other colleges. Much to my
                    surprise, I received an invitation to come to upstate New York for an interview
                    at Hamilton College, a small school in the village of Clinton, New York.</p>

                <p>TONGOUR: And, this, too, was for a one year leave replacement position and in my
                    field. I do not know if I mentioned this earlier but in my family we always had
                    as slogan,” finish in beauty”, and I thought, well, the State Department takes a
                    long time, especially in those days with drawn-out security clearances, so,
                    perhaps, I should accept Hamilton's offer and finish my professional life in
                    academe “in beauty” at a nice liberal arts college in my field. And since my I
                    personal life had changed, I no longer had as strong a need to remain in
                    California.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your business major went on to business and you went on to
                        academics.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: That's really a long story but for the sake of this discussion, I could
                    say that I knew I probably needed to move on. So when Hamilton offered me the
                    job, I accepted. As I said, the State Department had not yet gotten back to me
                    with its own offer. So I drove across country once again. One of the nice
                    aspects of being from the east and studying in the west was that I got to know a
                    lot about the highways of America. I drove across country many times and tried
                    to vary my routes. This time I took a very northern route to arrive in the
                    charming village of Clinton and the very nice Hamilton College campus, a school
                    with a couple of thousand students. I wound up living in a house that had
                    earlier been used in the filming of the movie One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
                    Nest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes, oh yes, this is Ken Kesey's book about mental
                        illness.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: That is right, .and it was filmed right there. Hamilton was a very
                    positive teaching experience. The students were a bit different as a group from
                    what I had encountered at Chico. I liked the students at both schools, but after
                    having spent so many years in the often “counterculture” environment of
                    California environment, I found it a bit strange to teach students who tended to
                    be more conservative than the faculty. Many students then at Hamilton were very
                    “practical” in their orientation and concerned about their future — making
                    computer science course very popular. Overall, they seemed less idealistic than
                    what I was used to, but then again the economy and the times had changed. .</p>
                <p>Now we are in 1979 and a couple of months into the school year the State
                    Department contacted me and invited me to come on board — in three weeks — after
                    not having been in touch for many months. I explained that teaching college
                    wasn't quite like working for a corporation where you could simply give two
                    weeks notice. I also indicated that while I was certainly interested, I couldn't
                    just leave in the middle of the school year, and certainly not within a few
                    weeks. And the gentleman who made the offer — I'll never forget — said well we
                    will keep you on the list but we cannot promise to get back to you at the end of
                    the school year. I answered that I would then have to take my chances since I
                    couldn't simply abandon my job at Hamilton. So, to make a long story short, I
                    had no idea whether the State Department would repeat its offer but two-thirds
                    of the way through the school year, the chairman of my department at Hamilton
                    invited me back for another year, to teach other courses such as modern France,
                    modern Germany — fill in the blank. And all of a sudden I knew that I did not
                    want to do that. It had nothing to do with Hamilton but I had already had a
                    similar experience at Chico and was beginning to tire of one year “leave
                    replacement positions” being extended indefinitely. I also have to admit that I
                    had a problem with the weather in upstate New York. Having grown up in the south
                    and then lived in California, I had never been so cold in my life as I had been
                    that year. I remember once going to a movie in the nearby town of Utica and on
                    leaving the theater, some distance from my car, I ran and even so my fingers
                    were frozen. When I got into the car, after having just seen a movie about sunny
                    California, I sat there for some time wondering what on earth I was doing there.
                    So in the end, m line, I said thank you but no, I will return to California. I
                    wasn't sure whether the State Department would offer me another position or if I
                    would find a job, but I felt as though I was for once casting my fate to the
                    wind..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you mentioned something about the student body being
                        more conservative. On my 50th anniversary graduating- I graduated from a
                        school very similar to Hamilton called Williams.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Oh yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And I remember talking to a professor who was saying you
                        know, I think he taught philosophy, and he said these are very bright
                        students but you feel like you are turning out investment bankers and this
                        is not a very inspiring crew.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: And I think Williams may have been more inspiring than Hamilton. I say
                    this only because Williams was often more highly ranked among small liberal arts
                    colleges. Many of the students at Hamilton that I knew had at some point
                    indicated they had really wanted to go to Williams.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is usually in U.S. News and World Report; the ranking
                        is usually one or two each year among small colleges.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: That is right. There were many students who, when asked where else did
                    you apply or want to attend would indicate that Williams had been their first
                    choice with Hamilton a close second. Actually, Hamilton has produced many, many
                    fine diplomats, and my experience there served me well in a later incarnation.
                    It was a lovely campus, and I still have friends from there and we do visit.
                    perhaps there were not enough hellions or eccentrics for that matter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, it tends to be, you know, too many people who rank
                        very high does not necessarily make for a good mix.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Exactly. As I said, there were times when you just wanted to shake them
                    up a bit. And in fact, I volunteered to teach a course of “contemporary
                    terrorism”. Hamilton had a fascinating program then which I wish more colleges
                    had, though I'm not sure it even still exists at Hamilton, namely a three-week
                    term in January in which students are allowed to travel, study abroad, or take
                    courses that were often a bit off the “major track”. It could be photography or
                    Russian literature, and this provided faculty their own opportunity to refresh
                    their brains by offering a course of some interest both to themselves and their
                    students. So I proposed and taught a course on modern terrorism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh boy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I really wasn't being prescient, but simply interested in the topic
                    because Russian history was filled with all sorts of anarchists and
                    revolutionaries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Palestinians were doing their thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: They were. As was the Bader-Meinhof Gang.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the Red Army in Japan.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: That's true. At that point, however, “modern terrorism” was oriented
                    more toward European groups and to some extent the PLO, rather than the groups
                    we're seized with today. And the course fit very nicely into a three-week
                    timeframe. week course. We did not have quite the legacy we do today; now such a
                    course would take considerably longer. I found it to be a fascinating teaching
                    and research experience for me. Overall, Hamilton was a good experience as well,
                    but when I left, I liked the idea that for once in my life I was not programmed
                    and really did not know what I'd be doing next, beyond visiting my family in the
                    south and then driving West to California.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Get away from the snow, of course, by that time it was
                        spring, I guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: It snowed on June 6th , not a great deal but enough to make me ready for
                    a warmed clime. . So I drove back to California and house-sat the home of some
                    friends while I started looking around for jobs. My parents called a few weeks
                    later to let me know that I had received a letter from the State Department, and
                    I asked them to open it. As luck would have it, the lettered invited me to enter
                    a Foreign Service class starting in little more than a month. I was very torn.
                    On one hand, I was clearly interested, but having just driven all the way back
                    to California, I also wanted to see what I might do there. So I called the
                    Department and asked whether it was absolutely necessary to begin in August.
                    Much to my surprise, my contact replied that I could, in fact, enter in late
                    September, instead. As it turned out, this had little to do with me but rather
                    was due to upcoming changes in the overall State Department personnel system at
                    the end of 1980. So that was that. Obviously, there was initial indecision and
                    “agonizing” over what to do, but in the end, I decided to take yet another drive
                    across country and give the Foreign Service a try.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Alright, you started then in September of 1980?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: End of September.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: End of September. Okay, how would you characterize,
                        describe your basic officer's course, in other words the A-100 course?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: As is so often the case when one is a freshman at anything one winds up
                    bonding with a core group of classmates. My A-100 class was fairly close. It
                    also produced a number of success stories and a number of ambassadors. It was a
                    very collegial and nice group of people. But I had no idea at the time how many
                    of them already came from within the “family”. these people came from the
                    family. In other words, I later found out that many of my classmates' fathers
                    had been Foreign Service Officers, even ambassadors, and that one of my best
                    friends in that class was herself the daughter of an ambassador. So there were a
                    number of people who came from this world. There were also a large number who
                    came from at SAIS or Fletcher. Yet, there were others of us who came from more
                    eclectic backgrounds — from Peace Corps, law school or even teaching, but the
                    majority seemed to had entered shortly after studying international relations in
                    graduate school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about mix, male, female, women, minorities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I think yes, here is an issue. We have come a long way. But still,
                    within that A-100 class the majority were male, white male, but maybe not as
                    many “to the manor born” as had been the case in earlier generations. There was
                    a smattering of males who were non-white — at least one Hispanic and one from a
                    Chinese background. There were a good number of women compared to years past
                    gone by but what was noteworthy about the women was that overwhelmingly they
                    were assigned to the consular cone. I happened to have been assigned to the
                    political cone and that was considered highly unusual for a woman then. In fact,
                    later on there was a class action suit involving some women from my class who,
                    believed they had had the same background as many of the men and yet — we had no
                    choice then — were consigned to the consular cone. So that was probably one
                    fundamental difference from today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the introduction, the training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I thought it was very good. What was particularly interesting was the
                    actual “assignment process” to determine where we would be sent. Unlike in
                    future assignments, we were given a modified “bid list” with only a fixed number
                    of postings included. In my case, I really wanted to learn something new. I had
                    been teaching Russian history, focusing on Europe for years. I actually wanted
                    to learn Spanish and go to a Spanish-speaking country. Given the need for visa
                    officers in Mexico and throughout Latin America, it was easy to get what I
                    wanted. As for the training, the five or six weeks of A-100 training, followed
                    by the introductory consular course and language training for Spanish at the
                    Foreign Service Institute, that all gave me a good 7 or 8 months of training
                    before I left for post. I thought it was a good system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were leaning, you were pointing towards the Western

                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: Well, I certainly recall putting Mexico City and Buenos Aires high on my
                    list. Our abbreviated list had a handful more postings than we had people in our
                    class. Quite honestly, I no longer remember the exact numbers but to the best of
                    my recollection, Moscow was not on the list.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Usually it would not be for the first-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: No. Even had it been, I would have to admit that after having just spent
                    a winter in upstate New York, I was not looking for a posting in a cold climate
                    just then. Meanwhile, the notion of learning about a new region and a new
                    language was definitely appealing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well tell me, I am trying to pick up an attitude. When you
                        were there, could you- were you picking up an attitude both in general and
                        more specifically the Foreign Service about where women were going? I mean,
                        this was 1980, you know, things were really changing. How did you feel about
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: It did not occur to me. Having done much of what I wanted to do as a
                    woman up to this point I was not as conscious of the women's issue in the
                    Foreign Service as I would become a very short time later. I did not know, for
                    example, of the tradition of including (until 1972) wives in their husbands'
                    performance evaluation&gt; Nor did I know that women officers had been expected
                    to resign if they got married. That had changed by 1980, but “different”
                    attitudes were still apparent. And here are some examples.</p>
                <p>One centered on concern over protocol.. I remember in the A-100 class a Protocol
                    Officer spoke to us about how protocol had evolved for women and how previously
                    wives were expected to call on different women in other missions. There was a
                    whole ritual associated with turning down the corners of their calling cards to
                    indicate that they had visited. I vividly recall giggling at this description
                    and finding it slightly off-putting. Later when talking to a friend who had been
                    raised in the system about the presentation, she was appalled that I — along
                    with other colleagues — had not found the protocol discussion terribly edifying
                    and had even laughed about the calling cards. For me, this was a different
                    world..</p>
                <p>A second difference dealt with vocabulary, both the specific acronyms and the
                    somewhat different usage of English terms. For example, I remember one of our
                    A-100 instructors repeatedly using the phrase, “flag it to me.” I had no idea
                    what “flat it to me” meant. I no longer have to think about it but we actually
                    don't even use that phrase much anymore. But there were a number of terms that
                    remain part of our vernacular that others do not necessarily understand. And
                    even some of the common terms we use today, such as our reference to working on
                    a desk or having a “portfolio” have a different connotation in other
                    professions.</p>

                </p>
                <p>You know, something I did not ask you before, as I have been doing these oral
                    histories, I started with people actually coming in in the 20s but basically
                    after World War II, and I happen to be straddling and I consider probably the
                    most significant social movement that involves slightly over 50 percent of our
                    population and that is the role of women. During your time at the universities
                    how did women's lib hit you? Let us take it up to the time you got in the
                    Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Let me say that while I answered honestly before, I undoubtedly omitted
                    some important points that I may have not thought about in years, namely that
                    while on one level we were certainly treated as equals — admitted to graduate
                    programs and professional activities. On another level the faculty I studied
                    under came from a different era and cultural milieu. Specifically, a number of
                    my professors were from Eastern or Central Europe. They could be quite charming
                    but they essentially saw “the ladies' us as one of two types of women. Either we
                    were to be figuratively patted on the head and expected to serve spaghetti at
                    the student get togethers or, without using pejorative terms, we were
                    effectively “neutered”.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Almost asexual.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: Asexual is right, or “honorary” men, much as some women diplomats are
                    treated in parts of the Middle East. For the most part, it was only gently
                    patronizing with women students treated as charming additions to the group. They
                    did not deny our intelligence but, not unlike an earlier Foreign Service
                    attitude, they assumed we probably would not last and would give up our careers
                    for family or other reasons. And so there was not quite the same emphasis on
                    ensuring we got the same breaks. On a certain level we did fall into the
                    “spaghetti making category”. By the same token, there was a bit of resentment
                    for the attitudes associated with it. We were becoming increasingly more aware,
                    conscious if you will, of the women's movement, and it made a difference in our
                    lives. My own circle of friends were drawn to an Australian writer named
                    Germaine Greer, who spoke at Stanford while we were there. I remember that she
                    was beautifully dressed and very well put together which prompted one of the
                    more militant women in the audience to question why she wore makeup or fancy
                    clothes. And she replied, “I do it for myself”. She didn't deny that she was
                    influenced by her environment but noted she would not feel better about herself
                    had she been slovenly. My friends and I were more or less of that ilk. We were
                    trying to push the envelope and be more independent but by the same token, we
                    carried our baggage from the past as well.</p>
                <p>Back to the Foreign Service and my first tour in Mexico City. Shortly after I
                    arrived in Mexico, the country had its first currency devaluation in many years.
                    In fact, within a matter of a few months the peso went from 26 to well over 100
                    to the dollar, and there was a lag of at least six months before prices began to
                    catch up. What that meant was that a junior officer making a pittance by
                    comparison to today could do almost anything. We could travel at very little
                    cost all over the country, and we did. Flying to Acapulco cost roughly $10 or
                    the equivalent. We could eat out wherever we wanted — and afford it. As a result
                    we had a sort of a roving band of young people who got together to explore
                    different aspects of the country, eating out frequently and traveling a great
                    deal. It was a wonderful time for us in that regard. But it was fascinating in
                    other respects as well. For example, within the Embassy context, we had a “play
                    reading” group, organized by four of us women who were from different agencies
                    We, the organizers, were quite junior in rank but over time we wound up inviting
                    various people to take parts in the readings and we staged the events in the
                    homes (generally larger) of more senior officers. We would rehearse the play
                    over a weekend and then put on the show on a Sunday evening. These events were
                    really quite popular. As a result we got to know a wide range of Embassy
                    personnel and made many new friends in the process. One of our actors became
                    quite famous, or perhaps I should say infamous, namely Rick (Aldrich) Ames, now
                    known for his espionage activities, but then simply a good actor and one of
                    those taking part in the readings.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>Personally, this was a positive period, marked by a close circle of friends, a
                    good social life, considerable travel all around the country — not to mention
                    some unusual and interesting assignments during the tour. The ambassador at the
                    time was John Gavin, an actor and close friend of President Reagan; however some
                    Mexican officials were not thrilled at the prospect of having a Spanish-speaking
                    actor as the American ambassador. They had hoped for someone more “serious” or
                    with more gravitas along the lines of Sen. Jacob Javits. Instead, they got
                    Gavin, who came with two Special Assistants.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The temple dogs, I think they were called.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: You have heard of this group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk about it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: You mean the general impression?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes; talk about how this worked.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: The situation was somewhat unusual in that most ambassadors don't have
                    two such assistants, who were also political appointees. One of the two was
                    okay; he subsequently married a close friend of mine, and we remain on friendly
                    terms. The other was more noteworthy in the negative sense because he created
                    what could only be called a nightmarish situation for many of the staff. My
                    involvement stemmed from the fact that he decided that the Front Office needed
                    not only these special assistants but staff assistants, drawn from the junior
                    officer pool, as well. These staff assistants would be comparable to staff
                    assistants — preparing “Night Notes”, assembling papers, etc. The Special
                    Assistants would pick from among the young consular officers and “honor” the
                    designee by allowing the person selected to work in the Front Office for three
                    or four months at a time. I was selected among the first crop to do this.
                    However, it was not exactly a happy environment since one of the so-called
                    “temple dogs” was without a doubt one of the meaner human beings I've run into;
                    fortunately, he was not a career Foreign Service officer. Actually, he had
                    started out in the Foreign Service, left, and then returned as a “Schedule C”
                    appointee. He reduced a number of people to tears. In that regard, I was lucky.
                    Still, as my tenure in that position was drawing to a close, he very pointedly
                    told me that if I ever talked about anything I witnessed in the Front Office, he
                    could ruin my Foreign Service career. Although there really wasn't that much to
                    report, and after all these years the threat is meaningless, it, nevertheless,
                    left a bad taste in my month. Fortunately, my last six months at post were spent
                    in a very different and much more satisfying office. I wound up working for the
                    Consul General. Mexico City had an unusual organizational structure. First of
                    all, there was the ambassador with his two special assistants and a staff
                    assistant, and there there were two Consuls General — both of whom were
                    excellent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I understand that the special assistants sort of bypassed
                        the DCM.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Absolutely. And the DCM was an okay guy but he was often by-passed and
                    not treated much better, from what I could see, than the lowly junior staff
                    assistant. So it was not a happy situation. Paradoxically, the negative
                    environment in the Front Office contribute to a great deal of bonding and good
                    morale among the rest of the staff, with everyone else in agreement about how
                    horrible the management was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Gavin and his operation? I
                        realize this was your first time in the Foreign Service but what were you
                        picking up?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: Gavin wanted to be taken seriously. He did not want to be seen as merely
                    a handsome actor. Actually, Gavin had also gone to Stanford and there were
                    several people other Embassy staff who had also attended Stanford, and Gavin
                    took a picture with us as a group. Overall, he probably was not a bad
                    ambassador, especially considering the expectations people had about him. I know
                    he tried to bring high-ranking Administration officials, Senators and heads of
                    Agencies to Mexico. I remember a visit by Charlie Wick, the head of USIA, as
                    well as some “literati” such as James Michener and E.L. Doctorow who came down
                    as part of a cultural exchange program.</p>
                <p>There were a number of VIPs who came down for one reason or another, but I think
                    you hit the nail on the head in noting that junior officers learn more about the
                    dynamics of a post and perhaps less about the substance of bilateral policy. In
                    other words, I was not privy to what the Ambassador might have said to the
                    Foreign Ministry on any particular issue, and even in those instances where I
                    might have had some insights, it was too long ago to remember the details. What
                    I do recall is that he was a man very conscious of his surroundings and that
                    which affected him personally. Let's put it this way. He would not have been my
                    candidate for an assignment to a hardship post, because he did not deal well
                    with discomfort. For example, he insisted on having the whole air filtration
                    system of the Embassy modified so as to have only pure air in his office, and so
                    on. Clearly, a certain degree of self-importance in this regard. But he was
                    perfectly amiable to those whom he encountered. In terms of junior staff, that
                    did not happen very often since he wasn't the type to spend much time down on
                    the visa line. A lot of the scut work was left to the DCM.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was his wife a factor, Gavin's wife, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: A factor? She came to visit periodically but she, Constance Powers, was
                    a television soap opera star as well as an actress in various films. She
                    definitely added a touch of glamour to the place and in that sense could be seen
                    as a factor. I recall other celebrities coming down with her, such as Bianca
                    Jagger, who had a genuine interest in Central America. So to be sure, there was
                    a certain air of glitziness that accompanied their presence at post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Let us get down in the trenches. In the first place,
                        do you have any consular stories?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Lots of consular stories.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let us have a few.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: First of all, let me tell you that the recent Assistant Secretary for
                    Consular Affairs Maura Hardy was on the visa line with me then,. Interestingly
                    enough, Maura was also one of the few women in our group who began her career as
                    a political cone officer. However, she really enjoyed consular work and sought
                    to switch cones. And of course, this was not difficult. Consular Affairs was
                    delighted to have her. Meanwhile, among the consular stories I vividly recall
                    was one having to do with the consular training we received at FSI. One day our
                    trainer for visas told us that undoubtedly at some point in our visa experience
                    we would break the law — not necessarily out of fraud or for some other horrible
                    reason, but we would break the rules all the same. His point was that we needed
                    to understand what and why we were doing doing so. That made a strong impression
                    on me. Frankly at first I wondered what he was talking about. I had no intention
                    of breaking the law — and apart from one possible exception, probably never did
                    (at least not knowingly). Early on, however, I got what we called a “visa
                    turnback”, meaning I issued a visa to someone who was turned back at the border.
                    It turns out I gave a visa to an old woman, who was turned back because she had
                    a police record in Texas, where apparently she had been a prostitute in her
                    youth. Well, my colleagues found this hysterically funny and teased me endlessly
                    about my giving a visa to someone with a record of “moral turpitude”.</p>
                <p>Some months later, I was working away on the visa line when a young man applied
                    for a non-immigrant visa. I remember he said he was from the state of Chiapas in
                    the far south of Mexico. He also said he had walked all the way to Mexico City
                    in hopes of obtaining a visa to spend three months picking lettuce in the
                    Salinas Valley (California). I explained that we did not have visas for such
                    work ( the rules on that score have changed over the years but then there was no
                    such category). He insisted he wanted to be “legal”, that he could have paid a
                    “coyote” to get him across but he had a new wife and wanted to return home and
                    build here a house in Chiapas after working three or four months in California.
                    I must say that rarely did I find myself believing stories of this type. I got
                    to be savvy about spotting them for what they were. Yet for some reason I
                    believed this young man truly wanted to come back to beautiful Chiapas and would
                    try to do so; whether he would succeed or not was another story. I wound up
                    giving him a one entry, three month visa, think to myself that the immigration
                    authorities probably would not let him enter, but inwardly I wished him luck. I
                    hoped he could fulfill his ream, work three months and then return home. So this
                    was the one time in my Foreign Service career I may have not strictly adhered to
                    the rules but I didn't feel too badly about it. .</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we have all, I am a professional consular officer
                        and more than once I have said oh, the hell with it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I know. And I am sure you have some wonderful stories to tell. One last
                    anecdote to pass on centered on an old woman or at least one who looked ancient
                    but probably was no more than 45, and who said she had 14 or 15 children. When I
                    jokingly asked whether she hoped to have more, she answered “whatever God will
                    give me” and she seemed to mean it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who else was on the line with you, do you recall any of
                        the people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I actually do because a number of my co-workers have remained good
                    friends, and that often may be one of the nicest aspects of first tours, because
                    considerable bonding usually occurs among junior officers on the visa line. I
                    mentioned my A-100 friend Frances Jones; she was also assigned to Mexico City.
                    Jonathan Farrar, now our Chief of the Interest Section in Havana was recently my
                    supervisor in the Bureau of Human Rights and Democracy (DRL) where he was the
                    Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary. A number of other friends have already
                    retired, but we remain close.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find- was it a little hard at the beginning to say
                        no?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: No, it was the other way around. At the beginning you are fresh out of
                    training and filled with a sense of virtue. There is probably no one tougher on
                    visa applicants than a brand new visa officer. We were sticking to the rules. It
                    is only after you have been around for awhile and have heard so many cockamamie
                    stories that on occasion you feel sympathetic. After a thousand people apply to
                    “visit Chicago strictly to get to know the city in January”, someone comes along
                    that simply wants to pick lettuce, you sometimes soften and let them go. I think
                    that you are harder in the beginning as well as slower because you do not trust
                    your own judgment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was your consular general at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Well, after the less than edifying experience in the Front Office I had
                    the good fortune to work for Larry Lane and MaryAnn Meysenburg who had a
                    somewhat unusual division of responsibilities. Larry Lane was the overall
                    supervisory Consul General for all 13 consulates in Mexico City, and MaryAnn
                    Meysenburg had specific responsibility for Con Gen Merida. By the way, as an
                    example of the “old” Foreign Service, Larry Lane's wife also served at Post but
                    she had had to drop out of the Foreign Service years before because she had
                    married her A-100 classmate, Larry. She was out for a number of years before
                    being able to reenter the service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in any protection and welfare
                        American services type thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: A little bit but basically after my stint in the Front Office, I
                    basically acted as Larry Lane's special assistant, a somewhat unusual assignment
                    as well, focusing more on constituent posts and less on Mexico City. Still, we
                    all had to be duty officers and deal, unfortunately, with death cases and
                    robberies. .</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did, as duty officers how did you view sort of the
                        Mexican system, police, etc., etc.? I mean, so many robberies, things of
                        this nature, what was your impression?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Well, I saw it more readily just living in Mexico not so much as a duty
                    officer. I mean, we were all very familiar with the issue of Mordida, which is
                    the “bite” or the bribe, which many people wound up paying to avoid being
                    ticketed for alleged moving violations and other minor infractions. Clearly,
                    there was a lot of corruption at the time, which I am sure continues to
                    exist.</p>
                <p>Actually, I might mention as a sideline another anecdote about life in Mexico
                    City , a very exciting place to live in those days. I happened to live very
                    close to the Embassy but also near the area known as the Zona Rosa, which was
                    filled with shops and restaurants. When I arrived, officers had to find their
                    own apartments (this has subsequently changed). I do not recall how I stumbled
                    onto my apartment, but I found a place that was only four blocks from the
                    Embassy. When people asked where I would be living, I mentioned the name of the
                    street. It so happened that all the streets in that neighborhood were named
                    after rivers — indeed throughout the city there seemed to be “themes” associated
                    with the names of streets in particular areas. Yet whenever I mentioned the name
                    of “my river”, Mexicans would often smile in a somewhat strange manner, leading
                    me to realize that there was something a bit odd about the street which no one
                    seemed to want to explain. It took me a few weeks of living there to discover
                    that only a couple of blocks away from my apartment was a famous rendezvous spot
                    for street walkers. There were certainly other more reputable souls living in
                    the area. Still, there was a fair bit of action in the neighborhood.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Well then you were there until '83?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel by that time about the Foreign Service
                        and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: At that time I loved it. Like any profession, there were ups and downs,
                    and some bosses were better than others. As I mentioned, however, there was a
                    great deal of camaraderie “in the trenches” and the posting seems to have had a
                    positive impact on many of us. One of my supervisors from that period, who is
                    now well into his 80s, still works part-time at State. As for me, I was
                    fortunate to obtain as my second assignment a position that had greater
                    relevance to my academic background, working in Washington on what was then
                    known as the Soviet Desk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were on the Soviet desk from '83 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: To mid '85.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well do you want to talk about in the first place, how the
                        Soviet desk was constituted and then we will talk about what you were
                        covering, the developments.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Actually, I served on the so-called Soviet desk twice, and each tour was
                    quite different. In my first assignment, there were at least four distinct
                    offices under the umbrella of the Soviet Desk. One of these dealt with bilateral
                    relations, which was the office I worked in; another focused on multilateral
                    affairs. A third covered scientific issues, and the fourth, I think, focused on
                    educational and exchange programs. And, of course, there was a small Front
                    Office, then headed by an outstanding Director, named Tom Simons.</p>
                <p>He had an excellent career in the Soviet/East European area, including a stint as
                    Ambassador to Poland. I've lost track of him but initially after retiring, he
                    spent some time at Stanford. I had a lot of respect for him, but he definitely
                    came from the traditional Foreign Service background. I think his father had
                    been a diplomat as well, and Tom himself had gone to ivy league schools —
                    Princeton and Harvard I think. So he could be described as being of the old
                    guard. Yet, that said, there was no chore beneath him. If someone needed to dump
                    ashtrays, make copies, or bring in additional chairs for a meeting, he was
                    perfectly willing to help out. So, he represented a super intelligent, big
                    picture thinker who at the same time was able to do whatever needed to be done.
                    In short an excellent boss. Fortunately, my section chief was outstanding as
                    well. As for my own responsibilities, they were somewhat mixed. I had to deal
                    both with security issues, particularly as related to the New Office Building
                    (NOB) being built in Moscow and with questions involving dissidents,
                    particularly religious dissidents. It was an odd mesh.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But both very important at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: That they were. My work also often included many things that did not
                    fall neatly into any one category but were fascinating all the same. But in the
                    case of security, the issue of most critical importance then and subsequently
                    had to do with listening devices and bugs planted in our new compound in Moscow;
                    we were both conscious of these and very concerned about what needed to be do.
                    Obviously, this is a sensitive topic about which I really can't say very
                    much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, at that time, I mean, we were building a new
                        embassy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: That is right.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the place was just riddled with listening devices. Was
                        this public knowledge at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: This was a key. It was not public knowledge at that time but became so
                    two or three years later and various congressmen were outraged. Unfortunately,
                    they were under the mistaken impression that the State Department had been in
                    the dark about this. We were well aware of the problem. However, there were
                    differing views within the interagency community as to the best course of
                    action. Does one wait until the building is completed and then take them out or
                    do so piece meal, etc ?. There were various schools of thought on the matter and
                    on policy implications vis-a-vis our relationship with the Soviets. .</p>
                <p>There were other issues as well, including the treatment of dissident minority
                    groups. And there was a case I personally got involved with concerning a young
                    would-be defector. The young man was the teen-age son of a high ranking diplomat
                    who was due to return to Moscow. The kid did not want to return to the Soviet
                    Union with his parents..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was quite young, was he not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Yes, he was about 14 or 15 — I no longer remember his exact age. In any
                    case, he ran away — to an American friend's home as I recall — but eventually
                    Soviet Embassy officials “nabbed” with the intention of sending him swiftly back
                    to Moscow. For our part, we tried to submit demarches advising the Soviets not
                    to put the boy on a plane before we had had a chance to ascertain his
                    intentions. Otherwise, we knew that there could be horrible repercussions, not
                    only with regard to human rights concerns but also in terms of our bilateral
                    relationship. But, the Embassy officially refused to accept our demarches. We
                    seemed to be in a stalemate. My supervisor at the time, the Deputy Office
                    Director Lynn Pascoe asked me whether my Russian was good enough to talk to the
                    guard at the Soviet Embassy. After I indicated that it was probably adequate, he
                    asked me to go to the Embassy that evening with a document in hand and
                    essentially insist on giving it to the guard. This, obviously, is not the way
                    demarches are normally delivered. However, I was told that since it was critical
                    that we deliver our message, if it required sliding it under the door, I should
                    do so. I'm sure I was on camera at the old Russian Embassy on 16th Street, where
                    a car dropped me off. After ringing the bell, I spoke with the night guard,
                    telling him I had to leave a document. He clearly did not know what to do with
                    it but eventually took the paper which basically outlined our position — our
                    insistence on interviewing the boy. In the end, they did grant us permission to
                    talk to him at Dulles Airport to ensure that he was returning to the Soviet
                    Union voluntarily. Who knows what he really wanted, but when our then Assistant
                    Secretary for European Affairs — the case had reached that level —Richard Burt
                    interviewed him, he said he wanted to go home.</p>

                        without question, of course you are going to let him, I mean, you know, you

                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: How to avoid the adverse publicity and the problem of public perception
                    that the U.S. Government was sending a kid back to “those commies”. It was still
                    the Cold War era after all, and official relations remained somewhat chilly.
                    There is a problem of the public at large saying by God, you are sending a kid
                    back to those communists. It was still a Cold War era.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: The Cuban kid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Cuban kid, where his father was in Cuba and wanted him
                        back and the kid was eight or nine years old and the Cuban American
                        community tried to turn him into a saint or something like that. At a
                        certain point you just realize this humanity and all this; unless you can
                        talk about being really an abusive thing and then you turn it over to the
                        authorities of the country. But it was tricky.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: It really was tricky. And, we were of more than two minds about what was
                    the best approach. From the standpoint of the family, it was best that the son
                    return to the Soviet Union with the family; moreover, as the son of a
                    high-ranking diplomat, he would probably not confront serious repercussions.
                    Undoubtedly, this whole episode had a negative impact on the father's subsequent
                    career. I don't think he secured any other high level postings abroad. Plus,
                    based on later reports, it seems the son had a difficult time readjusting to
                    life in his homeland. In the end, we were all of two or three minds as we
                    watched the kid board the plane and fly off to Moscow.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>But it was an interesting, albeit tense, . I stress this now because years later,
                    when I had a second stint on the Soviet Desk, the atmosphere was very different,
                    and the relationship had clearly improved between my first and second tours on
                    the Desk. One final aspect of my first such tour warrant mention, namely that I
                    somehow also had the role of “logistics” person in the office, and as such wound
                    up putting together a lot of the preparatory materials for a visit by Foreign
                    Minister Andrei Gromyko to Washington. Because of the heretofore icy relations
                    combined with factors such as the Soviets shooting down a KAL flight, there had
                    not been an “official” visit by the Soviet Foreign Minister to Washington in
                    years. So we had not “SOP” (standard operating procedures) for the Desk/European
                    Bureau should deal with the visit. So it fell to me to prepare a step-by-step
                    manual concerning who did what — who went to the airport, took part in events,
                    etc. Obviously, the Protocol Office had its own materials but this was in-house
                    for us. It turns out that my handiwork, this manual, was used by the Soviet Desk
                    for a number of subsequent high-ranking visits.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let us talk about the religious dissidents and all. Were
                        the Pentecostals still in the embassy at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Yes. There were still one or two Pentecostals living in the Embassy.
                    This had been a very hot issue for some time, but was starting to be less of a
                    point of contention by this time. Yet, the question of “what is to be done”
                    remained. The real issue then was how to assist genuine religious dissidents
                    while simultaneously preventing a horde of people from seeking refuge or camping
                    out in the Embassy basement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what- this '85, it was '83 to '85 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in the Soviet Union? I mean, how
                        would you describe relations at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Relations were cool (even icy at times) and references such as the “Evil
                    Empire” didn't help. At the same time, it was a period of flux, even
                    opportunity, wherein Foreign Service Officer, such as our Office Director Tom
                    Simons and the staff as a whole, looked for ways to melt the ice, if you will.
                    This set the stage for the “that” that would occur a few years late, with
                    Reagan-Gorbachev.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But Gorbachev- we were still going through the Andropov,
                        Chernenko; I mean, leaders were dying.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: That is right. What I mean by setting the stage is that there were
                    people in the U.G. Government focusing on how and when to get beyond the
                    horrible time when I said set the stage, there were people already thinking, in
                    the U.S. Government, about how and when and how to get beyond the seemingly
                    horrible relations of the day. And of course, arms control issues that were very
                    much uppermost in the minds of our leadership, as I am sure they were Soviet
                    priorities as well. Other hot button issues included the broad range of human
                    rights and dissident concerns, including a variety of non-religious dissident
                    cases, which I personally did not handle.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you get involved, I mean, was there sort of a
                        dissidence of religious- was there a Jewish cast to it or was this almost
                        separate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: That was basically separate. There was certainly a Jewish orientation in
                    the work of the office related to emigrants from the former Soviet union,
                    especially in the late 70s when many of the so-called Refuseniks were starting
                    to leave, but I was there only at the tail end of that migration. By the
                    early-to-mid 80s, we were focusing on more esoteric groups, whereas the Jewish
                    groups were already being cared for by a number of different Offices at State as
                    well as nongovernmental organizations. .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for the White House, the National
                        Security Council dealing with this? I mean, was there- was this still the
                        period where sort of President Reagan and his group, he came out of the
                        pretty far right of the Republican Party and obviously extremely suspicious
                        of the Soviet Union; was that still prevailing or were things beginning to
                        change? Did you get any feel for this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I definitely got the feeling that they were still very, very
                    conservative. But at the same time, folks on the Soviet Desk and elsewhere in
                    the bureaucracy were furiously writing all sorts of briefing papers and memos
                    aimed at chipping away at the ice and looking for ways to open up the dialog and
                    the minds of those in charge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when you are dealing with religion, did Islam,
                        ________________ of the Central Asian area and all, did that play any role
                        in what you were thinking at the time or was it pretty much-</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: To start with, there were several of us working on various aspects of
                    the dissidents issue. In general, we gave little thought at that point to
                    questions related to Islam. Later when I returned for a second tour on the
                    Soviet Desk, this was a much more significant variable. But that was later, and
                    while during this period there was an officer in our section that focused more
                    on regional minorities, I concentrated more on the Pentecostals and other
                    minority religious sects out in Siberia and the Far East. .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel a bit like the new kid on the block, being at
                        the Soviet- I mean, obviously you had had this background but at the same
                        time you would have had people who had been dealing with this their entire
                        careers and then all of a sudden you are plunked in there; how did you feel
                        about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: No, I never felt that on the Soviet Desk (SOV). SOV behaved very much as
                    a family and you really weren't included unless you more or less arrived with a
                    certain predisposition or educational background. Not that it was overly tight
                    or exclusive, but rather it tended to be self-selecting with most of the people
                    in the office having advanced degrees in either Russian history or politics, and
                    they all knew Russia. My background certainly fit the mold. There were
                    definitely people that had been working these issues for years but they did not
                    make one feel inadequate or inferior. That said, I recall early on attending a
                    Foreign Buildings Office (FBO) meeting where a big hulking guy briefed me about
                    building security in Moscow. I saw a look on his face that seemed to signify
                    “what is this young thing going to understand about building security, and why
                    on earth did they send her to me?” In turn, I became very determined to prove to
                    him that I could climb the scaffolding, if need be, when I visited the NOB and
                    that I could learn the vocabulary of the building trade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have, I mean, the fact that you came out of the
                        visa line into the Soviet- did you have a mentor or somebody who was, that
                        you felt was kind of, you know, plucked you out and looking after you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Yes, actually several people, one of which was someone who eventually
                    became my supervisor on the Soviet desk who has worked in this field and has a
                    fascinating story of how the Foreign Service works by the name of Jim
                    Schumaker.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: Jim is roughly my age. He entered the Foreign Service after college and
                    rose rapidly in the system. And after having served for twenty-something years
                    and reaches the senior rank of OC quite early confronts the situation of being
                    47 or 48 and not yet promoted from OC to MC in the requisite amount of time.
                    Having spent most of his career working on the former Soviet Union and Eastern
                    Europe, plus a tour in Afghanistan, he was clearly passionately committed to
                    working in the region. Yet, suddenly he was faced with being “ticked out”,
                    meaning too much time spent in a particular “grade”, before he was even 50.
                    Ironically, he was essentially willing to work for next to nothing, so committed
                    was he to the Foreign Service. But the Department really couldn't allow that.
                    Well, Jim demonstrated incredible ingenuity by simply re-taking the Foreign
                    Service Exam. He had already held a number of senior positions, including Deputy
                    Chief of Mission. Needless to say, he passed. When time came for his oral, half
                    the panel had to recuse themselves because they knew him. He passed the oral as
                    well. This created serious issues for the Department's personnel officers,
                    raising questions about what to do with him and whether to re-admit him into the
                    Foreign Service and at what rank. Eventually, they found a diplomatic solution,
                    allowing him to fill in as needed in the former Soviet world. For example, he
                    served as Acting Consul General in Vladivostok for some months during a staffing
                    gap. He filled in elsewhere — Moscow and Kiev — as well. Basically, he served as
                    a WAE without exactly being retired. .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: WAE is-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I am sorry. It means “when actually employed”.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is what we use retirees for to put them on part-time
                        work.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: That is right. I do not know what category they put him in but they used
                    his services for several years. Most recently he went to work for the OSCE
                    (Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe) back in Kiev, once again
                    working in the same general area. I go into all that because he is someone who
                    had been totally committed to first, the Foreign Service, and secondly to
                    serving in the area of the former Soviet Union. And he was the Section Chief for
                    the unit I worked in during my first tour in SOV. When a year into my tour there
                    was an announcement that Roz Ridgeway, who was to be the next Assistant
                    Secretary of State for Europe, was looking for a mid-level assistant, Jim, my
                    friend and mentor, recommended me because he thought I had the requisite skills.
                    I interviewed for that position and got it. And that certainly helped me obtain
                    other positions down the road. Tom Simons also was very helpful. In such a close
                    knit group, people were protective of their own and very helpful to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how long were you working with Roz Ridgeway?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: Originally, the assignment was supposed to last one year but it turned
                    into an 18-month tour. The standard length for such Special or Executive
                    Assistant positions was one year. But after I had been on the job a few months,
                    Ambassador Ridgway asked me to stay on a little longer because we had hardly
                    gotten into the swing of working together; so I did stay on, and it was a
                    fascinating experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about Roz Ridgway, whom I have interviewed? How
                        did you find her and her way of operating?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I liked her very much. She would be the first to admit that even having
                    been an ambassador twice and then an Assistant Secretary , she had never had a
                    female Special Assistant until then. And she once admitted to me the difficulty
                    of knowing exactly how to interact because at times, especially when we traveled
                    together, it was easy for her to simply regard me as a friend. At the same time,
                    however, she recognized that I was her staffer, and she was used to having men
                    as staffers, except in purely secretarial roles. So, she had to grapple with the
                    gender issue as well.</p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I imagine there was a certain ambivalence on her part towards the
                    situation. I remember once during one of our trips to Europe we wound up going
                    to dinner and having a very open and personal conversation. I suspect that she
                    might well have later thought that this wasn't an appropriate interaction with a
                    staffer. She was a bit more distant subsequently. So, there was a bit of
                    “push-pull” that way, but the relationship was certainly amicable and an
                    wonderful learning experience for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. What were some of the things you were seeing being
                        done during this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Well, this was the start of the budding Reagan/Gorbachev relationship to
                    be sure, but there were many factors that led to this, including some negative
                    developments, such as the mistreatment of the American journalist Danilov in
                    Moscow and continuing problems related to the whole arms race. But on the
                    personal front, from the outset we had to figure out exactly what my role in the
                    Front Office was to be. The Assistant Secretary herself was brand knew, and
                    initially it was far from clear what I would be doing. Over time, I became
                    essentially a clearinghouse for papers that were passed to the Staff Assistants
                    and intended for her — the doorkeeper of sorts, but there was also a secretary
                    to do that. Some parts of my work were substantive but much of it was in that
                    gray zone, and I lacked a clearly defined portfolio of my own. I attended many
                    meetings and got to hear the views of both the Assistant Secretary and her
                    interlocutors and in turn acquire a better grasp of our own policies. But, I
                    have to admit, I had lots of questions regarding whether I had a real role or
                    was simply moving papers around. In other words, did I have any significant
                    contribution to make? Not really, but then again, that is the way a Special or
                    Executive Assistant is supposed to function.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you are the fly on the wall.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: The fly on the wall that hears and learns a lot. And in that period our
                    relationship with the Soviet Union shifted from being one might say fairly dark
                    to considerably lighter. But from my perspective one of the most interesting
                    aspects of the job related to travel because when the Assistant Secretary
                    traveled, I traveled as well. When Secretary Shultz traveled to Europe, so did
                    Ridgway, and therefore, so did I. And when it came time for the G-8, which
                    happened to be in Tokyo that year, Shultz traveled to Japan, and she went along
                    , as did I. There were definitely some fantastic trips and the opportunity to
                    witness the dynamics among the key players. As you well know, George Shultz was
                    very well respected by members of the Foreign Service for many reasons, not the
                    least of which was his manner of dealing with subordinates, especially when
                    compared to some of his predecessors and successors. Several examples come to
                    mind. While I was still on the Soviet Desk, Office Director Tom Simons invited
                    him to our Christmas party, an event that was actually renown in the building
                    for having caviar. Apparently, none of the working level offices had up to that
                    point ever invited him to such a party; yet he came. Flying on the Secretary's
                    plane was also interesting. On each flight he would make a point of walking down
                    the aisle and talking to everyone at least briefly. There was someone on his
                    staff who seemed to keep track of the birthdays of members of the traveling
                    party and advise him according so that he could acknowledge the person. It
                    happened to me once during a trip to Athens. We were all at some reception and
                    at some point he came over to me and said “I understand you have a big day
                    today.” These little touches were endearing and much appreciated particularly in
                    a bureaucratic environment where such gestures tend to be infrequent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of all the secretaries of state, both in the substantive
                        and on the personal level, George Shultz really stands preeminent.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I think that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Colin Powell on the personal level was great, policy

                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: That too. Back to the earlier period. It was very interesting to work
                    closely with the Secretary's staff (the so-called S Staff) and be at least on
                    the periphery of a wide range of important meetings — some of which were tense
                    or difficult. And there was a period in which Roz Ridgway herself was the center
                    of discussions concerning whether or not a woman might know anything about
                    “throw weight” and should have any real role in arms control negotiations. And
                    that attitude still exists — so the gender issue rears its head in many
                    different ways.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I know. It was something she said she very much enjoyed. I don't recall
                    the specifics but I think she may have met her Coast Guard husband in the “fish
                    world”.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there when- did you go on the, when Ronald Reagan
                        went to Berlin and said tear down the wall, Mr. Gorbachev, and all

                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I was not, for reasons that I can no longer remember — there were a few
                    trips in which the plane was “too full” and some staffers didn't make it. That
                    may have been one of those times. Frankly, what saddened me is that considering
                    all the trips I did go on, the one that I could not make at the last moment due
                    to space limitations was Reykjavik. And I really wanted to, as did all the staff
                    at that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, as part of the SOV club, were you finding this a
                        very exciting time? Because things seemed to be melting quite rapidly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Yes, it truly was. Your mentioning the SOV Club is an apt description
                    which reminds me that in the EUR Bureau there was another important office
                    called RPM (Regional Political Military Affairs) and there was considerable
                    rivalry or competition between SOV and RPM on policy issues and approaches
                    related to arms control and dealing with the Soviet Union in general. One of the
                    things that struck me most while working for Roz Ridgeway and seeing the papers
                    produced (briefing materials, memos, etc) by these two offices was how in a
                    funny way the two offices resembled two different types of beauties, namely
                    Grace Kelly and Sophia Loren.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking about two mammoth movie stars of an earlier
                        period, Sophia Loren being sort of a very earthy and Grace Kelly being ice
                        princess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: That is right. Grace Kelly's slip never showed, and RPM was the Grace
                    Kelly of the Bureau. RPM papers were always letter perfect — never a typo and
                    the format was always correct. The Soviet Desk on the other hand — and I have to
                    admit to a bit of partiality here — did not always have its “paper act” all
                    together. Not that Sophia Loren was slovenly, but figuratively speaking her slip
                    sometimes would show, and yet she was quite impressive, and at her best,
                    outstanding. That was what always struck me about the work produced by those two
                    offices; both were excellent but the Soviet desk would come in with a true tour
                    de force production every once in awhile.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you sort of personally subscribe to Gorbachev as
                        a new look or- there was one of skepticism; how did you feel about
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I think there was a very strong desire to want all this — note the
                    caveats — and him to be the genuine article. But at the same time, what did the
                    “genuine article” mean? The genuine article as a Soviet reformer; yes, we
                    thought he really was that. Whether he was going to emerge as our image of an
                    honest-to-God democrat, on that there were widely differing views. After all, he
                    did come up through the Soviet system, and that certainly left its mark, but how
                    much so was unclear. .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you pick up on the part of Ridgeway or others or even
                        yourself, you know, a bit of nervousness about Ronald Reagan, that he might
                        get overly enthusiastic about Gorbachev? You know, I mean, you are sort of
                        the handlers and your principle might get too far off the reservation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Well, you have to understand that no one wanted to be mistaken for a
                    Pollyanna or jeopardize U.S. interests. But relations had been bad for so long
                    that we were caught up in the hope for real improvements. Things evolve;
                    circumstances and attitudes change but certainly at that moment we hoped for the
                    best. Of course, there was the concern that if we were overly optimistic or
                    enthusiastic, at the first setback, when something went wrong, there might be a
                    tendency for the pendulum to swing to the other extreme. There was that concern;
                    yet, overall, we were cautiously optimistic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was RPM a brake on this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Probably. You know, it is really hard after all these years to recall
                    exactly who was for what and when but let's say RPM was more focused on the nuts
                    and bolts, the military and nuclear hardware available and what we did or did
                    not need, as were other government agencies. Certainly, they concentrated more
                    on weaponry and broader political-military issues. That said, I don't want to
                    make it sound as though SOV or any other office consisted of misguided
                    optimists, not at all — simply that their orientations were a bit different.
                    different.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I think, and I was hardly alone in this view, there were many who knew
                    what did and did not work in the Soviet Union and why. They were learning about
                    causes — some of which pre-dated the Soviet regime, going back to much earlier
                    periods of Russian history, with its two-class society. Fundamentally, there has
                    always been an elite with lots of intelligence, capacity, and creativity, with
                    scientists who could come un with brilliant ways to patch things together with
                    the proverbial band-aid. And we also had a fairly good sense of how the system
                    did not work, which made it possible to suspend disbelief in a way, regarding
                    the point that you made. In other words, recognizing failures in the system,
                    were we, nonetheless, allowing them to act as a threat. We might be seeing
                    parallels in North Korea with a leader sacrificing his people for specific
                    military-related goals. That, too, was an image many had regarding the Soviet
                    Union, namely that they might starve the masses if necessary to build the
                    perfect rocket. It obviously took some time to grasp that they might not be
                    doing as much as some thought in the sphere of military/nuclear technology
                    development. Similar assumptions came to the fore in assessments about Saddam
                    Hussein and what he was up to, and tended to drive policy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was anybody, you know, during this time on the Soviet

                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Let me jump ahead a few years. In August 1991, I was returning from a
                    sunshine tour in the Caribbean for my second stint on the Soviet desk and I
                    remember thinking how different was the bilateral relationship I was coming back
                    to and how much better, calmer our relationship with the Soviet Union was the
                    “second time around”. And I recall turning on the television in the hotel I
                    where I was temporarily staying, and was shocked to see pictures of tanks in
                    Moscow, with shots of Boris Yeltsin in the thick of it, and everything seemed to
                    be falling apart. That was my first day back. I immediately went to work, and
                    for the next week or so it seemed as though we were working around the clock.
                    What was patently obvious was that other agencies seemingly had not prepared
                    scenarios for this type situation, the “dismemberment” or collapse of the Soviet
                    Union we were witnessing. One would have thought that analysts might in prior
                    years (before 1991) have at least prepared some contingency papers along the
                    lines of what actually transpired, but they provide very little along these
                    lines. We had to come up with our own scenarios for what might happen next. We
                    wound up doing our own analysis, there on the Soviet Desk, with minimal input
                    from other agencies.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, we are talking about the CIA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Basically but it is a general observation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is far enough back and also, you know, we are not
                        talking about methods or anything else; I mean, we can talk about the

                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: The analysis was absent, which was quite surprising, even shocking given
                    the large analytical staff devoted to that part of the world. Yet, in that
                    period at least, they really did not come up with much that was coherent or of
                    value to policy makers. So, during the next few weeks we churned out a myriad
                    position papers dealing with the “what ifs”: the what if this happened or that
                    occurred — scenarios one, two, three, etc.</p>

                <p>TONGOUR: Oh, I had what was called a bridge assignment lasting three or four
                    months because my next assignment began in May. From February to May, I worked
                    for the Board of Examiners.</p>

                <p>Today is the 8th of February, 2008. Nadia, you wanted to talk a bit about the
                    atmosphere and all when you were in- where were you?</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: Last time we spoke about my work on the Soviet Desk and then as a
                    Special Assistant for Roz Ridgway. I subsequently thought a bit about our prior
                    conversation and realized that there are a various aspects of our past
                    relationship with the soviet Union that are now virtually forgotten, one of
                    which was that during that period we monitored very closely the movements and
                    travel of Soviet diplomats in the United States, and they, likewise, monitored
                    the movements of our personnel in the Soviet Union. What is now often forgotten
                    was the so-called “25 mile rule” which meant that if a Soviet diplomat assigned
                    to New York or Washington wanted to visit Williamsburg or travel to Trenton, New
                    Jersey or anywhere further than 25 miles from their mission, they would have to
                    seek permission officially from us. Often, depending on their treatment of our
                    folks in Moscow, permission might be denied. There was a great deal of back and
                    forth negotiations between the two sides concerning who could travel where, but
                    that was merely the tip of the iceberg. We had conflicts over the most minute of
                    issues or simply put over minutia. For example, the Soviet Mission in New York
                    owned a “dacha”, a country house, in Long Island, just as we had one outside of
                    Moscow. Theirs was in the town of Glen Cove, New York. In a fit of patriotic
                    fervor, the community of Glen Cove wanted to keep the Russians from using the
                    local beach, which created a bit of, you could say, a scandal, with the Russians
                    feeling very hard pressed at not being allowed to use the facilities near their
                    dacha and the citizens of Glen Cove adamant about keeping the “commies” from the
                    beach. I go into all this just to show that there were many such points of
                    friction, not all of which dealt with nuclear arms or substantive policy issues.
                    One that wound up taking up considerable time and energy was whether or not we
                    could build a new Consulate in Kiev (then still part of the Soviet Union) and
                    they in turn could build one in New York City. Such disputes were part of the
                    overall bilateral environment. .</p>
                <p>One last point to mention about that era deals with the visit of Foreign Minister
                    Andrei Gromyko. We talked briefly about this earlier and I may have misspoke in
                    talking about this having been a first visit to Washington in years. In fact, he
                    hadn't been here for some time, but for an interesting reason. He had apparently
                    planned to come in 1983 but that visit was aborted after the Soviets shot down a
                    Korean Airline flight (KAL) which had strayed over Soviet territory.</p>

                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: That is right. Thereafter, there was such an uproar and so much negative
                    sentiment and publicity about the Soviet action that Gromyko cancelled his then
                    anticipated trip to New York for the fall session of the UN General Assembly. A
                    year later there was a desire to ameliorate the situation and improve relations,
                    at least slightly, and the idea emerged for him to combine a visit to Washington
                    with his expected trip to New York. At that point, there was some concern over
                    whether even a stop in New York would prove feasible for reasons that were quite
                    bureaucratic. The Metropolitan Airport Authority of New York did not want to
                    facilitate the landing of the Foreign Minister's plane. Likewise, The
                    metropolitan area police did not want to provide the requisite additional
                    security and on. For several weeks leading up to the visit, my job was to
                    interact with various city and state authorities to persuade them to allow the
                    plane to land and authorize the purchase of fuel without advance payment. Every
                    obstacle imaginable was created to prevent this a visit. In the end, we
                    succeeded, and my personal accomplishment was, as I mentioned, to put together a
                    manual, a standard operating procedures report, on how to handle visits of
                    leaders from “less than friendly” states, essentially how to get them through
                    customs, so to speak, without a crisis. I felt it to be a worthy enterprise.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you talk to the police, the airport authorities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were they, I mean, what was their feeling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Hostility, even some rage, probably a less intense version of post 9/11
                    reactions. Soviet officials were regarded as the people who shot down an
                    innocent passenger flight, and local authorities were not about to facilitate a
                    visit by the leaders of the “evil empire”. They were “righteously indignant” and
                    saw no reason to help.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find yourself portrayed as one of these
                        State Department wimps who were-?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Probably. I hesitate to say this because we no longer used terms such as
                    charming in describing women in EERs but some of my bosses referred to me as
                    very personable and this may have been a factor in my dealings with them. In any
                    case, some effort was required to win them over and make them realize we were
                    not just wimps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Well, we come to 1987 and you had a rather short
                        term but interesting one with the Board of Examiners. What were you doing
                        and how did it operate and what were your impressions?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: I have been thinking about this quite a bit lately because I may be
                    doing a stint on the Board of Examiners again in the near future as a WAE (a
                    part-time position for retirees). Consequently, I have been thinking about how
                    the whole testing system has changed in recent years. In the mid-late '80s, it
                    was already quite different from when I entered the Foreign Service. For
                    example, in 1987, we did not inform applicants taking the oral exam whether or
                    not they had passed on that day. Years before and subsequently, applicants would
                    be informed of their results at the end of the day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was with the Board of Examiners in the mid '70s and we
                        used to tell people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: As it worked in 1987, a person would take the written exam, fill out
                    what seemed a forest of forms, and then wait to be invited for an oral
                    assessment either in Washington or in a major regional center. Examiners would
                    travel to the various cities to administer the exam. I personally went for two
                    to three weeks each to San Francisco, to Dallas and to Boston, and it was
                    delightful being able to spend time in these different areas. We worked as a
                    team of four and we examined applicants for a full day. I'm sure this has
                    changed somewhat but then we spent the mornings questioning the applicants (the
                    actual oral exam), followed by an “in-box” and writing exercise. The afternoon
                    was devoted to the negotiating exercise, which was fascinating both for its
                    content and the varied responses of the applicants to the assignment. Normally,
                    if one of us interviewed an applicant in the morning, she would simply observe,
                    rather than evaluate, that applicant in the afternoon. Essentially four separate
                    examiners would rate each individual — two in the morning and two in the
                    afternoon. s.</p>
                <p>Afterwards, the team would get together and evaluate each applicant, rating them
                    on 16 different attributes — qualities such as judgment, oral and written
                    expression, initiative, cultural sensitivity, interpersonal skills and so on.
                    What we often found — I suspect this is still true — was that a person who might
                    have been outstanding in answering questions about American culture to a foreign
                    contact might not necessarily do as well in the negotiating exercise. Certain
                    individuals stand out even after so many years. I remember a young woman who was
                    a truly outstanding applicant in her morning interview but barely spoke in the
                    afternoon session; instead, she constantly “deferred” to the young man seated
                    next to her. On the other hand, there was always someone who probably assumed he
                    had done a brilliant job by “winning all the goodies” for himself in the
                    negotiation exercise only to fail because he really hadn't negotiated but rather
                    foisted his will on his colleagues. A fascinating process.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>It's probably worth mentioning how far the State Department has come in certain
                    areas because in addition to the examiners, there were review panels in
                    Washington that read the full files successful applicants for suitability. Thus,
                    for example, if I had examined you, I would not be able to read your file;
                    however those reading your file would learn a great deal, not only about your
                    scores and security clearance information, but also your biographical data and
                    views on entering the Foreign Service, etc. Towards the end of the overall
                    process, four individuals who had read these files would also rate them. The
                    reason I mention the significant changes since then has to do with shifting
                    attitudes towards gays in the Service. There was one case I subsequently
                    wondered about of a young man who in many respects was a perfect applicant. His
                    academic work, test scores, life experience — were all geared toward a career at
                    State. However, in the course of his security clearance interviews it came out
                    that he was gay, and there were associated problems. First, he admitted that
                    everyone significant in his life knew of his orientation except his mother, but
                    he vowed to tell her at the first appropriate moment. Secondly, it emerged that
                    during a brief period in college he had had a bit of a drinking problem, but
                    that was no longer an issue. I don't want to belabor this, except to say I
                    ultimately concluded that this young man was not really blackmailable (assuming
                    he would tell his mother, etc.). Given all his positive attributes, I voted for
                    his admission, but I was the only one. My colleagues did not agree and deemed
                    him “unsuitable”. I'm telling all this to show just how different it is today.
                    Now there is apparently an active gay and lesbian organization within the
                    Department and members of my own retirement class, including a former ambassador
                    openly acknowledge they are gay. This did not happen overnight but certainly
                    during the last decade and a half there has been a widening or opening of the
                    Department's doors to more diverse applicants.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get an impression of, you went to a couple of
                        places that I would think that San Francisco but particularly Boston you
                        would find a particularly high rate of passes or more eligible than you
                        would say in Dallas, but did you find this true or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: Not as much as you would think because of the reason we previously
                    discussed regarding the negotiating exercise and manifestations of interpersonal
                    skills. Of course in terms of the educational level, this may have ben true, but
                    I think this was probably a transitional period in terms of movement from the
                    traditional Foreign Service with its emphasis on an Ivy League education, where
                    applicants were judged more on their intellectual acumen than their practical
                    skills, to the current, more mixed system, which tends to frown a bit on the
                    more elitist prior system. When I was on the Board of Examiners, it was more of
                    a combination of how well one thinks on his feet, degree of common sense and
                    ability to handle problematical situations plus, of course, your general
                    knowledge. Students from the Ivy League schools did not necessarily have an
                    advantage in describing how they would handle a consular crisis in the middle of
                    Africa. Probably, the sharpest kid I encountered — and subsequently wondered
                    about — was interviewed in Dallas. He walked in with cowboy boots and jeans, and
                    I frankly wondered how he would manage. He was young, just out of college, and
                    brilliant but it was unclear to me whether he would fit into the culture of the
                    State Department. To conclude, though, there may have been a bit of an
                    expectation that the cream of the crop might come out of Boston or D.C. but it
                    was not pronounced.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I know when I did it I spent three weeks in San
                        Francisco and I thought oh boy, you know, we are going to get the Stanfords,
                        the Berkeleys and all; we did great. You know, they did much worse in
                        Washington and we were really pushing. I came back with a feeling, and I
                        have lived in California for many years, I came back with a feeling that
                        people who went there, you know, lost a few IQ points for just- by lolling
                        around in the sun or something like that. I do not know; I did not go in
                        with that but I came back with that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Well, I had that attitude too when I first went to graduate school in
                    California and saw a lot of people sprawled on the grass in front of one of
                    Stanford's libraries. I wondered how anyone got any work done, but they — and I
                    eventually — did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well anyway, what was your impression of how women were
                        treated at this particular point in time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I think much better than they had been 10 years earlier when I took the
                    exam, and the Department had come some distance already by then. There were
                    certainly fewer, if any, questions that could be regarded as gender based. But
                    as I mentioned there were still too many cases of “reticent” females in the
                    group negotiation exercise. Many still tended to appear more comfortable when
                    asked to talk about cultural or political development than when in the fray.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have interviewed people who said that at one point, this
                        goes way back, but they were interviewed, when they were told no, they did
                        not pass but they hoped that maybe she could marry a nice Foreign Service
                        officer because she would make a wonderful Foreign Service wife.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I think I mentioned that when I took the exam first right out of college
                    I certainly experienced this attitude but by the time I entered, the situation
                    had changed. Still, some of the security guys who did the background check on me
                    seemed more resistant to the changing times. One security officer interviewed a
                    longstanding boyfriends of mine and according to him was asked why he didn't
                    marry me and save me from “this life”. It seems the security officer still
                    believed it would be better for me to stay home. And he was not alone in this
                    regard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure. I know, and this is the thing that we are talking
                        about. Well, I mean, this reflects American life, too; things have changed
                        tremendously in the, well, in just the last few decades as far as the gay or
                        homosexual side, the gender side, the race side and all that. I mean,
                        things-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>When you were in San Francisco did you- were there any Asian applicants? Because
                    this is not a pool that we have been getting many people from.</p>
                <p>TONGOUR: It was so long ago that I don't really remember. More to the point, I
                    don't recall thinking what a lot of Asia applicants, particularly since we were
                    carrying out the interviews in downtown San Francisco where there were many
                    Asian-Americans. So while there were undoubtedly a few, not too many.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Eighty-seven, you are still- where did you go after
                        this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: After that I started a regular assignment in one of my favorite jobs of
                    my career. I was the Desk Officer for Hungary and the Baltic States. This was an
                    odd combination, but it happened because no one was sure where to assign the
                    Baltic Republics in our bureaucratic structure. This was after all still the
                    Soviet era, and as a matter of principle or policy, we would not officially
                    recognize the Soviet occupation of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That has been going on since '45.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: That is right. We had a rather unusual situation. On the one hand, we
                    accepted the fact that people had to obtain visas from the Soviet Embassy to
                    travel to this region. On the other, we nominally at least recognized the three
                    charg�s based in their missions here. Actually, only two of them were in
                    Washington; the Estonian representative operated out of New York. At this point,
                    these gentlemen were elderly, with the Estonia Charg� well into his 80s. He had
                    left Estonia in the inter-war period (between World War I and II) and had never
                    been back. In essence, we did not know where to place them in our office
                    structure. Who would be the responsible desk officer? Heretofore, Hungary had
                    been a fairly quiet “account” for many years. As much out of tradition as
                    anything else, the officer handling Hungarian affairs wound up being the desk
                    officer for the three Baltic Republics as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were doing this from '87 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: It should have been a full two year tour but in those days the
                    Department was very strict about the so-called “five year rule”. The Personnel
                    Office was particularly vigilant in thwarting the European Bureau's frequent
                    efforts to get around the rules.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you explain what the five year rule?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: The five year rule concerned the length of time one could remain in
                    Washington before having to serve overseas. Unless one had an assignment deemed
                    truly vital to the national interest, one was obliged to go abroad after five
                    years. In many instances, individuals obtained waivers to the rule, but the
                    European Bureau (EUR) had had a lengthy track record of trying to get around
                    this rule; consequently, when I obtained this assignment, the personnel system
                    mandated that it would be only a one year tour rather than the normal two. We
                    hope we could change this in the course of the year, but our efforts failed.
                    Still, it was a wonderful assignment for several reasons. One was the excitement
                    of working on an account that was quite active.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>Starting roughly in that period, there was a great deal of interest in the Baltic
                    Republics. There was a lively young Baltic American community as well as an
                    emerging activism among the young in the Baltics who were pressuring the State
                    Department to act, to do more than simply issue statements once a year on
                    Captive Nations Day, something I would draft as part of the job. The Hungary
                    portfolio was also fascinating because it was a time when things were starting
                    to loosen or open up in the Soviet Union but even more noticeably in Eastern
                    Europe. The Hungarians were discreet but they were moving; there was great
                    accessibility for our people in Budapest as well as in terms of our contacts
                    with their diplomats here in Washington. I had, for example, an excellent
                    relationship with the DCM at the Hungarian Embassy. The reason this was one of
                    my best jobs is that the Department sometimes provides great opportunities for
                    mid-level officers if they happen to work on a country that is interesting but
                    not on the first tier of interest because in such positions they can actually
                    contribute a great deal to policy formulation. People maybe focusing on other
                    issues while your memos get signed and move up the chain of command. And you may
                    well be creating policy. I say this slightly tongue in cheek but it was a
                    vibrant time and rewarding experience. We also had a very active ambassador
                    there, Mark Palmer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I have interviewed Mark.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Mark was excellent in many, many respects, and in particular, he was
                    very good at bringing people together. I'm sure he still is, from what I
                    understand.. In Hungary; he entertained a great deal and would invite different
                    types of people to his residence, effectively mixing them with varied groups of
                    Embassy personnel. There was a lot of outreach and a big push on expanding
                    student visitor and exchange program, developing a graduate management program —
                    essentially a business school in Budapest — and other people-to-people
                    activities. Moreover, a prominent Washington socialite named Esther Coopersmith
                    was a friend of Ambassador Palmer's, and she would on occasion bring together
                    all kinds of folks who were interested in Hungary. This was also the period in
                    which we returned the Crown of St. Stephen, an important symbol in Hungarian
                    history, which the Americans had kept since the end of World War II. This
                    prompted considerable good feeling in Budapest, as did our hosting the Hungarian
                    Premier towards the end of my tour.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was the government, from our perspective, what
                        was the situation in Hungary in the government there at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: What was most notable was the fact that the Hungarians had been moving
                    actively to liberalize their economy, not unlike what we've seen happen in
                    China. Officially they were not changing much on the political side, officially,
                    but they were, in fact, liberalizing after a fashion and providing opportunities
                    for private enterprise. Hungarian officials wanted to join OPIC (Overseas
                    Private Investment Corporation) and made it clear they wanted more trade with
                    the West as well as greater economic interaction in general. At the same time
                    they were permitting greater independence in the area of local elections. The
                    Premier's visit to Washington was really a “big deal” for the Hungarians, since
                    this was the first such official visit. I wound up working on that visit just
                    before I left the position in the summer of 1988.</p>
                <p>Moreover, I should point out that our Hungarian contacts were openly voicing
                    expressions of Hungarian nationalism. Not that they had not been nationalistic
                    before, but now it was something more openly discussed. For example, the
                    Hungarian DCM, who later became Hungarian Ambassador in several countries,
                    actively reached out to the Department and openly discussed Hungarian national
                    aspirations — as distinct from its membership in the Warsaw Pact. I recall an
                    instance in which he somewhat wistfully compared Finland and Hungary, with their
                    similar linguistic roots and more or less equal economic level before World War
                    II, and noting how far Finland had progressed since then He even joked about one
                    day re-creating recreating a Danubian Federation in which Hungary and Austria
                    could be reunited. He clearly did not suffer as a result of his reaching out to
                    the Department or for making these types of comments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, we are talking about when you are on the cusp
                        of...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: ...Yes there was definitely an awareness of the possibility of
                    change.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a pressure group particularly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Not compared to the Baltic Americas on the Baltic front. There was
                    enthusiasm for the old homeland, but not real pressure, other than in the sense
                    of how can we do more to further economic ties and business relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about leader grants and students? Were they coming
                        through?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I don't recall the numbers exactly but we seem to have had something on
                    the order of 300 or so, which was a dramatic increase from zero. These USIS
                    -sponsored grants definitely were important. During trips to the region, when I
                    visited Budapest, I also traveled to Romania because I was the back-up officer
                    for that country, and the contrast between the two was amazing — making the
                    positive developments in Hungary seem all the more impressive. Change was
                    clearly visible in Hungary during that period. This was less true for
                    Romania.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this was at the height of Ceausescu.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: It was appalling on several levels, especially the fear factor. I took
                    the train from Budapest to Bucharest and many colleagues told me I was crazy to
                    do this because the secret people would be watching me all the time.
                    Nevertheless, I took the train and there was a gentleman in my compartment who
                    seemed terrified because he was transporting a three-volume, recently published
                    Hungarian history of Transylvania, which was essentially contraband. He was an
                    ethnic Hungarian who lived in Transylvania and had been in Hungary to perform in
                    a concert. When we got to the border and the customs or border police really
                    ransacked various compartments. They inspected our compartment and were
                    obviously not happy that I had a diplomatic passport and they could not,
                    therefore, examine my bags. They did go through the other passengers belongings
                    but did not succeed in finding the books, which I found interesting. My
                    “companion” was clearly relieved after that and became quite expansive, drinking
                    heavily and telling stories. But, yes, the atmosphere in Bucharest was grim and
                    the Romanian secret police presence was all pervasive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By this time what were sort of the policing, secret
                        policing situation in Hungary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Unclear, but certainly not as obvious. I am sure the secret police still
                    existed — they didn't just disappear over night — but they were less visible.
                    The Hungarians pride themselves or rather consider themselves the smartest
                    people in Europe. They joke that if you can learn their language, that in itself
                    is a mark of a high IQ. They were certainly more discreet and did not make their
                    surveillance of visitors obvious.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let us turn to the Baltics. In the first place, you
                        have this peculiar situation. I mean, did these little embassies or
                        legations, I guess they were, did they play any role at all other than just
                        an oddity in the history books or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: In one sense they did, at least during this period. There were several
                    factors involved, and one of these was financial, specifically the question of
                    how to allocate or dispose of money that had belonged to these legations before
                    the World War II. I no longer remember the details but somehow the Latvians
                    managed to get gold out of the country and into a Swiss account. As a result,
                    Latvian mission legation had a greater degree of wealth than the other two;
                    however, there was some sort of stipulation that the Latvian legation would
                    provide funds for the hard-pressed Estonians, not as a gift but as a sort of
                    loan. At the juncture, Estonian legation was broke and needed this financial
                    support. Yet, there were all sorts of complications stemming from the fact that
                    the funds were in Switzerland, requiring a formal transfer from the Latvian
                    account to Estonian hands, which someone had to sign for, raising again the
                    question of who had the requisite . It was a highly complex situation, and my
                    role was basically to ensure that this transfer was handled properly. And, of
                    course, there was the unfortunate and inevitable issue of national pride and
                    obvious discomfort for the Estonian Charg� who basically had to be support by
                    one of his neighbors. Now, that was on one hand.</p>
                <p>On the other, there was in this period a deportation case in which a Lithuanian
                    (or possibly Latvian, I no longer recall) , who had been in the U.S. for many
                    years, was to be deported for his role as a concentration camp guard during the
                    war. The case again focused attention on what could be described as the history
                    of anti-Semitism in the Baltic region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Baltic Republics, along with the Poles did not have a
                        clean record on anti-Semitism.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: That was truce for much of Eastern and Central Europe. This episode
                    highlighted the fact that while we were supporting these small “captive nations”
                    on the one hand, they were not “totally pure” on the other. So this was yet
                    another angle affecting our policy. .</p>
                <p>There also happened to be several people working at the National Security Council
                    (NSC) who were Baltic-Americans, not to mention a growing number of
                    Baltic-American activists in general — some of whom wound up in responsible
                    government positions in the Baltic countries after the fall of the Soviet Union.
                    There also were people, interestingly enough, who were not of Baltic extraction
                    but who for one reason or another were sympathetic to their cause and ,
                    empathetic and became involved in helping them out. For example, I had a friend
                    in New York, a lawyer, who helped the Estonian government draft its new
                    constitution after independence, and promoted all sorts of exchange programs for
                    Estonian students, initially using his own personal resources. This was just one
                    case but there were others helping as well..</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>And then, too, you had various noteworthy developments within the expat
                    community. The Estonians retained their Charg�, who was then 88 or 89 years old,
                    until he died. But in the case of the Lithuanians and the Latvians and
                    especially the latter, there was a changing of the guard. The process of
                    selection was quite interesting. Essentially, the Latvians in exile picked a
                    younger person — in his 50s or 60s — not 80s — someone from within their own
                    ranks to be in charge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much dealings with these exile
                        legations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Yes. They would visit. Each legation was quite small, with only one or
                    two persons at each. Still, they hosted representational events at their
                    residences, which doubled as their Chancery. They would also, as I mentioned,
                    call on the State Department to seek assistance on a variety of matters and if
                    the Soviets committed some egregious deed, they shared the information with us.
                    Above all, they simply wanted to be reassured of our interest and good will. So
                    they came fairly often. .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In both your responsibilities, Baltic and Hungarian, were
                        they exhibiting any signs of the new world is about to dawn?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: The Hungarians were definitely exhibiting signs that a new world was
                    dawning. They were ready, psychologically. Then, too, during my various visits
                    to Budapest, I met a number of impressive young staff in their Foreign Ministry
                    and other government offices, who are now the generation in charge. Hungary
                    already had an emerging crop of young leaders who were well educated and who
                    generally spoke English beautifully. They were primed for change, and they were
                    not eastward looking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was George Soros at all a factor? He was Hungarian, was he
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Yes, indeed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might explain who he is and he has been, particularly
                        since the break up of the Soviet Union a major player but how about during
                        this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: A multi-millionaire, financier, Soros established his own foundation to
                    provide assistance to Eastern Europe (starting with Hungary) and later the
                    former Soviet Union in the spheres of educational, and economic and democracy
                    promotion, to name but a few. But this was just the beginning. An interesting
                    example comes to mind. Indiana University had scheduled a conference on Hungary
                    in October 1987, the date that would come to be known as “Black Thursday” due to
                    the stock market crash of that day. The actual theme of the conference dealt
                    with the economic and political development of Hungary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the University of Indiana, of course, has probably the
                        preeminent Eastern European capacity programs and all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Yes. They sponsored the event and had invited George Soros to be the
                    keynote speaker. A memorable incident occurred when the conference organizer,
                    who was sorely lacking in tact, began his introduction of Soros by saying that
                    he was both happy and surprised to see him in view of the fact that Soros' stock
                    portfolio had just lost millions in value. He kept talking about how Soros'
                    stocks had plummeted, suffering a $30 to $40 million loss. After the host had
                    once again reiterated how awful it must have been to lose so much money, Soros
                    replied that in the first instance Hungary was so important to him that he would
                    have come even if he had lost it. Secondly, he said, while it was never fun to
                    lose that kind of money, having it to lose was not bad. Then, turning to topic
                    of Hungary, he emphasized the need to help and to focus on the future of
                    Hungary. As you know, eventually, Soros would turn his attention to all of
                    Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, but at that time he was already
                    focusing on various types of assistance and programs for Hungary. In fact, he
                    was very interested in the idea of promoting a business school then in the
                    planning stage, known informally as the Hungarian Management School in Budapest.

                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Team. Yes. You have to understand, at that time the Soviet Desk (SOV)
                    and the East European desks worked very closely together, and they both reported
                    to the same Deputy Assistant Secretary, who at the time happened to be Tom
                    Simons, my former Office Director in SOV, who had a strong interest in the
                    entire region, having served in Moscow, Bucharest, where he had been DCM, and
                    later Ambassador to Poland. So he saw it all as part of a larger domain and one
                    was not “disenfranchised” for working on one set of issues or region versus
                    another other.</p>

                        could not go to the Baltic States, under our rules, but we had officers, I
                        think, I guess out of Leningrad went there. What were you getting from
                        them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Quite honestly, I have to say that my assignment on the Desk was too
                    short to get a whole lot. I suspect they were too busy covering the Consular
                    District as a whole to get to the Baltic Republics very often. Probably,
                    Washington was more focused on the situation in the Baltic region than the
                    officers were at post. Then again that made sense inasmuch as we had all these
                    activist Baltic-Americans as well as the NSC stirring up the pot.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Whatever they may have felt privately, they were singing off the same
                    hymnal for our purposes — except, perhaps for the issue of money. There may have
                    been some slight tension over who was funding whom or a bit of sibling rivalry
                    over which mission might be getting more attention from us. Basically, they all
                    saw themselves as captive nations, both desirous of our continuing support and
                    grateful for whatever help we could provide.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Not to be overly cynical, we were all quite aware of the reality that
                    anyone wishing to travel to Riga had to obtain a Soviet visa. So we weren't
                    focusing on this possibility notwithstanding our own rhetoric, and
                    notwithstanding our hopes for the future; in fact, when that day actually came
                    we were “underwhelmingly” unprepared. I mean, we did not really have a game plan
                    for what to do the day after, when these nations were no longer “captive”.</p>

                        cataclysmic event, which was the break up of the Soviet Union, happened and
                        nobody was- not only that, calling it but, you know, raising it as a
                        possibility. I mean it is not very impressive, I think.</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the five year rule is looming?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: It was looming, and we failed abysmally in our attempts to secure a
                    waiver of the rule. And in the course of bidding on assignments, I chose a fork
                    in the road that would have a major impact on the rest of my career in the
                    Foreign Service. Basically, I remember thinking that after years of hard work
                    and the frustration of not being able to have a full tour on the Hungary/Baltic
                    Desk, I opted to bid on what I then termed a “lifestyle tour”, namely an
                    assignment in the Caribbean, which I thought would be a nice change. I recall
                    talking to Roz Ridgway about whether this would hurt my career, and seemed to
                    think it wouldn't as long as I didn't overdo it and that gaining exposure to a
                    new region could be positive. In any case, I did apply for a few jobs in what I
                    considered “serious places” while at the same time bidding on the assignment of
                    senior political officer in a regional post, one covering many different islands
                    from Barbados. In the end, I went to Bridgetown. Embassy Bridgetown was unusual
                    not only because the Political Section covered seven different countries, but
                    also because different agencies represented at Post covered a range of different
                    countries. For example, the Defense Attach� assigned to Barbados was responsible
                    for a region from Jamaica to Trinidad, whereas USIS had a somewhat different
                    area of responsibility. In any event, I arrived in Barbados in the summer of
                    1988 and made some interesting discoveries. .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from '88 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: I had a full three-year tour there from 1988 to 1991 and gained some
                    valuable insights about “living in Paradise”. For starters, it seemed as though
                    nearly the entire post tried to curtail their tours. Apparently, this pattern
                    remains true even to this day, stilling having one of the highest requests for
                    curtailment in the service. Several years before I arrived, it turns out, the
                    Department had sent a team of psychologists to the region to ascertain the
                    reasons for the high rate of attempted curtailments, in other words the nature
                    of the problems in Paradise. The report that emerged was fascinating. What I
                    learned from it was that unlike the case in hardship posts such as Bangladesh,
                    where many not only wish to stay but often extend their tours, this esprit de
                    corps seemed to be lacking in a tropical island with beaches and so on. So the
                    staff was not very happy. The situation in Barbados may cast some light on how
                    we Foreign Service Officers behave in general. In a nutshell, I think, we in the
                    Foreign Service thrive on a bit of “outside difficulty” which forces us to work
                    together as a team and which builds our “esprit”. What happens when you are in
                    an English speaking island where one is very much on one's own. Strange as it
                    may seem, many felt isolated. Barbados was not a big island but transportation
                    is a problem — the roads are narrow for one thing — and it takes a long time to
                    get from one part of the island to another and people were scattered. In
                    addition to the lack of a sense of community stemming from this and the fact
                    that individuals from different agencies were traveling constantly to different
                    islands, there were problems associated with the fact that spouses could not
                    work, the natives were not particularly friendly, etc. I was fortunate lucky to
                    make some local friends but many Americans believed you could live in Barbados
                    for three or four years and never see the inside of a local home. So, people
                    started getting island fever. Initially everyone assumed they would be spending
                    a lot of time at the beach, but the reality was that the officers had to work,
                    and with the sun setting around six o'clock year round, that was a quickly
                    thwarted expectation. Overall, it was an interesting learning experience. As I
                    said, I was more fortunate than many in that I enjoyed my work and many aspects
                    of my time there, but after a year, I, too, tried to curtail. And that
                    experience taught me a great deal about how our personnel system really worked.
                    What I encountered was a truly odd situation in which both my Post (Bridgetown)
                    was willing to let me leave and there was an “at grade-in cone” position for me
                    at Embassy Moscow, which apparently wanted me as well. Plus, the European Bureau
                    weighed in to have me assigned to the slot in Moscow. And yet, personnel made a
                    decision that had nothing to do with me or for that matter with find another
                    better suited applicant for that job. Instead, it had to do with the fact that
                    there was an officer working in Washington that had not served abroad in more
                    than six years and Personnel was determined to place that person in Moscow. That
                    is a summary of a much longer story which concluded with their sending someone
                    to Moscow who, although she had the requisite background and language skills,
                    did not want to go and for a time was most unhappy with the assignment — and so
                    was I. Ultimately, though I'm glad I stayed in Barbados. I learned a great deal
                    and it was all in all a positive experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think one of the problems there would be, this is,
                        you know, the place where you would put a political ambassador and the
                        political ambassadors in a place like that would not necessarily be out of
                        the top drawer of the selective political process.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: That may be. The first year I was there there was no ambassador at all
                    because the White House wanted to send a wealthy businesswoman from Long Island
                    with very close ties to the administration. Apparently, there were some
                    problems, or some financial issues or irregularities, which prompted some
                    negative reactions to her appointment. Her name was quietly withdrawn. There
                    seemed to be several such problem cases, and we were without an ambassador for
                    some time, and that in and of itself can become a problem.</p>
                <p>I should point out that there were also other more substantive reasons for
                    dissatisfaction at Post. If an officer had any ambition or interest in
                    substantive issues and found himself in a part of the world which, no matter how
                    lovely, did not seem to evoke strong interest in Washington , or if you wrote
                    cables describing the political environment in these islands and had the sense
                    that no one was paying attention, it could be quite frustrating. And more
                    attention should have been paid. After all, each of these mini-states has a vote
                    in the UN, just the same as China; yet they were, in fact, often overlooked.
                    However, there were times when we were not neglected, namely during CODEL
                    (Congressional Delegation) season. We did have a number of congressional and
                    other high-ranking delegations, some of which I was able to oversee. In fact, I
                    was the action officer for a vice-presidential visit when Dan Quayle came to
                    visit. While such delegations were, of course, welcomed by the islanders, their
                    leaders were well aware that some of these delegations did not come for the most
                    substantive of reasons. Some definitely came to play golf and socialize, and the
                    “boondoggle” aspects of these visits were demoralizing for the staff.</p>
                <p>That said, as one of my bosses there noted, the fun part of this type of job is
                    that you really are the big fish in a very small pond. And so I had two islands
                    that were — I have to put these in quotes — “my islands” and I would visit
                    frequently and attend their political conventions as well as have my own
                    high-level meetings.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For your two islands.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: Well, it was more than two, actually: St. Vincent and the Grenadines,
                    which consists of a whole chain of islands, and St. Lucia. And in addition I
                    followed some political developments in Barbados, as well. It was interesting
                    attending various political rallies and party conventions. Moreover, during that
                    period there was an active movement to unify the region by creating a federation
                    among the so-called “Windward Islands”. Such a movement had arisen in earlier
                    periods. In this iteration, the idea was to bring together the four Windward
                    Island nations into a federations. A constituent assembly was created for this
                    new entity, and numerous meetings were held. These four states included: St.
                    Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada and Dominica. The last of these
                    was somewhat important then because the Prime Minister was Eugenia Charles, who
                    had been instrumental in securing regional support for our 1983 intervention in
                    Grenada. Grenada, too, was significant because we still had a large U.S.
                    presence there. There were many interesting aspects to this unification process,
                    which did, in fact, result in some common actions and institutions but not full
                    blown unification, even to this day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Cubans messing around there or had Grenada sort
                        of turned them off that area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Minimally. But one unusual development relating to Cuba centered on the
                    current Prime Minister of St. Vincent Ralph Gonsalves. Gonsalves had been a
                    1960s student leader, an activist-leftist, considered to be a socialist, if not
                    communist. When I visited St. Vincent, I often met with him, as well as other
                    more established politicians, and got to know him fairly well. Since I went to
                    many of the political rallies, I made a point to attend his as well. Gonsalves
                    ran as a candidate for Parliament several times in hopes of one day becoming
                    Prime Minister one day. At that time, however, people insisted “Ralph” does not
                    stand a chance — not because he wasn't intelligent, capable or event honest, but
                    because of his former leftist background. On one occasion I went out with him on
                    the “hustings” to see how he campaigned. One such outing took us out into the
                    countryside, and I saw that he was , in fact, quite popular. Nevertheless, there
                    was still strong sentiment against electing a former “commie”. I mention this in
                    some detail because he was ultimately elected — despite his former whatever
                    affiliations — and serves as the Prime Minister today (2008). But then, as an
                    aspiring politician he had traveled so Libya and Cuba, then considered pariah
                    states. He was quite open to me about his travels and explaining why he went and
                    how the Libyans had provided him and his then young bride the wherewithal to
                    have a honeymoon in Rome while in transit to Libya. He was certainly not shy
                    about talking about this, which made him even more interesting.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what about drugs?</hi>

                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I ask because I have served in the region more recently. In the period
                    of the late '80s and early '90s, drugs while certainly available in the region,
                    were not as big an issue for some of the specific islands we were covering. They
                    represented drug transit countries, rather than large scale users or producers.
                    The local governments allowed our vessels to patrol the area and check things
                    out, if you will. Obviously Colombia was the main priority, but the routes used
                    to transport drugs from there to here and to Europe were clearly areas of
                    concern as well. This continued to be a priority throughout the ensuing years.
                    In the case of St. Vincent, I know that it produces a fair amount of marijuana
                    for external sale, not so much for local use. Vincentians may use it as much as
                    anyone, but local consumption is not a significant issue. And Ralph Gonsalves,
                    while not necessarily favoring it, has not done much to stop it. Some of the

                        Jamaica or the Dominican Republic or Venezuela, I mean, did these countries
                        have real influence or not?</hi>

                <p>TONGOUR: On whom?</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: Not really, not really at all. I think that we were perceived as the
                    elephant in the room. The smaller states kept wanting us to do more,
                    particularly to provide more assistance, and frankly were not doing very much.
                    Yet, in some ways we really did help. One case in point was that Barbados was
                    then the regional hub for USAID for the Eastern Caribbean. Embassy Kingston had
                    its own AID operation for Jamaica, as did Trinidad. Some years later, we
                    essentially closed down the AID mission in Barbados and conducted regional
                    programs out of Jamaica. Barbados had effectively “graduated” from the world of
                    assistance programs. Over time, however, there was a realization that it didn't
                    really work well to have all programs, especially for the southernmost islands,
                    operated out of Jamaica, and a small satellite office was reestablished in
                    Bridgetown. In short, we recognized their significance in terms of sheer numbers
                    of islands and countries but there wasn't a sustained substantive interest in
                    the region. Back in 1988, however, the 1983 intervention in Grenada was still
                    relatively fresh in people's memories as were preoccupations about what the
                    Cubans might do in the area. Actually, the Cubans are still doing many of the
                    same things as before, building hospitals, providing doctors and medical
                    training and other forms of assistance which are popular as well as relatively
                    low cost, but having a high impact. They did it then, and they do it now, but
                    there remains a certain amount of apprehension about accepting Cuban aid, which
                    may not be as warranted now as before. As for Venezuela, certainly not a major
                    factor then. Hugo Chavez was not a “player” and the entire political scene in
                    Venezuela then was quite different from today. Personally, while I was following
                    political developments on the different islands, I found there were very few
                    distinguishing issues or platforms among the parties. Basically, it was a case
                    of Tweedledee versus Tweedledum. Barbados is a perfect example, having two main
                    political parties, with miniscule differences currently between them, although
                    historically they were further apart. Today, people speak of the “B's” and the
                    “D's” which are ideologically now almost interchangeable, with families often
                    split between the two, but were once separated by powerful individual
                    leaders.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Although you were a political officer what about the
                        impact of tourism, or were you having these huge ships come in and dump
                        their passengers off for six hours of shopping or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: Yes, of course. But more significantly for us as a mission was the visa
                    angle. Embassy Bridgetown was a regional hub, although at the time we did have a
                    few more Embassies in the region than we do today. We subsequently closed our
                    posts in places such as Antigua and Martinique. Yet, even then, Barbados was a
                    visa issuing center. Consequently, we would have all these people coming from a
                    mmyriad islands, lined up around the block — the Consulate was then on the main
                    street — after having flown into Barbados in the morning and anticipating
                    returning the same day. The town of Bridgetown always seemed filled with visa
                    applicants seemingly milling around waiting for the U.S. Embassy to issue them a
                    visa. Between the visa seekers and the sunburned tourists wandering around in
                    their Bermuda shorts, downtown was quite a sight. In the crush of people,
                    someone would invariably get robbed and wind up seeking Embassy assistance in
                    resolving their problems. For us, there was never a shortage of work for us all,
                    and political officers occasionally pitched in during peak season on the visa
                    line. Plus, we did all the things that political officers do elsewhere —
                    business roundtables, CODELs and delegations, cultural exchanges, and a fair
                    amount of reporting.</p>

                <p>TONGOUR: While I was there we only had one.</p>

                <p>TONGOUR: His name is G. Philip Hughes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: G.-?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: G. Philip Hughes, which is the name he went by. His is an interesting
                    and somewhat unusual story. Although he sometimes was called Phil, did not want
                    anyone to know what the G in his name stood for. Apparently, his father had been
                    a fairly well-known baseball player for a Chicago team during its only winning
                    season (until recent years) and he bore his father's first name. The Ambassador,
                    however, had no interest in baseball and did not want to be associated with his
                    father's profession. In fact, when people would ask him what he played, he would
                    answer: the organ. Although he came from the Midwest and studied at a college in
                    Ohio before attending graduate school at Tufts, he had somehow acquired a
                    slightly affected British accent along the way. He was actually a nice guy but
                    the accent was initially misleading. So he arrived in Grenada my last year at
                    Post. I went with him on his rounds to the islands I covered, as did my
                    colleagues to other parts of the region. For us, it was quite a change from
                    having had a very traditional Foreign Service Officer serving as the Charg� for
                    two years to having a somewhat different type of individual as our Ambassador.
                    And the new DCM was quite different from the previous one — a woman named Barbro
                    Owens.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>I mention her because she, too, had an unusual background. Barbro, who is retired
                    now, is Scandinavian by birth — coming from Finland but of Swedish ancestry. Her
                    first husband was an American diplomat whom she met in that region. She herself
                    was an exceptionally bright woman who even earlier had done graduate work in the
                    U.S. — at Princeton, I think. At some point after marrying this American Foreign
                    Service officer whose last name is Owens, she entered the Foreign Service on her
                    own. I don't remember whether she actually accompanied him to any of his posts,
                    but they eventually divorced, and she went on to a number of tours in the
                    region, including an earlier stint in the Caribbean. During our intervention in
                    Grenada. So she knew the region. We had an interesting, even colorful group of
                    people at Post then. Barbro, herself, eventually married the Admin Officer, who
                    was there at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just wondering, you mention this and the beaches and
                        the people all over, was it one of these things that people started playing
                        around with other people's wives and husbands and things like this or was
                        this a fairly staid-?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I think Barbados was probably no different from any other Post on this
                    score, with its share of activity but no great scandals. The Ambassador was not
                    pleased that his DCM was going out with his Admin Officer but neither of the
                    pair was married. Still, he seemed to think there was a certain lack of decorum
                    for two of his senior staff to be dating each other, and he asked her to leave.
                    In any case, they subsequently married.</p>
                <p>On another topic, it's probably worth mentioning that in some ways it was an
                    awkward period for the staff. After not having had an Ambassador for two years,
                    we had gotten used to “being on our own” and it seemed a bit strange at first.
                    There were a lot of expectations associated with his arrival as well as a lot of
                    preparations, not to mention a shift in status for the political officers, who
                    for some time had essentially been acting as our country's official
                    representative. In my case, for example, I would escort him to islands where
                    everyone already knew me and weren't exactly sure what to make of the “new guy”
                    — perhaps not providing him the degree of deference he might have expected. It
                    was an adjustment, simply having an Ambassador around. .</p>
                <p>On the plus side, when time permitted, there was the sea, sun and the free
                    flowing rum, but to give the islands their due, people did work. We had our
                    share of issues to follow — often related to combating narco-trafficking in the
                    region and minor bilateral disputes. However, it was certainly not the same as
                    being in Tel Aviv or Moscow in terms of Washington's attention.</p>

                <p>TONGOUR: Well, I also became a single mother as a result during this period in
                    connection with a long term relationship in Barbados. Just before returning to a
                    fairly high-powered position on the Soviet Desk, I found myself pregnant and
                    decided to have the baby. Obviously, that's a much longer story but this is not
                    the place for it. .</p>

                <p>TONGOUR: Okay. Actually I can make this a broader discussion inasmuch as timing
                    may have made all the difference in the world — my own timing and the times we
                    were in for the Foreign Service. Had I been 22, perhaps the sky would have
                    fallen. Who knows how the parents or my immediate world might have reacted. At
                    this point in my life-</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How old were you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: I was already in my forties, and parental disapproval was no longer an
                    issue. In fact, my parents were quite happy to have a grandchild. Moreover, I
                    was personally and financially self-sufficient. From the Foreign Service
                    standpoint, I was very fortunate to wind up back in the proverbial “womb” of the
                    Soviet Desk. When you earlier asked about being part of a particular community
                    at State, I had already had one tour on the Soviet Desk, worked in Eastern
                    European affairs, and these were, you might say, my people, and I felt as though
                    I were going home again when I worked on the Soviet Desk the second time. I
                    hadn't announced my pregnancy before starting the job, but that was not a
                    problem. I took three months off after my son was born and then returned to
                    work. I was fortunate in being able to afford a nanny, and, therefore, could
                    return to work fulltime and carry my weight. Plus, my office was very welcoming
                    to this new addition; except for an occasional bout of baby sickness, my child
                    did not impinge on my work. You are absolutely right, though; a decade earlier
                    and it might have been a real problem. I'm sure it would have been. Now, single
                    motherhood seems to be quite common among women Foreign Service Officers, with
                    some adopting and others having their own babies. That said, there is no
                    question that in a broader sense, raising a child on one's own does impact on a
                    career, and I know it did in my case.</p>
                <p>For me, the main career problem or obstacle associated with single motherhood
                    centered on assignment choices. I know that from that point on, each time I had
                    to bid or make choices about where to go, I made decisions that I might not have
                    made had I been childless. The system did not make it difficult for me; I
                    basically made my own choices. Here is a perfect example: working on the Soviet
                    desk, I sometimes worked long hours, but I was in Washington. Having worked on
                    issues related to Moldova and Georgia, it would have been very logical and a
                    real option to follow my Desk job in SOV with a tour in either Moldova or
                    Georgia as Political Counselor. It was certainly a viable option. But when you
                    have a one or two year old child, do you want to take him to new posts such as
                    Tbilisi or Chisinau? The latter, in particular,, would have been a rough posting
                    at that point, with out staff still living in hotels. Ultimately, I decided
                    against these options and picking more “family-friendly postings, where the
                    workload would be more or less normal, rather than perhaps seeking the “prize”,
                    if you will or more demanding, “serious” assignments in Moscow or other areas of
                    the former Soviet Union. And as you know, there is a price to be paid for
                    “lifestyle” tours.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well actually, of course, married people with children

                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: That assignment was a regular Washington two-year tour, which started on
                    a very significant date: August 19, 1991. I had returned to D.C. a few days
                    before and was staying temporarily in a hotel. I recall watching the news before
                    going to the office and seeing “breaking news” from Moscow to the effect
                    Gorbachev was out. Meanwhile, as I'm sure I mentioned before, I had been
                    thinking how different our bilateral relations were then as compared to a few
                    years earlier and how much better the environment in this post-Cold War era. I
                    was very much looking forward to a tranquil period in our relationship. Instead,
                    we were immediately swamped — churning out contingency papers and analyses on
                    how to deal with the “day after”.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This raises a question. You know, again and again I talk
                        to other people and ask them, what was sort of the contribution of the CIA
                        and all, and you know, the answer, at least maybe at the highest level,
                        certainly of the NSC or something but basically there does not seem to be
                        much substantive input and I think the problem seems to rest in the Agency
                        one, is too big, so as it moves up through the layers of reports and all it
                        gets honed down and all, it loses all its bite. And two, it is not as
                        responsive to policy problems. In other words, what do we do today? I mean,
                        it is a little too almost academic.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: That was certainly the case then. They clearly had some papers but they
                    did not have “the” paper addressing what might happen immediately thereafter or
                    likely scenarios in the aftermath of the fall of Gorbachev.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: We did not know, but we were somewhat cocky at that moment. Perhaps
                    that's the wrong word, but after getting over the shock that we weren't going to
                    be provided with instant scenarios from without, we concluded we would just come
                    up with our own. And we did — drafting papers and sending them up our chain of
                    command discussing the issue of “what is to be done”.</p>

                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: When I first came onboard I was expected to work on, among other things,
                    a bilateral review commission intended to eliminate or minimize various, points
                    of friction, such as the “25-mile” rule and other contentious issues. I actually
                    no longer even recall what my initial portfolio was supposed to be since when
                    you are assigned to a multi- person desk, you do enter with an assigned
                    function. Given the fluctuating situation in the Soviet Union, our own
                    individual assignments were also somewhat in flux. Still, we did prepare for a
                    bilateral review commission which was eventually held, and we managed to get rid
                    of the 25-mile rule and other outstanding headaches. But almost immediately we
                    were all effectively drafted into small working groups based on the section to
                    which we had been initially assigned. I was in the so-called bilateral section
                    at first. Yet, within a few months the office configuration changed, with our
                    office leadership deciding to divide SOV along geographical lines&gt; My section
                    dealt with Moldova, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Ukraine and Belarus. Another
                    group was responsible for Central Asia, and a third focused on the Baltic
                    states. We spent considerable figuring out what we should be called. There was
                    no more Soviet Union or Soviet Desk. At first, we called ourselves ISCA,
                    standing for Independent States and Commonwealth Affairs. Later the office
                    became known as NIS (Newly Independent States) or CIS (Commonwealth of
                    Independent States) — there were several iterations. Our Office Director Larry
                    Napper concluded that since the Soviet Union was breaking apart into independent
                    states, we would transform ourselves accordingly, and essentially divide the
                    existing office into groupings of separate country desks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you sort of bid among yourselves?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Kind of. But it worked out well. I wound up with Georgia, which was
                    viewed as a potential hot spot. However, it was decided that I could handle a
                    somewhat larger portfolio. At the time Moldova was viewed as a “sleeper” and
                    deemed a good complement to the already busy “Georgia account. Well little
                    Moldova wound up having as many conflicts as Georgia; consequently, I wound up
                    covering two wine producing states that were both embroiled in major internal
                    struggles. My role, like that of my peers was initially to do whatever was
                    needed: preparing option papers, figuring out next steps, etc. whether on the
                    prospective commission or other projects on the docket and gradually shifting
                    focus to serving as the first ever desk officer for the newly emerging countries
                    of Georgia and Moldova. Initially, it was not clear whether Moldova would
                    survive as an independent entity or be swallowed up by one of its neighbors —
                    Romania or Russia — because of the ongoing conflict in region.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: That is right, and a major portion of my work was to ensure that higher
                    ups in the Department understood the situation and recognized that it did
                    matter.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in the first place, looking at the whole, I do not
                        know what you want to call it, the former Soviet desk or bureau, how would
                        you describe sort of the spirit of things? Was this a hell of a lot of fun
                        with the adrenaline pulsing through you and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Absolutely. It was a heady time, an exciting period in many ways. After
                    all, this is the end of '91 and early '92. Not only was the Soviet Union coming
                    apart, but major change is occurring in America as well — a new president and a
                    different configuration of people at the top. At State, our Under Secretary was
                    Strobe Talbott, who essentially oversaw, or basically was in charge of our
                    policy toward the former Soviet Union. For us, there was real electricity in the
                    air. I would not go so far as to say there was unvarnished optimism because we
                    really had no idea what was going to happen but certainly there was never a dull
                    moment. In our office, we were exhilarated by being a small part of the process
                    associated with such monumental changes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well let us take your two places; let us take Georgia
                        first. What was the situation in Georgia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Georgia was in a state of real upheaval for several reasons. First, two
                    active, full-blown conflicts were underway. One was the conflict in the region
                    known as Ossetia, split between North and South Ossetia, with the former
                    attached to Russia, and the latter remaining a part of Georgia. In adjacent
                    areas with the same ethnic mixes, the basic question was whether they should
                    remain divided or be united under one umbrella or another. Secondly, there was,
                    and still remains, another active — though perhaps a bit more subdued — conflict
                    in , Abkhazia, essentially a breakaway region in the western part of Georgia,
                    where there was strong Russian influence, particularly along the coast. Then,
                    too, a third region known as Ajaria had a strongman leader, who, while not
                    attempting to secede, was ruling his territory as though he were an autonomous
                    potentate. In addition to these tensions, was the issue of the “new kid in
                    town”, the new leader of Georgia being the former Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
                    Shevardnadze, who was not universally beloved by the Georgians for several
                    reasons. First, in their view, his longstanding, active service on behalf of the
                    Soviets raised doubts questions about his bona fides as a real Georgian and his
                    commitment to Georgia. I think he eventually persuaded them that he was but that
                    cost him vis-�-vis the relationship with Russia. Secondly, he had come to power
                    on the heels of the ouster of the heretofore quite popular nationalist leader
                    Gamsakhurdia, which also made Shevardnadze a bit suspect. In addition to the
                    previously mentioned struggles, his position was made more precarious by the
                    fact that Russia and Russians had always regarded Georgia in a special way, as a
                    civilized Christian nation amidst many Moslem groupings, one of their “own kind”
                    in other words. For Russian, having their former (Soviet) Foreign Minister as
                    the Georgian head of state was distasteful; adding insult to injury, he was also
                    someone the U.S. very much liked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, because he and Baker, our secretary of state, were
                        practically the Bobbsey twins during the break up and the last gasp of the
                        Soviet Union.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: Exactly. So that created a very exciting panorama. I recall sitting in
                    on the meetings we held with Shevardnadze on the periphery of the UN General
                    Assembly session, when he came to New York in his new capacity, which was
                    fascinating. For our part, there was a great deal of sympathy for, investment
                    and assistance to Georgia during that period, with considerably less activism,
                    as I indicated in Moldova. But I have to admit that in some ways working on
                    Moldova was actually more satisfying. There were certain parallels to my stint
                    as the desk officer for Hungary and the Baltics. When the chain of command was
                    not paying a great deal of attention to a particular area, the officer in charge
                    could “push the envelope, put forward positions and even influence policy
                    related to a particular country or situation. Basically, it was up to the desk
                    officer to convince superiors that a particular country mattered and was
                    strategically important. In the case of Moldova, my efforts seemed to work. I
                    take personal satisfaction from having gradually gotten my bosses to focus more
                    and more on Moldova. Although Georgia clearly started out as the regional
                    darling, after a while Moldova increasingly was perceived as the “little engine
                    that could”. There was growing sympathy for the Moldovans standing up for
                    themselves opting to make Romanian the national language while insisting on
                    their independence, rather than being incorporated into Romania. Moldova wound
                    up with a number of fans, if you will, in our office and the Department as a
                    whole. Moldova was the little engine that could, you know. There was a certain
                    gradual sympathy for the Moldovans standing up and the fact that they chose to
                    have the Romanian language but that they did not want to be swallowed up by
                    Romania gave them a lot of fans, if you will, in the European Bureau and the
                    State Department as a whole</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I want to stick to Georgia for a little while. How
                        did we view, I mean, you had this dukedom off to one side, a warlord or
                        something, and then you had the Russians in - was it Sochi, which I am told
                        has beautiful- it is a great place for retired Soviet army officers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Right, right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then the other one. I mean, what were we doing about
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: We were trying to keep it together but there was a limit to what we
                    could do. We were certainly providing various forms of assistance to the central
                    government and to Shevardnadze, but there were also issues of national
                    sovereignty and the extent we could or should intervene on his behalf. There
                    were several different ethnic different groups, some of whom opposed him as a
                    usurper as a result of the ouster of the popularly-elected Gamsakhurdia, whom
                    Shevardnadze replaced. There was definitely a three- ring circus feeling to the
                    situation, but certainly we provided substantial assistance, guidance, and
                    advisor on a host of topics — how to write a constitution or hold parliamentary
                    elections and so on. It was a booming enterprise. Our embassy there was a very
                    lively place.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And was there, in the first place was there a Georgian
                        community, I mean, the head of the joint chiefs of staff was Shalikashvili
                        who was from there but was there much of a Georgian American?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Not really in the sense of a formal grouping, when compared to any of
                    the other countries I have worked on — and, of course, this may have
                    subsequently changed. I do not mean to imply there were no Georgian groups;
                    there were some, but they were relatively small. I remember in the Adams Morgan
                    area there was one restaurant run by a Georgian, who even called it a Georgian
                    restaurant, but that was rare. By now, there are probably more, but then it was
                    all too new. Likewise there was no formal Moldovan community to speak of, or at
                    least not one that pressed to make itself known..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you ourselves trying to initiate anything that
                        would sort of ease the civil war or not or was it really something we just
                        kept pretty well- we just had to sit there and watch developments?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: No, we did do more and concern was also expressed in the UN and other
                    fora aimed at helping out and encouraging others to do the same. Similarly,
                    there were bilateral overtures toward the Russians, pressing them to back off,
                    to stand down and indicating that we would view Russian military involvement as
                    a matter of grave concern. So, we engaged in diplomatic efforts and provided all
                    sorts of assistance. Not only in Georgia, but in general we were quite
                    supportive of these newly independent states. In the case of Georgia, and
                    especially in the early phase of its independence, we sought to bolster
                    Shevardnadze to the extent we could and to convey to the Russians that we would
                    not look kindly upon attempts to undermine him. On several occasions when we
                    really thought the Russians were about to intervene, we did issue strong
                    demarches to this effect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, Moldova. You had this, what, Transdniester, almost
                        republic which was- I mean, what I gather, I mean, this is a great market
                        for us to buy up Soviet equipment and ___________. Were you involved in
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: Other offices more specifically focused on military affairs were the
                    ones directly involved in this, but obviously I stayed informed. Looking back on
                    it now, if you consider the geography of the region, this was one conflict zone
                    that made sense from the Russian perspective — much as Ukraine does as well.
                    Given the large contingent of Russian speakers or ethnic Russians living there,
                    both they and the Russian government saw them as but an extension of Russia. And
                    from their standpoint, the “upstart” Romanians were effectively encroaching onto
                    their turf. While willing to cede one side of the river, they were not willing
                    to part with the Transnistrian region to the east, which they not only saw as
                    theirs but where they had stockpiled military equipment and personnel. So, yes,
                    Russian armaments and supplies were in abundance in this Russian-speaking
                    enclave. One of the more interesting features of this region as a whole was that
                    the populace had been educated in Russian for so long that while there were
                    certainly plenty of individuals who spoke Romanian, especially at home, others
                    who, regardless of their ethnicity, were more comfortable speaking in Russian. A
                    similar situation prevails in eastern Ukraine, especially in the Odessa region,
                    where many see themselves as both from Ukraine and ethnically or linguistically
                    Russian; some of these do not speak Ukrainian well. And then, of course, in
                    Transnistria there was General Lebedev, the general in charge of the military
                    encampment in Transnistria, who had also been a major figure in the Soviet
                    campaign in Afghanistan. He proved to be a key player in the Transnistrian
                    conflict; later on, he actually ran for President of Russia as well. : He was
                    quite a major figure at one time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I would think that having Moldova you have the

                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Moldova was quite ethnically diverse for so small a country. There was
                    also a Turkic ethnic group, known as the Gagauz. This was a small contingent,
                    originally from Turkey who maintain that they have been in Moldova for
                    centuries. They and pockets of other nationalities made for an interesting mix.

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Alright, we will stop here and we have been talking- you
                        are going to review a little about Georgia but also Moldova and talk about
                        the relationship of the Ukraine and with really- We have not talked really
                        about the internal setup of Moldova and our relationship with them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I'll quickly mention that for the first year that I handled this
                    portfolio, many months passed before a truly functioning government, in terms of
                    inspiring confidence in its viability, really got off the ground. And there was
                    considerable doubt as to whether Moldova would make it or rather that it would
                    not be reintegrated into one of its neighboring states.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: No. We had gotten up to basically 1991, and I think we had left off
                    where I had returned from overseas in August of 1991 and begun working on the
                    Soviet Desk.</p>

                <p>TONGOUR: That came the next year but before I had that happened I had returned
                    thinking I would be a desk officer on the traditional Soviet desk, working on
                    U.S.-Soviet relations but my first day back coincided with the end of
                    Gorbachev's rule. The period that followed was one of the most exciting and
                    exhilarating of times, when we really tried to address a myriad “what ifs” an
                    “what type of” situations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bureaucracies interest me, particularly our State

                        this sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: You mean when we were eventually breaking it up into desks?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: I don't know. Frankly, I think if it occurred, it happened at a much
                    higher level. I think there was a sense that the people who were originally
                    focusing on certain types of issues would naturally be assigned to certain
                    portfolios, but initially we were simply divided into small groups. So for
                    example, I was originally supposed to work in the Bilateral Section. As I
                    previously mentioned, the office had previously been divided along functional
                    lines. Now the Bilateral Section was basically reconfigured to be a regional
                    office, with a few of us winding up working on Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova and
                    another group worked on the Caucasus, etc. What was noteworthy at that time was
                    the notion that certain countries — not necessarily in terms of importance to us
                    — would be “busier” than others and take up more of an officer's time. And so
                    what we knew from the outset was that one officer would focus on Azerbaijan and
                    Armenia and another — me in this case — would handle Georgia and “something
                    else”. That something else turned out to be Moldova. In retrospect, our internal
                    situation on the Desk in late 1991 and early 1992 frankly mirrored the fluidity
                    of the former Soviet Union. We were very much focused on the so-called bigger
                    questions associated with what it meant for the Soviet Union to no longer exist
                    and how to tailor our relationship to Russia, first and foremost, in this new
                    scenario. Overall, there was a sense of quasi-optimism, if you will, on that
                    score. We certainly did not want to overlook Russian misdeeds, whether in
                    Georgia or elsewhere, but we (I'm speaking of our office in particular) wanted
                    to be forward leaning and we sought to find ways to resolve some of the
                    longstanding bilateral issues. And in fact, in thinking back on this period, I
                    recall that we still were working on the Bilateral Review Commission, something
                    that had been set in motion before the demise of the Soviet Union, intended to
                    be an annual event in which we met with the Soviets work on or at least iron out
                    our differences. So for much of the first months of the new regime the central
                    question was how does the dissolution of the Soviet Union impact on our dealings
                    with “new Russia” and then down the proverbial food chain with the other
                    countries of the former Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can remember the feeling, I think the feeling of
                        optimism was everywhere and you know, you had Baker and Shevardnadze walking
                        hand in hand in Wyoming, you know.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: That is right. And to add one small comment to that, looking back at
                    Moldova in light of the fact that Georgia certainly received more attention
                    then, it would be fair to say that initially the reasons for the limited
                    attention paid to Moldova had little or nothing to do with Russia. Given the
                    ethnic breakdown of the region, our starting assumption regarding Moldova was
                    that it would either choose to unite with Romania or Romania would make that
                    choice for the Moldovans in some fashion or another. It was not that we didn't
                    care at that point but it was not exactly a top priority. It became a bit more
                    of a priority as well as a somewhat of a shock when tow things happened. First,
                    “little Moldova”, alone among former Soviet Republics paid off some of its
                    debts, or rather its portion of the former Soviet debt owed to us, which
                    endeared Moldova to us and fostered the image of Moldova as the little engine
                    that could.</p>

                    <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, this goes back to after World War I when Finland
                        paid off its debts and Finland won a place in our hearts that, you know,
                        even I, as a small kid, were ever- say well, the Finns paid their
                        debts.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: That is right. I do not know that Moldova completed the process, but the
                    country made some good faith efforts on that score. Secondly, there was an
                    election in Moldova and while I no longer remember the detail, the election
                    basically was a referendum on unification with Romania. The general expectation
                    going into the election was that the party favoring such unity would win; yet it
                    did not. The actual winner was the more nationalistic “Moldova for Moldovans” or
                    “Moldovans for Independence” type party. That took us back a bit. I would not
                    say we were totally shocked but the outcome was somewhat unexpected.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you figure out what were the factors; was it because
                        Romania had been such a disaster under Ceausescu?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Maybe, to a certain extent. However, there was a another, perhaps more
                    salient, factor. I think we just assumed that Moldovans generally wanted to be
                    part of a greater Romania and would be happy playing the role of younger
                    brother. Frankly, there was a certain arrogance among the Romanians vis-a-vis
                    Moldovans, regarding them somewhat as the country bumpkin cousins, while others,
                    including us were treating them as a potentially “real” country. While the vast
                    majority of Moldovans would never deny their ties or linguistic and cultural
                    affinity to Romania, I think many wanted to see if they could survive on their
                    own. The real shock was that Moldova was starting down this path at the very
                    time when they experienced a major blow, namely the onset of the Transnistrian
                    conflict, when the Russian-backed forces in that region staged a rebellion and
                    refused to recognize Moldovan government authority. That was the official
                    beginning of the conflict, in the summer of 1992, between Moldova and the
                    “Transnistrian Authority”, which in some form or another has persisted — more
                    recently in a “cold war” manner —for lo these many years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you getting- were you in close consultation with
                        the Romanian desk and what was sort of their attitude?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: We were. And initially, again, it was the Romanian desk that assumed the
                    Moldovans would naturally gravitate to the orb of Bucharest. They were as
                    surprised as w when the Moldovans opted for an independent path instead.
                    Probably, my main contribution as the Moldovan Desk Officer was to convince my
                    chain of command that it mattered that the Russian-back Transnistrian forces
                    were undercutting the viability of this very fragile state and since it was a
                    western leaning state, friendly to us and responsive in terms of its debt
                    obligations, etc., we should either on our own or more likely in conjunction
                    with regional groupings (e.g. the precursor of the OSCE) send observers and to
                    some extent become engaged.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of role was Ukraine doing? I mean, Ukraine sort
                        of sits a fork the lines of communication from the Transdniester region. How
                        could sort of the Russian forces survive in that geographic position?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Several years later I would be focusing more on Ukraine. At the time, I
                    recall there was a somewhat fluid border situation, including the movement of
                    some munitions and supplies. Overall, I'm sure the Ukrainians were more
                    preoccupied with their own situation vis-a-vis Russia and focusing more on
                    questions of immediate interest to them such as the future of Crimea and the
                    Odessa region to involve themselves overly in what was happening in
                    “Bessarabia”. They clearly paid attention and may have offered some support but
                    were not then seized with that conflict. .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what about, what were we getting, what were you
                        getting about what was going on in this Transdniester area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Officially our people were not even supposed to go to Transnistria and
                    when they did, it was a major production, requiring permission from authorities
                    on both sides of the river as well as from Washington. What was really
                    remarkable was that we were the primary source of information, in the best sense
                    of the word, for other, European countries, which were interested in the region
                    but had fewer resources to commit to the area. Consequently, I wound up spending
                    some time briefing European Embassies in Washington about what we were finding
                    out about the Transnistrian situation, based on our albeit limited information.
                    Gradually we got our own act together to inform the Russians that we were not
                    indifferent to the fate of this small country, and encouraged them to stand down
                    from real incursions or adverse actions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was happening on the ground? Was the Soviet army, a
                        division or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Yes. I think it was called the 14th battalion or division (I can't
                    remember) under General, Lebedev, who...</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who later ran for president of the country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: That is right, and he had been in Afghanistan and elsewhere. They had
                    basically seized a major power plant that was in the Transnistrian region and
                    were hindering Moldovan access to power. This was obviously a major problem for
                    Moldova. The situation was dicey. It was not a “hot conflict” with major
                    battles, but a conflict that was literally “close to home”, with the
                    establishment of the “Transnistrian Republic” just across a small river. In
                    reality, it was somewhat of a standoff because the Moldovan military lacked the
                    resources to really take on the sizeable Russian-Transnistrian forces, which
                    called themselves the Transnistrian Army..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get a feel that, I mean, was this sort of a
                        criminal conspiracy, I mean, was criminality sort of a major cause of the
                        being for this Transdniester thing, smuggling, human trafficking, that sort
                        of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: You know, anymore it is hard to know which was the chicken or the egg or
                    rather what was cause and what effect. The problem, which one finds throughout
                    the former Soviet Union, certainly existed in Georgia as well. Over the course
                    of hundreds of years Russians fanned out and lived in enclaves in these regions.
                    There was a legitimate minority group, ethnically either Russian or
                    Russian-speaking, living in these former republics and they were certainly not
                    comfortable with the sudden turnaround. For some of them it was a matter of
                    national prestige. Imagine how we would if suddenly Hawaii went off on its own.
                    For those people of the previously dominant group nationalism was definitely a
                    factor. I think for Lebedev and others of his ilk the issue then had little to
                    do with drugs or criminality. Drugs and crime would become more salient factors
                    later on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we trying, at your level, I mean, passing on to your

                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Oh yes. Well, I mean, it was nothing so formal. The Russian desk was 50
                    feet from my office. It was not as though we had to cross town to communicate.
                    We certainly did talk constantly amongst ourselves and all the way up our food
                    chain again about whatever was happening.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>Something else that warrants mentioning is that in some respects our staff in the
                    field were operating almost as though they were in the “wild west”. Keep in mind
                    there had not been anything resembling an embassy in Chisinau, so initially our
                    mission was “housed” in a small, rather interesting structure, in which the
                    entire post ate lunch together with the char force doubling as cooks, who made
                    soup and bread each day for the staff. It was a cozy arrangement which seemed
                    perfectly normal at the times. The Ambassador was the only person then at post
                    who actually lived in an apartment, and it was far from palatial; the rest of
                    the staff were all still living in hotels then. And the U.S. Embassy was the
                    lucky one, the first to get up and running — opening up our shop as it were
                    within the year. But there was a very positive feeling about the experience, and
                    a great deal of camaraderie on the part of the staff. When I visited the post, I
                    was very impressed with the high morale..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. I noticed it had gotten better when I went to Bishkek
                        in, I think '94, and it was pretty primitive. You know, one place which
                        would be considered a modest house here in Arlington and that is where the
                        whole embassy was located.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Well, how about the role, and I do not want to get into details, but from the
                    desk perspective were you getting much out of the CIA, from their analysis?</p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Eventually we received some help from their analytical branch, and we
                    received some useful support after the break up of the Soviet Union, but not
                    much before then.</p>
                <p>On another topic, I don't think we have fully exhausted our discussion of
                    developments on the “Georgia front”. Georgia, after all, was one of our top
                    priorities. You asked if we nudged the Russia Desk. We certainly did on Moldovan
                    issues and even more forcefully on George where we put whatever pressure we
                    could on both the Russian and Georgian sides to stand down and not exacerbate
                    problems in Abkhazia and South Ossetia — continuing issues even to this day. In
                    that period, our President actually sent forward letters to both of their
                    leaderships that our office drafted. .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Georgia of course, just because of sort of the
                        people; I mean, you had Stalin coming out of there, you had Shevardnadze,
                        who was a great friend of Baker and I do not know where he was at this time
                        but Shalikashvili was at one point the chairman of the joint chiefs of
                        staff. So I mean, you had this Georgian connection with America, you know,
                        it was recognizable and all.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: Well, even before Secretary Baker, his predecessor George Shultz had
                    been very concerned about Georgian developments and close to its leadership. He
                    was interested in Shevardnadze not simply as the leader of Georgia but as the
                    former Soviet Foreign Minister and his primary interlocutor in the region when
                    he had been Secretary. I remember, jumping ahead, the year after I left the
                    Desk, I spent a year in San Francisco at the Asia Foundation and went down to
                    Stanford, to the Hoover Institution at his request to brief him on what was
                    going on in Georgia. By that point, he was already out of the government, but
                    still interested in what was happening in that region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were you involved in the shopping spree of the
                        military and I guess intelligence agencies, trying to pick up Russian
                        equipment which was up for sale, you know, surreptitiously or not, I mean,
                        we were tried to pick up- and of course the former Soviet troops wanted to
                        get rid of this stuff because they would get money for it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I was somewhat aware of these kinds of activities rather than directly
                    involved. Several years later I had a job that involved assistance to the former
                    Soviet Union, where we had a big program to “help” scientists who had previously
                    worked biological warfare projects or nuclear research transition to civilian
                    employment — somewhat similar to programs for scientists following World War II
                    — and meaningful work. We weren't necessarily interested in having them emigrate
                    but rather in ensuring that they were gainfully employed and not exporting their
                    expertise or products to rogue states.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Of course, this is a very big deal. Let's stick to
                        Moldova for a bit, the government? Was it a relatively responsible
                        government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: At that time, very definitely. In a way, attaining power sort of hit
                    them by surprise, too. Their leadership ranks included a group of young
                    energetic types who seemed genuinely committed to Moldova. When I went there to
                    visit, I recall meeting all kinds. I do not want to imply that everyone at the
                    helm was a saint but in general there seemed to be a fairly decent group —
                    especially when compared to some of the other former republics — then. But
                    again, that was the early period. I have not followed Moldova closely in the
                    intervening years, so I do not know what the current leadership represents.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But at the time, I mean, these were-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: By the time we began to focus seriously on Moldova, the Moldovans were
                    just having their first election and picking some fairly forward-leaning
                    representatives who sought to assure us they wanted to maintain their
                    independence and neither return to the Russian fold or unite with Romania.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they have an embassy here?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Not at the beginning, but, yes, by the end of my tour. All of the former
                    republics did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we get involved in the training? I know we at one
                        point here at the Foreign Service Institute where we are talking we were
                        training, among others, Albanian diplomats. I, at about this time a retired
                        Foreign Service officer, was sent to Kyrgyzstan to talk about setting up a
                        consular service. I mean, we were trying to get these people into the
                        community as fast as they could absorb the knowledge.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Let's put it this way: I know they asked for guidance and support and
                    acknowledged in many ways how unprepared they were to work in the diplomatic
                    arena. Actually a few Moldovans had served as diplomats in the Soviet system but
                    being on one's own was a different matter. But they had not reached the point of
                    asking us to provide training for them at our Foreign Service Institute. I think
                    we had gotten around to instituting International Visitor Programs for them,
                    including programs for journalists traveling to the States. But in terms of
                    formal training programs, I think we were further along with Georgia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were saying that you found yourself paying more
                        attention to Moldova much to your surprise than you were to Georgia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: No. I would not say more than Georgia but rather roughly the same; yet
                    this defied expectations because where there were many people focusing on
                    Georgia, relatively few paid attention to Moldova at the outset. Essentially, if
                    there were papers to be written on Moldova — and our business consisted largely
                    in writing briefing memos and sending them up the ranks — or if someone would be
                    pushing the envelope regarding Moldova, it would basically happen at the
                    midlevel officer level — in this period basically me. As for Georgia, on the
                    other hand, there were many other people equally willing to push for Georgia.
                    Certainly, I was the desk officer, but there were others waving the flag. My
                    main point here is that while my bosses expected that I would spend 75 to 80
                    percent of my time on Georgia, with the remainder on Moldova, in fact, Moldova
                    took up its fair share. Gradually, with the blessings of my supervisors, there
                    was an increasingly widespread recognition that more attention to this small
                    country was warranted.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>Another interesting factor worth mentioning is just how difficult the Russians
                    were making it to get to travel to Georgia. If you wanted to go to Tbilisi, it
                    was no mean feat. I remember taking an orientation trip to my two posts. It was
                    relatively easy to get to Moldova via Frankfurt or Moscow or event Kiev, in
                    short from various places. But for Georgia, at that time there was a commercial
                    flight once a week from Vienna or the iffy alternative of flying from Moscow
                    when gas was available. In that period, Aeroflot officially no longer flew to
                    Georgia. An Aeroflot subsidiary supposedly had a contract for flights to
                    Tbilisi, but the arrangement was fluid at best. As I was leaving Washington for
                    this trip, my colleagues bet that I could not make it from Moldova to Georgia
                    via Moscow in one day. The first part — Chisinau to Moscow — was easy, But once
                    in Moscow, there was no sign that Aeroflot or any other carrier would be flying
                    to Tbilisi that day. At least no flights were listed. Eventually I learned that
                    I had to find a certain kiosk, a booth with a window, where one could pay for a
                    ticket and be told that when sufficient money was raised to purchase gasoline
                    for the plane, the flight would depart. I remember being told not to wander too
                    far away because an announcement could be made at any time. This conversation
                    was in Russian, which fortunately I spoke. I can't imagine what would have
                    happened otherwise. As it was, I had to ask countless persons for information
                    and guidance. The loudspeaker announcements were far from clear. In fact, the
                    message concerning the departing Tbilisi flight was scarcely intelligible or
                    audible. In short, I spent five or six hours waiting to see whether or not there
                    would be a plane. After a time, people in that section of the waiting area began
                    talking to each other, and we became sort of comrades in arms, all waiting for
                    the same plane. Finally, the plane was called. Presumably, they succeeded in
                    getting enough money for gas. And we walked across the tarmac looking a bit like
                    refugees clutching our bags. I will never forget this experience. I have flown
                    in a lot of bad planes but this may have been the worst. Standing at the top of
                    the stairway was a guy who looked to be a character in a mafia film smoking a
                    cigarette — smoking very near the plane's gas tank. Once inside, I saw actual
                    chickens in the open, overstuffed overhead compartments. Eventually, we took off
                    and eventually landed, and the pilot, to give him his due, landed on an icy
                    runway as though on a dime. The point of all this is that by the end of the week
                    I was at the Tbilisi airport waiting for the flight from Vienna, and it was
                    equally iffy whether the return flight would be able to take off because the
                    availability of gas in Tbilisi, likewise provided by the Russian gas company,
                    was also uncertain. So the Russians were not making it easy for the Georgians
                    then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you observe when you got to Georgia, to Tbilisi
                        and all? What was your impression?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: What I observed was that the country basically had an edgy feel to it.
                    Everywhere you went, there was a sense that someone was probably armed and that
                    there was probably a good reason for the metal detectors at the entrance of the
                    main hotel for Westerners. It was common knowledge that there had been shootings
                    at the hotel, involving supporters of the previously elected government and its
                    opponents. As I mentioned Shevardnadze was not initially the darling of all
                    Georgians, even if he may have been ours and that of other nations. After all,
                    Gamsakhurdia had been duly elected president and then been ousted by forces
                    deemed more sympathetic, with Shevardnadze emerging from the latter group. The
                    story was more convoluted than this but basically he was invited to return by
                    the elements opposing Gamsakhurdia, who still had a strong following in the
                    western part of the country. And even further west was the region of Abkhazia
                    were tension was and remains rife. Even in the streets of Tbilisi you could see
                    where fighting had occurred, with old bullet holes and shattered windows still
                    visible. If Chisinau seemed somewhat dull, or gray despite some nice buildings
                    (some of a backwater like a setting for a Chekhovian play), Tbilisi seemed a bit
                    dicey by comparison. This was in the beginning, when our support was only
                    beginning to pour in. Our Embassy there, however, was a former palatial
                    residence, if not an actual palace, though not a fully furnished one. There,
                    too, the staff ate lunch together on the premises but in a room resembling a
                    fancy hall. Moreover, our staff were already living in apartments — another
                    contrast to Chisinau — and they were quite nice. Tbilisi had many interesting
                    places to visit, but the slight feeling of danger in the air was definitely
                    present.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How well were we able to work with them, I mean, our
                        embassy and all, to work with them in Georgia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Within Tbilisi?</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: In Tbilisi they were able to work quite well but there were some
                    restrictions on their mobility; staff were not encouraged to roam around. On one
                    level, the situation was quite positive in that the Shevardnadze government was
                    very responsive and receptive to us, but Embassy personnel were told not to go
                    out at night unless accompanied by “escorts”. That was the way the people lived
                    then; crime and violence were very real concerns.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was our ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: Ambassador Kent Brown, a very good guy and very enthusiastic about
                    Georgia. I have known several of the others: Bill Courtney who served there
                    after Ambassador Brown and later still John Tefft, our current ambassador. And
                    it seemed that everyone who served there somehow got hooked on Georgia and its
                    people. The Georgians in general are very charming and the country is colorful,
                    with a rich history, and a Christian countries which also adds to its appeal for
                    Americans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you feeling any Georgian �migr� influence when you
                        were on the desk and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Very little. We began talking about this last time. There may have been
                    more later on, when I had another tour that dealt with the former Soviet Union.
                    Certainly in the 1999-2001 period there was a much greater degree of coordinated
                    activity. Frankly, the only desk in which I was exposed to substantial �migr�
                    activity was during my tour as the Hungary and Baltic Republics Desk Officer.
                    Both had very active �migr� elements here who were keen on staying in close
                    contact with the State Department. I do not know how many Moldovans there are in
                    the U.S. Certainly there were groups that called on us, especially when Moldovan
                    officials were here visiting, but it was nothing comparable to the Ukrainian
                    lobbies, which I got to know later. And there were definitely some Georgians
                    too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I would think that- maybe I got- I know from Armenia
                        supposedly but with Georgia, I am told, that you know, there used to be
                        almost daily flights of people coming from these Caucasian areas of the
                        Soviet Union go to Moscow and they would have big baskets full of stuff
                        which they would sell.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And I was wondering, was that trade completely stopped
                        pretty much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I do not think so. I think that the black market trade continued and
                    that was where one found much of the so-called Russian mafia. This may have
                    toned down a bit in recent years, but I don't really know. A recent movie called
                    “Eastern Promises” dealt with just this theme with many people becoming very
                    wealthy, and a number of these originating in the Caucasus and then making it
                    big in Moscow. As for your question about the differences between the Georgians
                    and Armenians here, I'd have to say that while the Georgians got to know our
                    leadership and developed close relationships at the top, they had no enclaves
                    comparable to places in California and elsewhere of strong Armenian communities
                    having enormous influence.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any spillover of Armenians into Georgia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Yes. There is actually a southern province of Georgia with a large
                    Armenian population, but it was a fairly quiet group and did not put undue
                    pressure on the Georgian government. But, I don't know what the situation is
                    today. Quite possibly as other groups began agitating for more rights within
                    Georgia, the Armenians may have grown more vocal as well. We don't here much
                    about that area. Earlier, we spoke a bit about the conflict in South Ossetia and
                    Abkhazia but there was also a strongman in another region known as Ajaria. He
                    had not tried to break away but at the time was operating as though he was in
                    control of his own fiefdom . So Georgia was plagued with a smattering of groups
                    seeking to assert their own autonomy as well as other entities engaged in
                    nefarious or criminal activities such as kidnappings and robberies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume that if one traveled by car, if you were a
                        diplomat, that the police would stop you and basically ask, you know, you
                        would have to slip them some money. I certainly found that in Bishkek in
                        Kyrgyzstan and I am told this happens all over. That is how the police get
                        their salary.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: That is right. That happens in other parts of the world as well. I know
                    that was the way it worked in Mexico as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about, while you were there did you find yourself
                        dealing with the non-governmental organizations? Because the former Soviet
                        Union was awash with all these groups that were coming out to do good or do
                        well or something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Some. I have to tell you that in recent years I have worked with NGOs so
                    much more that by comparison that particular period did not seem to be as rife
                    with them. In the beginning stages of state formation, much of the outcry, to
                    the extent that outcries regarding who did what to whom existed, centered on
                    what the Russians collectively were doing in a particular area. For example,
                    there was considerable pressure from human rights groups regarding individuals
                    arrested by Transnistrian authorities, persons languishing in jails, or
                    complaints about mistreatment of civilians (both Georgians and Abkhaz) in
                    Abkhazia, primarily by Russian-backed elements. At that juncture, the bulk of
                    such criticism was not leveled at the “host” Georgian or Moldovan governments.

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were you involved in supporting our efforts in
                        nation building?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: Yes, but we did not call it that then. That terminology seemed to emerge
                    a few years down the pike. That was in fact what we were doing. We were seeking
                    ways to aid civil society, promote elections, combat corruption — all the things
                    that we think of today when we speak of governance and nation building, and that
                    we continue to do. However, at that point we were still at stage one, namely how
                    to build a government or some sort of political entity that was not simply a
                    throwback to the old Soviet system. Even more basic: how to stage elections in
                    these regions, how to secure the elections and ensure non-interference by the
                    Russians. Another focal point was how to foster a modus vivendi with a former
                    giant in a now newly diminished status and help it move forward in a positive
                    way and forestall its devoting too much of its energy on the “Near Abroad”. A
                    few years later, the orientation would shift, and we would focus more on
                    providing “concrete assistance” — giving grants, building schools (including
                    business schools) and other practical support as well as opportunities for their
                    people to come here for training. In some ways we felt as though we were helping
                    to give birth — delivering countries rather than individuals.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: To '93. In the summer of '93, I embarked on my next assignment, which
                    was Pearson Fellowship with the Asia Foundation in San Francisco.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, could you explain what the Pearson was and then what
                        you did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: The Pearson Fellowship Program was named for a former Senator who sought
                    to foster better ties and understanding between the Department and the Congress
                    or in a broader sense to build bridges between the Executive and Legislatives
                    branches. So a program was established — I no longer recall when it was set up —
                    that provided a one-year assignment for Foreign Service officers (other
                    government agencies subsequently became involved in the program as well) working
                    on the Hill. Actually, there were from the outset two types of programs, one of
                    which presupposed you would spend a six-month period working on the House side
                    and a similar term in the Senate. The other program included an academic
                    component wherein one would spend a semester at Johns Hopkins (SAIS) in
                    Washington or some other academic institution in the vicinity taking relevant
                    courses and then work for a congressman or a staff committee for the remainder
                    of the tour. The initial Pearson Program was strictly focused on links to
                    Congress, with a dozen to 20 people participating each year. Over time, the
                    program evolved and came to include other governmental or quasi-governmental .
                    In other words, there began to be Pearson Fellowships for assignments to
                    municipal governments, such as a tour in the office of the Mayor of San
                    Francisco. Then it expanded further to encompass a few associations and
                    non-governmental organizations. These groups would have to apply to obtain a
                    Pearson Fellow for their staff and commit to paying the associated
                    administrative costs for the officer selected; however, the Department would
                    continue to pay the basic salary.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>By the time I became a Fellow, the program had expanded well beyond the Congress,
                    and there were Pearsons in a number of American cities and at various
                    organizations. When I applied for a Pearson, and specifically for an assignment
                    with the Asia Foundation in San Francisco, I really did not expect to be
                    selected because although I had considerable knowledge about the former Soviet
                    Union and Eastern Europe, I was certainly no expert on Asia. However, it turned
                    out the Foundation was not at that moment looking for another China hand but
                    rather someone who was familiar with the Central Asian region of the former
                    Soviet Union, and for good reasons because it was then considering whether to
                    expand the Foundation's programming into that area. In the end, I was selected
                    to spend a year in San Francisco as a Pearson Fellow for The Asia Foundation.

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be from '93 to '94?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: That is right, from the summer of '93 to the summer of '94. As you can
                    imagine, being unaware of the Foundation's emerging interest in Central Asia, I
                    was somewhat surprised at being chosen. Subsequently, I discovered that aside
                    from their substantive interest in the former Soviet Republics, the leadership
                    of the Foundation regarded me as having some “accidental pluses” I was unaware
                    of. It turned out that the then president of The Asia Foundation was an alumnus
                    of my graduate school and very attached to the school. d so-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your graduate school being?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Stanford. So, having attended Stanford, he probably viewed my having
                    studied there as a positive as well. Then, too, it turned out that the person
                    who was to be my supervisor had attended college at Hamilton College, the small
                    liberal arts school in upstate New York, where I had earlier taught. I imagine
                    that this, too, was seen as a plus. In any case, it was a nice match for all
                    concerned, and working at The Asia Foundation was a fascinating experience for
                    me in many respects.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I Okay, what were they doing and what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: Okay. The Asia Foundation had a number of different programs such as
                    democracy promotion, good governance, rule of law and a book program involving
                    the shipping of books all over Asia — to mention but a few. Actually Asia
                    Foundation had an interesting history. It was founded right after World War II,
                    during the Cold War, initially as a vehicle to combat the spread of communism in
                    Asia. In its early days, the Foundation wound up accepting some funding from the
                    CIA, which became a problem in the '60s when this became public knowledge.
                    Thereafter, The Asia Foundation (TAF) resolved not to accept any more money from
                    the Agency, and no longer did so. Subsequently, TAF received funding from AID
                    and other USG agencies, but its prior associating somewhat tarnished its
                    reputation for a time, with TAF having to fight the impression in some quarters
                    of being an offshoot of the Agency. I think this is no longer an issue, merely a
                    part of the Foundation's history. Anyway, TAF now has programs in many Asian
                    countries, with resident representatives and staffs throughout the region. It's
                    a very responsible organization.</p>
                <p>When I came onboard they were not only working on their usual range of democracy
                    programs, but also on a relatively new conflict resolution project, which I
                    unexpectedly got involved in. But initially, my work centered on carrying out an
                    assessment of whether or not it was feasible or made sense for TAF to become
                    more actively involved in Central Asia. I researched the topic, provided my own
                    analysis, and prepared a recommendation to the effect that if resources were no
                    obstacle, much could be done; however, given limited resources, there were a few
                    things that could be done that would not be very costly and could be played out
                    over a longer term. This way they would not have to plunge into Central Asia
                    where as an institution TAF did not necessarily have a comparative advantage but
                    could instead undertake relatively low cost efforts such as such as expanding
                    their book program into the region or invite Central Asians to conferences that
                    TAF was sponsoring and thereby make itself more widely known. And, fact, TAF did
                    invite several prominent Central Asians to a conflict resolution conference
                    being held during that period as well as invite visiting dignitaries from
                    Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan to stop by the Asia Foundation when they were in town.
                    These were among the recommendations I contributed as part of my assignment.
                    .</p>
                <p>One very interesting and unexpected aspect of this assignment was the fact that I
                    was allowed to work on the preparations for various conferences that TAF
                    sponsored. For example, I worked on a conference held in Korea that dealt with
                    various aspects of the democratization process. For that conference, I served as
                    notetaker and had the opportunity to really see how this type of NGO functioned.
                    On a separate track, TAF hosted a conflict resolution and culture conference,
                    which was quite complicated both in terms of organization and content, that was
                    held in Malaysia and involved three different host organizations. And once
                    again, I was able to participate fully.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the value of these
                        conferences?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: I questioned it on a certain level. However, I was well aware that I was
                    fairly new to the “conference scene”. Later in my career, I would see many more
                    conferences and could better assess their value. The TAF conferences I attended
                    were very professional. But in some respects the value was mixed — in other
                    words a qualified positive but perhaps also a qualified negative. On the
                    negative side, such conferences do tend to resemble other academic conferences
                    where people come together with professional counterparts and present papers
                    which eventually are assembled into a book. As a concept, it's not terribly
                    original or new. And yet, if that book appears in certain areas or reaches
                    reading audiences that normally do not have the opportunity to talk about
                    democracy, freedom or how to change their societies, then perhaps there is truly
                    some positive impact. For example, there were people at that conference who had
                    come out of China — remember this was more than a decade ago when the situation
                    there was quite different — and it may have been an eye opener for them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which conference?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: The democracy one first.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the one in Seoul?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Actually, it was not in Seoul but in a historical city in the south
                    eastern corner of Korea, whose name is almost indistinguishable from another
                    Korean city in the center of the country. But this was the medieval capital,
                    with incredible burial mounds and preserved art works. In any case, we're
                    talking about late '93 or early '94, and the participants were quite open in
                    discussing the problems in China and elsewhere in the region. The Chinese
                    participants seemed to respond quite positively to the free flowing
                    conversations taking place around them. In other words, there was an easy
                    exchange of ideas and information, including discussions about concepts such as
                    the “value” of corruption in moving certain societies forward (greasing the
                    wheels in effect). It was eye-opening even for us because the notion that
                    corruption can have a positive value up to a point is not an idea we normally
                    would subscribe to. Likewise, there was considerable talk of alternatives.
                    Singapore, for example did not have much corruption, but it was certainly not
                    democratic either. So the exchange of contacts, the exchange of views and the
                    inclusion of people from more repressive societies was definitely
                    worthwhile.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the powers that be within the

                </p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: My exposure was quite positive. When you are only on an assignment for a
                    relatively short period, you do not necessarily see the internal problems of an
                    organization. The management was definitely practical, realistic and seeking to
                    do the best work possible and attain achievable goals. The conflict resolution
                    conference, moreover, would demonstrate additional qualities or a different side
                    of the leadership, namely that in addition to be generally effective, TAF
                    leadership was wiling to push the envelope a little, to try different approaches
                    that were beyond the usual or standard operating procedure for an NGO. In this
                    instance, undertaking a somewhat unusual conflict resolution conference cohosted
                    by an Australian university, a Malaysian group, and TAF which sought to meld
                    together both theoreticians and practitioners was a very complicated endeavor
                    and not part of TAF's usual modus operandi.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find yourself, I mean, you are coming out of
                        the Foreign Service world where you can call yourself, you know, you might
                        say the real world; I am not trying to put pejorative or non-pejorative
                        terms on it, but the academic world, and this is a mellowing _______________
                        where there are theories and often somebody has dealt with it says that is a
                        fine theory but it will not work, you know, I mean, did you find yourself
                        siding with the practitioners as opposed to the theorists or did you- how
                        did you find this world?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: That is a good question. As you noted, I had come out of the academic
                    world some time before, but by this point I tended to question more the overall
                    value of conferences from the standpoint of how do they help the average
                    Malaysian or people in general. Certain aspects of the democracy conference gave
                    rise to this type of questioning — more so than in the case of the conflict
                    resolution conference, which had a number of practical aspects. And yet, even
                    the democracy conference was a positive endeavor, resulting in good literature
                    and actually a conference book, which I had a role in producing, and definitely
                    seemed to have real merit for the participants from China and other repressive
                    societies. The other conference, while quite idealistic in orientation, included
                    exercises that drew from Maoris and other societies, whereby we could learn how
                    they handled day-to-day conflicts in their villages and larger communities.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Yes. We considered how the indigenous tribes in a particular area
                    handled certain problems, and in so doing, we mixed and matched theoreticians
                    with practitioners — indeed the conference included a variety of practitioners
                    from all sorts of unusual groups as well as representatives from parties in
                    conflict such as the Tamils and Sinhalese of Sri Lanka. While it may not have
                    been completely successful, I could see real possibilities emerging form the
                    process.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well of course a lot of these programs are designed,
                        really two things; one, to open people's minds to different ways and the
                        other one is to make contact with people. You go to these conferences and
                        here are people who have maybe been rather isolated and finding people of
                        like thought in other places and this is probably the great value, do you
                        not thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: That's true. The organizers produced widely distributed lists, not only
                    of the participants and their organizations but also relevant associations and
                    groups, as well as how to contact and even deal with them. Plus there was the
                    wonderful camaraderie of like-minded souls all gathered together; from that
                    standpoint alone it was a huge success. Personally, I found it very educational
                    and learned a great deal. As to what this all contributed to the greater good is
                    hard to say or to quantify. In my case, I later wound up in a job that required
                    my working on Asian issues, and I was able to draw from what I learned from
                    these conferences and other TAF activities.</p>

                        Administration fairly early on. How it was doing Asia-wise?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Being in San Francisco, the concerns were slightly different. There, the
                    main issue continued to be funding. Our focus was perhaps narrower or more
                    myopic but we tended to focus or worry about whether the USG would fund this or
                    that particular program. That said, as a result of the conflict resolution
                    conference — and this in a way answers your question — TAF applied for grants to
                    continue its work in this field. I personally worked on a grant proposal which
                    was approved.. This somewhat of a circular answer but there was definitely an
                    openness in that period and a willingness to try new programs that might prove
                    beneficial. The environment was certainly more open than today.</p>

                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: Before leaving this topic, there was one sideline to this assignment
                    that probably is worth mentioning, namely the expectations of the Department
                    that I should combine my work at The Asia Foundation with certain tasks directly
                    of benefit to the Department such as informal recruiting, visiting various
                    colleges in the area and giving speeches or talking about Foreign Service life,
                    plus simply making myself available to groups or individuals wanting to know
                    more about the career. For example, a former supervisor of mine was during this
                    period a Pearson at Stanford's Hoover Institution. Knowing that I was in the
                    area and also that George Shultz (then at Hoover) remained interested in hearing
                    the latest word on Georgia, he invited me down to brief the former Secretary. We
                    wound up having an excellent discussion that led Shultz to tell me that he would
                    soon be having a meeting with some young Georgian students and to invite me to
                    talk to them about U.S. - Georgian relations. So, I was still fulfilling a
                    certain amount of my role as a State Department officer. During the course of my
                    year in San Francisco, the TAF leadership graciously asked if I could extend for
                    a second year. I would have welcomed the opportunity, but the Department
                    effectively said one year of living the good life in San Francisco was enough. I
                    should probably mention that the Pearson assignment also allowed me to visit
                    half a dozen countries as a result of various TAF projects. .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you do any recruiting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I did — in the sense of going to Berkeley, San Francisco State, and
                    Stanford, as well as several other schools to talk about life in the Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of my colleagues here, Les McBee, was diplomat in
                        residence at Berkeley, just came back from that, and said he went to
                        Stanford to do some recruiting and found it- sort of a brick wall because
                        almost everybody there would say well, how much do you make. There was not
                        much interest at all in what you might call public service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Well, Stanford may have gone through another cycle but there was a
                    period, somewhat of a brief window when event the so-called “Stanford farm” was,
                    if not radicalized a la Berkeley, then at least quite civic minded or socially
                    conscious.</p>
                <p>But, in any event, I soon had to return to the cycle of bidding on normal tours
                    of duty. In fact, that had started even before I went out to California because
                    the bidding cycle in effect begins sometimes more than a year in advance. In my
                    case, I found out after I arrived in San Francisco that I would next go to Rio
                    de Janeiro, by way of a short course in Portuguese. Consequently, after leaving
                    California in the summer of 1994, I came back here to Washington and spent three
                    or four months at our Foreign Service Institute studying Portuguese. And in
                    December of 1994, I headed down to Rio.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I was there for two and a half years, from December 1994 to the summer
                    of 1997. The reason for this slightly unusual period is that I curtailed my tour
                    by a few months in order to get onto what was called the summer cycle for the
                    Department, since most jobs become available then. .</p>

                        you know, Eastern Bloc.</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is tape five, side one with Nadia Tongour.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: When I went out to San Francisco, it was just a year and a half, and we
                    left a year later. While I was well aware that from a career standpoint it would
                    make sense to go next to Georgia or Moldova or elsewhere in Eastern Europe, I
                    thought it might be very difficult from a family perspective. So I consciously
                    bid on assignments that I thought would be satisfying and that would allow for
                    nanny care and all that goes with it. Having already served in Latin America (my
                    first posting in Mexico) and done a stint in the Caribbean, I was not out of the
                    question as a candidate for an ARA, now WHA (Western Hemisphere Affairs),
                    posting. And the other part of it was that Rio de Janeiro was at that time one
                    of our largest consulates, having something on the order of 70 American direct
                    hires and a much larger contingent of Foreign Service Nationals (FSNs);
                    nevertheless, it was a consulate and many ambitious officers would have had
                    second thoughts about serving in such a post. In a way that might have been a
                    mistake for those who wrote of Rio or Sao Paulo because Rio had long been the
                    political capital of the country and many of the most prominent Brazilians, the
                    movers and shakers, still tended to scorn the inland capital of Brasilia, which
                    then still lacked charm, and spent as much time as possible in their home cities
                    of Rio or Sao Paulo. In other words, Brazilian political leaders of that period
                    had somewhat of a commuter existence, spending Tuesdays through Thursdays in
                    Brasilia and the remainder of the week and all holidays in their home cities.
                    For political officers this was wonderful in that we gained access to many
                    officials who might have been too busy to see political officers in Brasilia
                    since their time there was devoted to attending congressional sessions or other
                    required activities. Back home, however, they tended to be more relaxed and
                    accessible to us. Of course, Rio was a beautiful city to live in, with numerous
                    advantages as well as some drawbacks.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I was the senior political officer. We had a combined pol-econ section.
                    I actually wound up running the section for about seven or eight months during a
                    staffing gap, and for a month or two I served as Acting Consul General, again
                    because of a gap between the former and prospective Consul General.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were the Consul Generals when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: My first year the CG was David Zweifel, who subsequently retired from
                    the Foreign Service, but may still be around doing WAE work. Subsequently, James
                    (Jim) Derham took over. He spent a number of years in and out of Brazil and the
                    region as a whole and most recently was our Ambassador to Guatemala.</p>
                <p>So, as a political officer, what did I do? The Consulate covered five states in
                    Brazil. Many people do not realize that Brazil is larger than the land mass of
                    the lower 48 United States. Consequently, it was comparable to covering the
                    Eastern Seaboard of the U.S. During that period, there were numerous elections —
                    municipal, local and state — and I would do the normal political reporting on
                    these. I had contacts across the spectrum of society in Rio and met with
                    political and societal leaders. . I was very active in recommending people for
                    visitor programs, the so-called International Visitor Program as well as other
                    grants. Of course there was considerable reporting on drugs, crime, and street
                    children which represented a major social issue. I also dealt extensively with
                    various NGOs in the society and worked closely with them, providing whatever
                    assistance we could. CODELs, congressional delegations — we had a lot of them,
                    some more credible than others. One such CODEL which I will never forget — the
                    head of which is still a congressman — managed to time its visit for Easter week
                    where there was absolutely nothing in terms of work going on. The members were
                    was absolutely appalled that most of the jewelry stores would not open just for
                    their visit. I remember accompanying this CODEL to a fancy restaurant and a
                    reporter and cameraman showed up from the local press; the head of the
                    delegation was outraged that the media had been allowed to show up and he
                    actually raged at us because he assumed the Consulate had permitted or even
                    encouraged the press to appear. His main concern was that his constituents would
                    not like to see him out gallivanting around Rio in this way, and the pictures
                    might get out.</p>

                <p>TONGOUR: He was one of the Burtons (Dan, I think) from the Midwest, and he still
                    rants quite a bit. I heard him on the news just recently bashing a critic and
                    calling him a liar. I found myself thinking about “pots and kettles”. In any
                    case we had our share of people like that, and we definitely organized meetings,
                    trips and other outings for them — as well as the obligatory jewelry stores.
                    Still it was a fascinating experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the government of Brazil like at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Well, the government was one we were quite keen on. Traditionally,
                    Brazil had a policy of one-term presidents; reelections were not allowed, until
                    the presidency of Cardoso who was at the help at that time. An amendment to
                    allow for re-election of the president was a major development of the period.
                    Cardoso, the immediate predecessor to the incumbent Luis (Lula) Ignacio da
                    Silva, was considered a moderate reform-minded president who, in fact, succeeded
                    in more or less stabilizing the currency, a phenomenal achievement given that
                    Brazil had had skyrocketing inflation on and off for decades with tragic
                    consequences for the country. Just before I arrived there was a shift to a new
                    currency, the “Real”, which at least initially was more or less pegged to the
                    dollar, with an exchange rate that fluctuated but for some time stayed fairly
                    close to a one to one rate. The Real was fairly popular and remains the currency
                    still. In any case, the Brazilians amended their constitutions, thereby allowing
                    Cardoso and subsequent presidents to run for re-election. Overall, it was a
                    positive period. There were inevitable disagreements but we were very favorably
                    disposed toward Cardoso's administration.</p>

                    skeptical about the United States. The problem in Brazil is that while
                    traditionally the Brazilian left, including the Workers' Party (PT) , for
                    example, that current President Lula comes from, had its share of corruption and
                    problems, these were nothing compared to the kinds of shenanigans that the more
                    right wing parties were involved with. Moreover, since the right wing parties
                    had traditionally been associated with the dictatorship that had controlled
                    Brazil for many years and were also the parties of the landed aristocracy or the
                    ranchers in the Amazon, timber cutters — in other words forces that were not
                    environmentally-friendly or progressive — they tended to be more sympathetic to
                    the U.S. For our part we were sometimes ambivalent, and to use the old clich�,
                    we sometimes held our noses when dealing with some of the less savory groups,
                    viewing them in some instances as the lesser evil. In other words, the USG as a
                    whole was still uncomfortable with Latin American leftist entities. We have
                    grown much more comfortable with Lula in recent years but then our government
                    was still less than thrilled with the idea of some of these leftists coming to
                    power. Now the history of the Brazilian left is quite rich and colorful and
                    includes members of what was known as the Sim Terra Movement which supports
                    landless workers. This group did not exactly embrace the policies of the USG. I
                    would have to say that personally speaking, one great satisfaction came from
                    being able to travel to some outlying areas and actually meet some Sim Terra
                    members — when they were willing to meet with me. I felt that when they were
                    willing to meet and share their views, it was a real breakthrough and I learned
                    a great deal about what they were working on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you sense that the leftist movement was interested in
                        what was happening in the United States or were they sort of almost
                        genetically forms of suspicious or opposed to it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Both. I think they were suspicious and “genetically” predisposed to
                    oppose us. On the other hand they are educated. I mean, for the most part they
                    came from the educated elite. One sad aspect related to the Brazilian left is
                    the continuing dichotomy between the extremely poor and extremely rich. This is
                    not some figment of someone's imagination. Yet, the people who tended to be the
                    leftists, with rare exception — a few did work their way up the ranks — were
                    children of fairly comfortable, if not outright affluent parents, who read and
                    kept up and knew what was happening in the outside world. They did not
                    necessarily dislike the United States as an entity but they certainly were not
                    predisposed toward the U.S. government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your area were there any sort of crises or anything, at
                        least from your perspective, that you had to deal with?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: Crises is probably too strong a word because essentially the kinds of
                    things that were of interest to Washington revolved around issues of
                    narco-trafficking, corruption and how to make our assistance more effective. We
                    were concerned about fighting crime and narco-traffickers and wanted to support
                    the police;; at the same time, cops were involved in the killing of street
                    children. The quandary we faced was how to help people who might be doing good
                    on one front when some of those very people were not necessarily predisposed
                    toward us. These were the types of issues we discussed, namely given limited
                    resources should we send to the United States potential leaders who might now be
                    critical of the U.S, Could they be brought around to understand our viewpoint,
                    etc? I don't think you could say that there were major crises in our
                    relationship with Brazil at that time. To be sure there were various pressures,
                    including from environmental groups and NGOs to take a strong stand on
                    developments in the Amazon or on human rights issues. On the latter, we really
                    did try. I personally met with a lot of NGOs who frequently came in and provided
                    invaluable information on human rights abuses in Brazil. But the problem was
                    that most human rights abuses in Brazil were not officially being carried out by
                    the government of Brazil. What does one do when an off-duty cop — a cop by day,
                    a paid security guard by night — kills kids at night or goes after people who
                    then disappear.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why were they killing people, killing children?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Children were only one small segment. The case that became most famous,
                    the so-called Candelaria Massacre involved the killing of children. But such
                    killings were rare. The disappearances, the rounding up and abuse of victims was
                    more common. A few years before I arrived, there had been what many described as
                    an invasion of locusts, of children and teens roaming the beaches and robbing
                    tourists and others. Officially, the police would clean that up, because after
                    all, for a city such as Rio de Janeiro, tourism is a major industry. So, the
                    police were there to clean up the beaches, and they did. Crime was definitely a
                    problem and the favelas (slums) were breeding grounds for drugs; the police
                    would invade these areas and clean them u. Some of the people rounded up were
                    quite young, but the overt actions of the police were viewed as legitimate. The
                    other aspect, their off-duty work, such as what occurred outside the Candelaria
                    Cathedral in downtown Rio were more brutal — resulting in the killing of
                    children who were literally sleeping in front of the church. Apparently
                    storekeepers in the vicinity did not like to see these children sleeping on the
                    plaza in front of the church. They considered it bad for business. Who paid
                    whom, who did what to whom, was never clarified but eventually some off-duty
                    policemen were tried for the killing of half a dozen or more kids and the
                    wounding of others. The so-called Candelaria Massacre became a visible problem,
                    creating a sense of outrage among the more enlightened members of Brazilian
                    society and the outside world and spawned considerable social activism. One of
                    the people I got to know well in Rio, who was related to the UN Rep Vieira de
                    Melo, was very involved in working with street children after this massacre. She
                    was a woman who came from a very wealthy family. Yet she wound up working with
                    these kids. And I am talking not this street group or that street group; there
                    were thousands of children who are essentially living on the street, living in
                    squalor in cardboard shacks.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where do they come from? In other words, are they
                        disconnected from at least their mother or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Some of them are not disconnected from a mother or other family members.
                    In fact, some come from families that lived in the cardboard shacks. The woman I
                    mentioned invited me to go with her on one of her visitations to see a group of
                    kids she often brought food. Many of them slept under aqueducts or bridges where
                    they created cardboard shantytowns. These children ranged in ages, and sometimes
                    they lived with a parent; thus, they were not always alone. However, the parent
                    might actually have been working somewhere. Alternately, a 10 or 12 year old
                    might well have run away from an abusive situation or be living with one parent
                    in the cardboard shanty, but that parent might be somewhere working as a maid or
                    in some menial profession. Their backgrounds and where they came from was
                    unclear. Many were clearly from rural areas and came to the big city to find
                    work, given their bleak situation elsewhere. Things have gotten better in recent
                    years, but 10-15 years ago there was considerable poverty and many such squatter
                    settlements. Then, too, there were many favela kids who would come down from the
                    hills to sell “whatever” (Chiclets and odds and ends) on the streets. Sometimes
                    these were runaways from abusive situations, but often they would simply leave
                    their favelas during the day and return at night. The worst off had no where to
                    go and simply slept under any available arcade in downtown Rio. One could spot
                    them any evening when walking around the city; they would be sleeping on the
                    sidewalks, under building arcades if they were lucky. Fortunately, the climate
                    in Rio is generally mild so this is feasible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well talking about this, how did you find living in Rio?
                        How was the living there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: I loved it. I loved it notwithstanding what I've just been saying about
                    the dichotomy between the haves and have-nots. You know, it is a beautiful
                    country and a beautiful city. I used to jokingly say that God was kind to Rio
                    but man made a mess of it. I lived in a wonderful old apartment overlooking the
                    sea and facing the famous Sugarloaf Mountain and I could also see the statue of
                    Christ out of the corner as well as gorgeous scenery all around. The apartment
                    was in a previously very fashionable neighborhood on a still highly desirable
                    street. It's always dangerous to generalize about a nationality but I must admit
                    that I generally found Brazilians to be very nice, regardless of their class or
                    educational level. They tended to be warm, friendly and fun. In short, I got to
                    know many people, a cross-section of society and seemed to be invited
                    everywhere. The Consulate as a whole had excellent access. I personally traveled
                    all over the country. However, it is true that one can develop a somewhat
                    distorted view after a while and stop being “shocked” at the visible social
                    problems. That's one reason why it was good to go out with the woman I was
                    telling you about and meet others like her; otherwise, it would be too easy to
                    stop seeing the whole picture. I remember a dear friend of mine visiting me from
                    the U.S., and I took her to a town about 40 miles away, a beautiful hill town
                    called Petropolis, which was the traditional summer home of Brazilian royalty in
                    the old days. We drove for some miles through poor areas, with low-lying favelas
                    interspersed with trashy tire shops and grungy small businesses and after a
                    while she asked “doesn't this bother you?” And DI asked “what?”. She replied:
                    “All this poverty.” One does get a bit inured after a while or at least stop
                    really seeing that clearly. I think this becomes a danger for the upper classes
                    who live phenomenally well, who are educated, cultured and basically have
                    everything — and then there are the rest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I do not know, a phenomenon which may have gone
                        away, but I have talked to people who served in Rio during the '50s and '60s
                        and all and said particularly the men began to pick up the habits of the
                        locals, where all of a sudden they were, you know, this was at the embassy
                        at the time, they sort of had mistresses and all this. I mean, this became
                        quite prevalent and a real shock. Was this still going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Well, I am sure some may have but if so, people were discreet. Like
                    anywhere else, there were divorces and people who remarried locals. But another
                    aspect of life in Brazil that is worth mentioning centers on the social side,
                    notably Carnival. Anyone visiting Brazil during that season would invariably
                    describe it as an enjoyable experience, with Carnival being wonderfully fun,
                    colorful and unique. Undoubtedly, they would also mention the incredible amount
                    of near nudity; some would wonder how this would square with the fact that
                    Brazil is a predominantly Catholic country. I think one particularly noteworthy
                    characteristic of Brazilians is that they seem much more comfortable in their
                    own skin than most of us are. I don't mean to say that every Brazilian is
                    beautiful, but rather as a generality, they seem much more relaxed about their
                    bodies or less insecure in that regard.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well speaking about skin, the Brazilians talk about being
                        sort of not racially motivated but I am told by those Americans who go
                        there, particularly those of some color or observant found that they are
                        very racially stratified.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I am glad you brought this up because, in fact, this may be one of the
                    less attractive features of the country, which is ironic because many tend to
                    think of Brazil as a racially mixed paradise. The situation is not quite that
                    simple or straightforward, and, in fact, sometimes even seems paradoxical. I
                    recall an incident that occurred during the visit of a popular American gospel
                    group Sweet Honey in the Rock which performed in Rio and had clearly not done
                    its “homework” on the issue of race in Brazil.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes, it's a famous group.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Yes, it is. During her opening remarks, the leader of the group began
                    the program by gushing about the racial harmony in Brazil and how wonderful it
                    was to be in this racial paradise. The audience did not boo her but made sounds
                    indicating their lack of acceptance of her interpretation. And it was a very
                    racially mixed audience. Now most Brazilians would be quick to assert that they
                    are not racists, that Brazil is not a racist society but rather that it is
                    class-based, and admitted highly economically stratified in such a way that if
                    you are successful, you are considered white. There is no caste system, and
                    Brazilians correctly maintain that there is certainly greater fluidity than in
                    the American South, where historically even the smallest percentage of “black
                    blood” would define you as black. In Brazil, if Pel�, the soccer star, wanted to
                    consider himself white he would be white. But what they did have and what they
                    probably still do have is an informal type of segregation in certain quarters —
                    separate facilities such as “service elevators” for those who do not dress a
                    certain way or look as if they don't “belong”. An African-American Foreign
                    Service Officer gave me an excellent and irksome example of this. She noted that
                    if I entered an apartment building wearing grubbies, no one would ask me to take
                    the service elevator but if she, who happened to be our Cultural Affairs
                    Officer, was having a “bad hair day” or simply casually dressed, she might be
                    asked to take the service elevator. So the Brazilian view is that there are
                    strong class distinctions based on economic development, not race. That said,
                    there is a lot of emphasis on being white. Another example comes to mind. I had
                    as nanny for my son a beautiful young woman who could be described as “caf� au
                    lait” in color but she always insisted she was white, while noting that her
                    grandmother was not. She was quick to emphasize this distinction, and she was
                    far from alone in this regard.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a political officer, how important was the church?
                        Maybe not the Catholic Church but also maybe the Evangelical Church. I mean,
                        what was going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: Oh, religion was definitely an important theme while I was there. First
                    of all, on the Catholic side there was essentially — not exactly a schism which
                    would be too drastic a term in the Brazilian context — a division within the
                    ranks. Actually there were at least three types of Catholics: the totally
                    non-practicing; the casual “I was born a Catholic but not really involved types”
                    which I'm not really considering at this point, as well as the activists who
                    themselves were divided. On the one hand there were the more conservative,
                    traditional Catholics, some of whom would be comfortable with the Opus Dei crowd
                    in Mexico, but perhaps a bit more liberal. On the other hand, you had the
                    “worker priest” types, activists who generally espoused some form of “liberation
                    theology”; this group also included many of the Bishops of Brazil. In fact, the
                    ranks of Brazilian Bishops were also split between the more conservative and
                    activist wings. The sense among those who followed religious issues was that the
                    worker priest tradition in Brazil was basically quite admirable. Again, these
                    more leftist priests might not be politically to the our liking but they were
                    sincere in their commitment to social justice and so on, whereas the other group
                    was more traditional and possibly more venal, if you will, in terms of how they
                    lived. The predominance of the more traditional Catholicism in a way served as a
                    catalyst for the growth of Evangelical Movements, partly in reaction to
                    perceived flaws in the more established Catholic Church. The Evangelicals really
                    stressed “moral behavior” and toe-ing the line with regard to not drinking,
                    working hard and making something of oneself. In fact, the of Evangelical
                    emphasis on getting ahead and prospering was phenomenally popular. I became
                    acquainted with several young people who were working on the management side of
                    one of these Evangelical groups. This group had radio stations, classes,
                    churches throughout the country and abroad — including Florida for Brazilians
                    who had moved there. It was a major enterprise as well as a way for many people
                    to put their lives in some sort of order. Very often the ones most drawn to the
                    Evangelical movement were the poor as well as those who had previously had major
                    alcohol or drug problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this translated beyond the personal lives into
                        political movements?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Yes, but I would not call it a “movement” at least at that point in
                    time. However, I do recall that one so-called Evangelical candidate was elected
                    either Mayor of Rio de Janeiro or perhaps even Rio State Governor after I had
                    left, and he had been a very effective “preacher man” earlier in his career. In
                    addition, I know there were candidates in other states that were running for
                    various offices essentially as Evangelicals — somewhat along the lines of the
                    recent Huckabee candidacy here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that sort of a ruling or the establishment,
                        the white establishment and all was getting kind of nervous about the
                        Evangelical movement and the left wing, I mean, things that Lula came out of
                        or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Well, Lula was not an Evangelical.</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was not an Evangelical but I mean, you know, I am

                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Certainly, certainly. But again, for different reasons. Most leftist
                    politicians were not Evangelicals; if they had any strong religious background,
                    it would more likely be of the “worker priest”, “liberation theology”
                    traditions. That said, the Evangelicals were somewhat of a threat to many of the
                    more established, traditional politicians. The left, at least, was viewed as a
                    known threat. They had already had to deal with the left in the past and knew
                    where leftists were coming from, but they really were uncertain about where this
                    new Evangelical fervor would lead to politically.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find, as sort of the top political reporter
                        that the consular general- was there a problem in breaking loose from the
                        sort of embrace of the wealthy, the glittering class and all that or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: The first Consul General I served under was very well connected to what
                    you term the “glitterati”. The second, Jim Derham, also socialized a great deal
                    but he was an Econ Cone officer and was more interested in seeing the entire
                    economic picture and more curious about different strata of Brazilian society:
                    And I have to say, they both gave me a certain amount of latitude. I recall
                    later rereading my EERs (evaluations) and thinking, did they really let me do
                    this. When visiting dignitaries or CODELs came to town, I would stage different
                    kinds of events for them in addition to traditional CODEL type activities. For
                    example, I set up a visit for our DCM (from Embassy Brasilia) to see a street
                    theater performance, sponsored by an NGO which supported the Transgender and
                    HIV/AID community, including the actors. So, we did on occasion break out of the
                    normal strictures, but sometimes it was hard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, it is very difficult.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: We often received tickets to performances and sometimes we even sat in
                    the Mayor's box at the Opera House and even the Governor's box on occasion. They
                    were our “hosts” which maid it tricky sometimes when we pressed them on human
                    rights issues or other concerns.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I am just looking at time; this is probably a good
                        place to stop. And we will pick this up- think it over, if there is anything
                        else we should talk about while you were in Rio but you left there in '96,
                        was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Ninety-seven, but before we leave I might mention that I received a
                    somewhat unusual award during this period, which probably says something about
                    the extent of my contacts in the community. A Brazilian women's organization,
                    based in Rio, every year honored 10 or so “women of the year” for various
                    contributions both to women and the broader community. Usually a woman diplomat
                    was included in the ranks of those selected and my last year in Brazil, 1997, I
                    was one of the recipients of this award. I have to admit I was touched by the
                    gesture and appreciated my inclusion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ninety-seven. And where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Then I came back to Washington and then I had two back to back
                    Washington tours. My first job back in the Department was in the International
                    Organizations Bureau, in an office then known as Peacekeeping and Humanitarian
                    Operations (PHO). I think the name has changed since then. I marveled sometimes
                    how office names or acronyms often bore little relation or even antithetical to
                    the actual work of the office. When one hears the word “peacekeeping” or
                    “humanitarian operations” one normally would assume that our goal was to promote
                    these ends, and to some extent it was. But, since this was the International
                    Organizations Bureau, our immediate task was to work closely with other
                    government agencies and with our UN Mission to ensure that UN peacekeeping
                    operations were on track with our own overall foreign policy objectives. We did
                    — and we still do — support peacekeeping operations; however our position
                    vis-a-vis these operations was not always identical to that of the UN or other
                    member states. At times we found ourselves in the position of trying to reign in
                    relevant UN offices or attempting either to cut costs or reduce budgets or still
                    more often making sure the budgets were relevant and that our Congress was
                    satisfied with existing peacekeeping operations and so forth.</p>
                <p>But in any case, I came onboard and initially I was given three or four
                    portfolios which were quite interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: Two were in the area that I knew a fair amount about, namely Georgia and
                    Tajikistan, which were both facing serious upheavals, requiring ongoing UN
                    peacekeeping operations or observer missions. The third portfolio I inherited
                    dealt with a part of the world about which I knew very little, namely Africa.
                    The Liberian peacekeeping operation, known as UNOMIL, was winding down and then
                    the question of the day was what would replace it. Until that point, the United
                    States had officially opposed engagement in “nation building/ peace building”
                    operations; our position was to support observer mission and “stop the fighting
                    missions” but as far as out mandate was concerned, we were not in the nation
                    building business. Obviously, the situation today is quite different, and we
                    frequently become involved in such ventures, but then this was still something
                    fairly new. It was somewhat difficult to convince the Pentagon, the NSC and
                    other agencies that support for follow on actions in Liberia geared toward
                    helping the Liberians build their own nation was a good thing — this was
                    something relatively new.</p>
                <p>So in my first year, I handled UNOMIL in Liberia, UNMOT as it was called in
                    Tajikistan and UNOMIG for Georgia. The second year I took on a variety of other
                    portfolios that I had previously “backstopped” or filling in when another
                    officer was away. Consequently, I spent a few months working on Sierra Leone,
                    which was a hot topic at the time; later and in a similar vein, I worked on
                    Haiti, Macedonia and even a bit on Kosovo. One of the things that is both
                    wonderful and sometimes frustrating about this profession is that we often
                    become instant experts. You work on Sierra Leone for two months and suddenly you
                    are the “go-to” person for information about that country — a country which I
                    had known next to nothing about previously. But we do jump in, learn on the job,
                    which sometimes makes for some fascinating experiences. In this case, I learned
                    a lot about generals with colorful names such as General Butt Naked as well as
                    other factoids I had previously not even known existed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let us start, in the first place, when you got
                        there, this is the Clinton Administration which had, as so many
                        administrations wanted, to concentrate on economic conditions within the
                        country and social conditions within the United States and all of a sudden
                        found itself spending an inordinate amount of time on foreign affairs. How
                        would you describe when you arrived in '97 the attitude towards
                        peacekeeping; let us do peacekeeping first and then humanitarian
                        affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: Actually, and unfortunately, we can make short shrift of the
                    humanitarian side of our work. Since I subsequently worked in an office that
                    really did address humanitarian concerns, I can say that our office's mission or
                    the humanitarian component of our work was misnamed and quite limited. I can
                    describe it in a few words and cover the topic quickly because I , for one, did
                    not really have to deal with it; moreover, the office as a whole dealt almost
                    exclusively with Iraq sanctions in our “humanitarian role” Specifically,
                    officers in our section addressed issues of whether or not we would allow
                    humanitarian supplies into the country in that time frame. Little did we know
                    where we would be vis-a-vis Iraq a few years later. Mostly, we were trying to
                    keep things out of the country — that was the humanitarian aspect of the
                    office's work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in the 400 teddy bears or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I personally did not but word of it was certainly circulating. But the
                    real issue for us was the bad PR the USG was getting on account of the question
                    of sanctions. The big concern at that point centered on whether we were keeping
                    food from needy Iraqis and in turn making the situation worse. In short, were we
                    aggravating this “semi-known” despot, named Saddam Hussein by keeping food out.
                    And, of course, there were corruption cases that emerged later involving
                    officials stockpiling or pilfering food that was intended for the people at
                    large.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, even Kofi Annan's son was involved.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: That is right. The details started coming out after I had left the job
                    but obviously this had been taking place earlier. Essentially, as I said, my own
                    involvement in this side of our work was negligible but when one speaks of an
                    office called Peacekeeping and Humanitarian Affairs, one expects a broader
                    humanitarian component.</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>To get back to your point regarding peacekeeping operations, when I first
                    arrived, our biggest concern seemed to be the inflated UN budget and
                    specifically the inflated UN peacekeeping budget with various Congressional
                    leaders tasking us to keep an eye out and ensure that the UN was not wasting our
                    taxpayers money. Congressional committees were seized with the issue of whether
                    these were worthy ventures and something we really should be engaged in.
                    Obviously, there were certain favored countries. For example, there was
                    Congressional interest in Liberia, and likewise, there were groups keen on
                    Georgia. Tajikistan was a much harder sell; we tried to persuade Congress and
                    other USG agencies that observer missions such as UNMOT (Tajikistan) were
                    performing a truly useful function. My boss, for example, had to go up to the
                    Hill every month for what we called an RTW, otherwise known as “Round the
                    World”, basically an overview of what was happening in all the global hot spots.
                    We spent an enormous amount of time briefing him — providing countless papers in
                    the process — so that he could go to the Hill and persuade staffers and the
                    occasional congressman that what was happening was valuable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was your boss?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: My main supervisor, the Office Director for much of this period was
                    Edmund Hull, who subsequently served as our Ambassador to Yemen. I suspect that
                    some variant of these RTWs continues to this day. On my level, I also had to
                    deal with Hill staffers and try to make them understand our actions and
                    policies. One concrete example was somewhat interesting: During my first year,
                    four UN observers in Georgia were briefly kidnapped by one of the various
                    warring factions, a renegade group making it unclear who exactly had taken the
                    observers. You can imagine our sense of outrage since two of the four were
                    Americans. Where were endless questions along the lines of what are our people
                    doing there? Why are we putting our troops in harm's way on a UN peacekeeping
                    operation? Should we even be there? And, of course, there were calls for yanking
                    our people out immediate. We have come a long way on that score, but certain
                    concerns rightly remain. Thus, a great deal of effort was made to try to
                    persuade various other elements in the USG that we could find ways to safeguard
                    the security of these American observers, mainly by keeping them away from
                    particular areas of operation, while simultaneously stressing our support for
                    the new government in Georgia. It seemed critical then to show the Russians we
                    were seriously interested and that we intended to keep peace efforts in play and
                    our people in the region — thereby demonstrating our commitment to the process.
                    I know I later received an award for coming up with some actionable
                    recommendations in this area.</p>

                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: While many of the staffers and the members themselves were perfectly
                    amiable, they were generally not the people that were most interested in a
                    particular country or operation. Those who were most engaged usually came down
                    strongly on one side or another of any given issue. In this instance, there were
                    certainly staffers and congressmen who disapproved of whatever w were doing with
                    regard to Georgia. For example, we were either not doing enough to help the
                    government of Georgia and should not be leaving it to the UN to protect that
                    fledgling nation or we should be out of there altogether — one extreme or the
                    other. .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I would think, I mean, we are not that far, at this
                        time not that far away from the Cold War and not doing anything would
                        basically give a free hand to the Russians to reintegrate, I am not sure
                        that is really an appropriate word, Georgia back into the empire, wouldn't
                        it? I would think that in Cold War terms this would be anathema to
                        Congress.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Absolutely. And that was the prevailing view but the problem of how to
                    help remained — through the UN or not. In other words, some of the harshest
                    critics were advocates of a more unilateral approach or basically some form of
                    “cowboy diplomacy” wherein we should get in there to help the Georgians and to
                    hell with the UN, to put it crudely. In other words, there were definitely
                    proponents of direct assistance to the Georgian government instead of playing
                    the “neutral observer” role via the UN.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find yourself bumping heads with what later
                        or maybe at the time but certainly became a major force during the Bush 2
                        administration, the neocons, I mean. , Was this part of their movement of
                        disliking the UN and wanting to go and do things ourselves or was this in
                        play at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Well, they certainly felt that way and there certainly were voices in
                    Congress that were consistently antithetical to the UN but...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the first place, were you up against Jesse Helms and
                        his staff particularly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: They were definitely critical and ever present. I had forgotten about
                    this, but yes, Helms staffers seemed ubiquitous and whatever the group we had to
                    address Helms staffer X would be there and pressing certain buttons. On the
                    other hand, there were a few staffers that either had strong feelings about or
                    their bosses did regarding Shevardnadze and endlessly grilled us about what we
                    were doing to help Georgia.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Shevardnadze was a major figure and he became sort of the
                        darling boy of our foreign policy on the collapse of the Soviet Union which
                        carried over into Georgia where he was a hell of a lot more popular in the
                        United States than he was in Georgia, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: That is true. But working on Georgia was relatively easy compared to
                    some of the other peacekeeping missions because people genuinely cared about
                    Georgia; therefore, we had, apart from the kidnapping case I previously
                    mentioned, considerable support for our involvement there. Our problems were in
                    cases or countries that staffers either did not care about or knew less of. For
                    example, we had to work hard to “sell” the peacekeeping operation in Tajikistan
                    where warlord factions were all over the map, including groups coming out of
                    Afghanistan. In some ways, it truly resembled the Wild West. The organization
                    the UN had in place there was called UNMOT, and compared to many peacekeeping
                    efforts, it was a low budget. Yet, the UNMOT forces were in very dangerous
                    territory, similar to the mountainous regions of Afghanistan. There were tribal
                    leaders killing each other with great abandon and at least three or four
                    separate armed forces fighting the so-called central government — yet this small
                    UNMOT force was expected to keep the peace. .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were we seeing as the danger by these- I mean, okay,
                        they are fighting up in the hills but this is before the Taliban, well, not
                        even Taliban but the Al Qaeda and the sort of terrorist thing; we were
                        seeing this as a potential terrorist thing or is this just they should not
                        be fighting each other?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: We weren't using the term “terrorism” then, at least not in that
                    context. What existed was a weak central government of Tajikistan lead by an
                    old-style, typical former Soviet bureaucrat confronting various competing armed
                    factions plus some emerging democratic elements. Theoretically, they agreed to
                    hold elections, with these different factions also technically agreeing to make
                    peace rather than tear apart the country, thereby making any form of democracy
                    impossible. UNMOT was supposedly there to help facilitate the peace. Yet, there
                    were elements within the USG that questioned why we were bothering. And we had
                    to try to persuade them that this low budget operation could be carried out to
                    the benefit of all involved and prevent the country from becoming yet another
                    hot spot in the former Soviet Union. In other words, we did not have an ax to
                    grind in this struggle, nor any particular vested interest beyond moving some
                    form of national self-determination or democratic process along. Interestingly
                    enough we did come up with a low budget proposal for actual force protection,
                    which was definitely warranted inasmuch as some of these UNMOT troops were
                    getting killed. Essentially, the plan was to have the various warring factions
                    that had nominally agreed to peace to protect their protectors. In other words,
                    if you had UN observers on the ground, this was definitely a place where force
                    protection was needed. After all, UNMOT was an unarmed observer mission whose
                    observers needed protectors. The issue, therefore, was who would protect them?
                    Should we send another team of armed UN troops to carry out this role? Did that
                    make any sense? This was the type of discussion that went on endlessly. We were
                    well aware that by tripling the size of the operation (with armed protectors),
                    we would triple the cost. So, we came up with the idea of making the factions
                    live up to their obligations by committing themselves to protecting the UN
                    observers.</p>
                <p>Ultimately, they agreed to do so — nominally at least, with the main factional
                    leaders agreeing to provide protection to the UN observers. On the face of it,
                    this might be seen as an absurd situation but it more or less worked for a
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in a way, and I am not using this in a pejorative
                        sense because it is often used throughout history, we were paying these
                        people not to fight.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: That is exactly right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And I mean, that is what it was all about anyway.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Yes. It also made for an interesting assignment with a great deal of
                    variety given that there were so many different and ongoing operations at the
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, well let us turn to Sierra Leone. What was going on
                        and what were we doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: I became involved in this mission late in the game where there was
                    suddenly a need for speedy action. This was one of those instances where we were
                    smart, collectively, in realizing that we could not do everything on our own.
                    Since Sierra Leone had previously been a British colony, the Brits retained a
                    strong interest there and we recognized the need to work closely with them, and
                    we did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was basically philosophically and practically their
                        Liberia. I mean, both were places where they hoped to send Liberia named
                        Liberia and Freetown was named- I mean, this is where- each country sent
                        their freed slaves if they could to get rid of the problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: So we cooperated with the Brits in developing strategies for low cost
                    ways to work in the area and to encourage the African Union and others to send
                    in observers and peacekeepers to put an end to the massacres.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the massacres about? Was this a spillover of
                        Charles Taylor's Liberian business or was this indigenous?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: All of the above with some diamonds thrown in for good measure. I make
                    no pretense at being an expert on Liberia or Sierra Leone, even though I had to
                    learn a great deal quickly. There were clearly various local factions, and like
                    Liberia, under colorfully named generals or leaders, many of whom were quite
                    young but who engaged in a fairly brutal conflict including the cutting off of
                    limbs and other bodily parts. It was horrible. They did not always kill their
                    victims — or each other — and the country was filled with amputees who had lost
                    one or another limb to a rival faction, often aided and abetted by Charles
                    Taylor and company. It is difficult for me to know, regarding some of these
                    internal conflicts — not being an Africanist — how much had to do with ethnic or
                    tribal disputes and how much was simply a power conflict. In any case, we worked
                    very closely with the Brits who, in fact, took the lead in trying to bring in
                    the African Union to help out in Sierra Leone.</p>
                <p>As a side note, I might mention a very interesting program known as the
                    Fellowship of Hope (actually, it had a different name during that period)
                    whereby diplomats from friendly or allied countries would spend a year working
                    in the State Department and our FSOs would similarly spend a year in the Dutch,
                    British, or other foreign ministries. The reason I bring this up at this time is
                    that a young man who represented the British Embassy at our various discussions
                    on Sierra Leone had his own State Department badge due to the fact that he had
                    spent the previous year working on our Japan Desk as part of this exchange
                    program and totally knew his way around our building and our world; consequently
                    not surprisingly, it was a very amicable working relationship.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Liberia, was this also under your-?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I worked on Liberia at the beginning of the tour. It was part of my
                    portfolio but UNOMIL was wrapping up when I started the assignment. So my work
                    was sort of a “mop up” role, dealing with administrative issues and questions
                    related to ensuring that prior peacekeeping efforts held and Liberia remained at
                    peace.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you get any feel for these, say African forces,
                        you know, peacekeeping forces because one gets various reports, you know,
                        sometimes they come in and they are more of a problem, more looting by them
                        than by the enemy forces. What was your impression?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: My impression and that of others in my group was that this was an early
                    period, just the beginning for the African Union forces. Later, they would be
                    involved in many different operations and their actions and behavior would
                    change over time. Our concern at that moment was less centered on looting and
                    more on competence or the lack thereof. We were doing exactly what you referred
                    to in the context of Tajikistan — essentially looking for ways to get others to
                    do this work in our stead. However, African leaders in some instances were
                    simply grabbing guys off the street to send on these peacekeeping missions, and
                    many of the troops sent had no more idea which end of a gun was which. In other
                    words, most had extremely limited experience but the alternative was to send our
                    own troops, and that was definitely not popular.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were we looking at the time to develop competent
                        forces, including our own? I mean, for a long time the American military
                        resisted; they had a peacekeeping institute which they dissolved and all of
                        a sudden I think they reenergized but how did we- what were we doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: What we were doing at this juncture — again, our position shifted over
                    time — was primarily to focus on civ-pol activities, not only in Liberia or
                    Africa but also in the Balkans and elsewhere. We saw this as our value added or
                    particular positive contribution to train police, and we still do train local
                    forces to maintain law and order. Our goal was to gradually shift the balance of
                    responsibility so that local police and military forces would eventually be able
                    to take care of their own society. Similarly there was to be a broader component
                    which involved encouraging African state to have a greater vested interest in
                    the region and fostering the sense that this was not just another colonial
                    enterprise. In other words we wanted them to recognize that we were not just
                    seeking to take them over or even save them from themselves and that African
                    nations should play an active role in the peacekeeping/peacemaking process.
                    While it is all relative, these goals were reasonably well thought out and
                    well-intentioned.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, while you were doing this what was your impression?
                        I mean, were things kind of- were we a force, a positive force in this whole
                        effort?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: The United States? I think we were a positive but limited force in this
                    whole effort. In other words at that juncture, unlike let us say our later
                    “coalition of the willing” in Iraq there were quite a few countries providing at
                    least some troops operations such as UNMOT and UNOMIG, the UN peacekeeping
                    operations in Tajikistan and Georgia, and at any given time there might be
                    Dutch, French Italian or Brazilian troops on the ground. These were not strictly
                    U.S. operations and ours would be a relatively small presence on the ground,
                    even though we were a major contributor in terms of the overall financing of the
                    missions. So I think we were viewed generally in a positive light. The big issue
                    for us then was not our actions in the field but rather what we and others were
                    doing in New York. In other words, the central question for us was the extent to
                    which we want to back the UN approach or alternately to trim the UN sails, or
                    even the degree to which we wanted to be involved in selecting leaders of
                    peacekeeping operations and determining their overall activities. These were our
                    concerns. I'm sure there was some resentment over our making all sorts of rules
                    and regulations and telling the UN what to do without allocating too many troops
                    of our own for these missions. There is a certain irony in all this because
                    essentially some UN officials seemed to be saying the U.S. should be more
                    engaged on the ground and not be simply calling the shots from New York and
                    Washington. Other nations tended to resent our “American exceptionalism”, the
                    notion in this instance that while it was okay for Dutch, German or other troops
                    to be in danger zones in Georgia and elsewhere, the U.S. seemed unwilling to put
                    its own troops in harms way. We would see the other side of this coin later in
                    Iraq.</p>

                        come across your radar?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Not really then, but he was not a “player” during the Clinton era.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time obviously we were- Well, let us talk
                        about Haiti. Did you get involved in Haiti?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: Yes, to a minimal extent. There was a UN “police mission”, a program
                    specifically geared towards training Haiti's police force. Unfortunately, the
                    French expression “la plus ca change”.. holds true in this instance. One could
                    pick up a newspaper article almost at any time dealing with Haiti — five, ten
                    years, it doesn't matter — and think you are in the exact same timeframe. When I
                    was covering this portfolio, we had weekly or twice weekly working group
                    sessions that would meet to discuss what all the different agencies were doing
                    in the region, their various contributions and what was happening — whether
                    democracy was breaking out or poverty being alleviated. I am not being cynical .
                    It is just that this conversation was repeated so many times; it really was a
                    tragic situation. It seems the last few years have been calmer, and one does not
                    hear as much about developments in Haiti, which may actually be a positive
                    sign.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe it shows improvement if people basically are staying
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: That is right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Alright. Well, let us turn to the Balkans. Did you get
                        involved? Madeleine Albright was secretary of state and she took a pretty
                        strong stand on the Balkans. The Clinton Administration had initially, when
                        it came in, had been pretty dubious about the whole thing and wanted to stay
                        out and then she sort of got dragged in, kicking and screaming.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: And we were definitely involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But by the time you got there we had already gone through
                        the Bosnian exercise.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Yes, but we had Macedonia to deal with and later, at the very end of my
                    tour, the issue of Kosovo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was Macedonia that you had to deal with?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: The situation on the ground was that the UN had on the order of 1,000
                    troops there. The Pentagon and others, if I recall correctly, wanted to ensure
                    that our numbers were limited. As it turned out, about one-third of the troops
                    in the Macedonia mission were Americans, and that represented a significant
                    force for us. Again, our office was involved in only a small part of this
                    equations. We had to work with DOD and other agencies and tried to convince them
                    that this was (a) a worthwhile utilization of our resources and that (b) it was
                    important for us to be involved and play an active role. Many of our
                    counterparts were dubious about this in the beginning and were not thrilled with
                    the prospect of our engagement. So, in a sense, the Department was the more
                    proactive player at this point. .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was the situation in Macedonia that required
                        peacekeepers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: A mess. I'm sorry to say but Balkan history has been such a tangle for
                    hundreds of years. I guess for the record one would have to say that after the
                    demise of Tito and subsequently the break up of Yugoslavia and the formation of
                    small states in the region, everyone claimed a piece of Macedonia, located
                    basically in the center. That was certainly a key element. Geography was one
                    factor but ethnicity was just as salient. Every group seemed to be represented
                    in some corner or other of Macedonia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Bulgarians-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: The Bulgarians, the Serbs and the Greeks. The Greeks themselves have a
                    section of their country which they call Macedonia and which they certainly do
                    not wish to see independent or allied with a former region of Serbia. The
                    latter's move towards independence was very disconcerting to the Greeks. The
                    Serbs also did not want to lose Macedonia. You have the problem of the
                    disintegration of the former Yugoslavia coupled with the concerns of neighboring
                    countries and with ethnic element in Macedonia seeing themselves as distinct
                    from all the rest (wishing but not necessarily fully able to make it on its own)
                    and probably wishing for a pox on all of their houses. And on top of all that
                    and in quick succession was the emergence of the Kosovo crisis, which was tricky
                    because in this instance the USG was in favor of Kosovar independence. Yet,
                    historically, the Serbs had, at least from their perspective, a valid position
                    as well, since the most significant battlefield and region in all of Serbian
                    history is situation in the territory of Kosovo. Ironically, this is viewed as
                    the place where Serbs effectively fell on their swords, in effect making Serbia
                    one of the few countries in the world to celebrate its greatest defeat;
                    nevertheless, this was a critically important event in Serbian history. Thus,
                    for the Serbs to simply allow the land to be chopped off or included in an
                    independent Kosovo was deemed unacceptable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also it has some significant monasteries.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: That, too. And also, the problem throughout this region is that these
                    lands have been fought over with considerable bloodshed for centuries, and each
                    region has its ethnic pockets who fear abuse at the hands of the more dominant
                    group in the aftermath of independence. Thus, Serbs have their reason to fear
                    abuse for ethnic Serbs residing in Kosovo at the hands of the more dominant
                    Albanian group. So they are trying to protect their own as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well okay, let us take both Macedonia and Kosovo. What
                        were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Actually, these areas were a very small part of my portfolio. I should
                    step back and say that I had some prior academic background and interest in the
                    region and taught Balkan history prior to entering the Foreign Service. However,
                    what I learned from the perspective of our work in the Department was to play a
                    “finger in the dyke role”. One typical aspect of our profession is that someone
                    is always leaving an assignment early and thereby causing a staffing gap;
                    someone else has to pick up the slack, attend meetings and do whatever is
                    necessary to persuade colleagues and other bureaus or agencies that our position
                    (notably that of whatever office we inhabit or portfolio we inherit) — in this
                    instance the need to station USG troops on the ground — is the right one. It was
                    a struggle. Eventually, we did, get engaged but there was a lot of “kicking and
                    screaming” along the way. My own role: I wrote a lot of memos, organized
                    meetings, met with colleagues in hopes of persuading them that this was a worthy
                    endeavor; perhaps it helped.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find in IO, this goes across the board in your
                        experience, did it work with the desk because I mean, okay, you are talking
                        about international organizations but the feet on the ground are in
                        Tajikistan or in the former Yugoslavia. I mean, did you have any particular
                        problems with particular desks or bureaus or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I was very fortunate in that regard. I guess one of my strengths in that
                    period was that I had some credibility with the desk officers working on the
                    former Soviet republics because I had considerable experience in the area from
                    my prior assignments working on Soviet issues. I could always use the old
                    Clinton line “I feel your pain” with my former desk colleagues. I understood
                    where they were coming from so I often found myself in the position of
                    translating between my IO bureaucracy and the EUR contingent. I certainly
                    understood the desk officers' positions, at least those working on issues
                    related to the former Soviet Union and the Balkans. With regard to Africa, I did
                    my best but I could not claim any particular insights regarding what the Africa
                    bureau was promoting or any real expertise on the issues.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you sense, while you were dealing with this, any
                        unease at the top of the State Department or something in dealing with these
                        political issues, you know, like still we are not happy with or did not want
                        to get overly entangled in foreign affairs or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Yes. On the political front, the situation was often muddy for reasons
                    that had little to do with our own policies or preferences, and our leadership
                    might well ask why were getting involved or pushing a particular approach. One
                    case in point, for example, involved Macedonia. One of the newly independent
                    Macedonian government's first foreign policy moves was to recognize Taiwan,
                    which created some difficulties for us. On the one hand, we were trying to
                    convince our Pentagon colleagues to put troops on the ground and help struggling
                    Macedonia, while on the other hand, we faced a real possibility of a strong
                    pushback from the PRC. Indeed, we feared that the Peoples Republic of China
                    might veto the entire peacekeeping operation on account of Macedonian actions
                    vis-a-vis Taiwan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did they do this? It sounds like money.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: With Taiwan and China it often is. For instance, when we were talking
                    about the Caribbean, that is where you really see dollar diplomacy in action and
                    where Taiwan actively competes with the PRC for recognition. There are a number
                    of micro states that recognized Taiwan and in return received substantial
                    financial assistance or remuneration. So yes, money was a factor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: How did it end?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Well, the mission was delayed for starters. The Chinese, that is the
                    Peoples Republic, initially threatened quite loudly to veto the entire
                    operation, and we took the threat seriously. We in turn “played nice” with
                    considerable proliferation of paper, press guidances, and behind the scenes
                    efforts to persuade the PRC that the Macedonians were neophytes who did not
                    quite understand what they were doing. We urged them not to overreact, which
                    indicating at the same time that we understood PRC concerns. We also encouraged
                    them to not to show up on the day of the next vote. Indeed, the PRC either
                    abstained or simply were not present on that day and the mission did go
                    forward.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any dealings or reflections of the
                        stewardship of Madeleine Albright?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: I met Madeleine Albright for the first time long before she became
                    Secretary of State, when she was still at Georgetown. I was working as the
                    Hungary desk officer at the time, and she had planned a trip to Hungary and
                    other countries in the region to research a book dealing with what was then
                    Czechoslovakia and Hungary. She came to the Department for a briefing from the
                    relevant desks. I was frankly a bit surprised because she was a professor and
                    this was broadly her field, but she gave the impression of not having done her
                    homework, at not with regard to Hungary. But then again, this was a very limited
                    and superficial observation; nevertheless, I somehow expected a bit more or a
                    better sense of what she intended to write about. bout things that they got
                    their material as they go along. I think she probably ranked somewhere in the
                    middle tier of Secretaries of State I have seen. She was not the best, but far
                    from the worst.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I mean, she came and went and one does not have- I
                        mean, I do not get any particularly negative or particularly positive. I
                        mean, what she did was workmanlike.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: That is right. To give her her due, she was reasonable to work for in
                    terms of work or paper requirements and relatively accessible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I would also think from your particular perspective
                        working on international organizations her coming out of the UN would have
                        meant she was more sympathetic to the issues, I mean, for the overall bureau
                        she understood the problems.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Yes. Unlike certain situations within the Department where paper would
                    move forward only to be blocked within one's own hierarchy or where conflicts
                    with out bureaus were rampant, this was not the case in the IO Bureau on her
                    watch. We did not experience a great deal of internal deadlock. Whatever
                    problems we confronted tended to be with our sister agencies. .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find, speaking of sister agencies, how did you
                        find working with the Department of Defense?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: On the working level our relations were quite collegial. We did not
                    always agree but we were friendly. A contributing factor may have been that
                    during this period, our Peacekeeping Office always had two or three military
                    officers detailed to us and they came from various branches or offices at DOD.
                    As a result, we came to understand each others positions quite well, but the
                    fact remained that our hierarchies did not always agree, and therefore, we were
                    not always on the same page. That did not change.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: No, not really. I mean, we had intelligence briefings on certain aspects
                    of the missions and sometimes they would attend a group session.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: No, not really. The truth is that in a broader sense this was a
                    transitional period. After all George W. Bush was not the first president that
                    began his tenure intending to focus on domestic issues and instead wound up
                    doing more on the international front. As you mentioned the Clinton
                    Administration never intended to be engaged in these types of policy issues. In
                    a sense, what we do today without batting an eye was in that period the source
                    of a real tug of war among various USG agencies — State, the NSC, DOD and others
                    — with each intervention marked by significant interagency tension. Now, while
                    there are clearly other types of disputes among them, these groups, these types
                    of UN missions are not key issues.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q:: Well then, when and what did you do afterwards?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: I had one other Washington assignment that was somewhat of a return to
                    my old stomping ground. The office I moved to has changed names and no longer
                    exists in the same configuration but it was then known as S/NIS/C which meant
                    the Office of the Special Coordinator for assistance programs to the former
                    Soviet Union. It was then headed by Bill Taylor, who more recently served as our
                    Ambassador to Ukraine. He had been in this sort of assistance business for a
                    long time, initially working for Richard Armitage, who later became Deputy
                    Secretary of State and who, like Taylor, had originally come from a military
                    background but one very oriented toward such assistance programs. The S/NIS/C
                    operation had a humongous budget. Essentially, we oversaw all the so-called
                    “Freedom Support Act Funds” that were allocated to the former Soviet Union. A
                    separate office dealt with similar funding for Eastern Europe; eventually these
                    two offices merged. For me this was a completely different type of work from any
                    I had ever done before inasmuch as I had always been a political officer doing
                    work traditionally associated with political cone officers in the Foreign
                    Service. This office was really much more oriented toward economics and as an
                    economic unit, we were divided both geographically and functionally. So I worked
                    on the western region. Specifically, I covered Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus
                    geographically. I also had some functional responsibilities which were
                    interesting. They dealt with nuclear energy; the closing of the Chernobyl power
                    plant; some commercial cases, including cases of businessmen who had had bad
                    experiences in that part of the world; and environmental protection. Another of
                    my primary responsibilities had to do with a project Vice President Gore had
                    sponsored, namely a bilateral review commission, known by the name of the
                    U.S.-Ukraine Committee on Sustainable Economic Cooperation — a real mouthful —
                    whose major component involved improving economic ties between Ukraine and the
                    U.S. In this context, my boss would go once a year to Ukraine for commission
                    sessions, and the Ukrainians would in turn come to Washington. The result would
                    be the signing of numerous agreements technically under the auspices of the
                    Vice-President. This was a quite a big deal and made the Ukrainians feel very
                    good since this was a project the Vice President cared about from the outset.

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let us talk about the Ukraine first. This all struck
                        me that with the Ukraine sort of out of the orbit of Moscow, I mean, at
                        least, well, pretty much out of the orbit of Moscow, you never can really
                        talk about a revival of the old Soviet empire or the Russian empire. I mean,
                        this is a major thing and I would think from our perspective this would have
                        had extreme priority, I mean, just keep Russia from getting too big for its
                        britches as far as we are concerned. Was that the feeling then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: Russia did not take on Ukraine head-on at that time. Russia had so many
                    other problem areas to deal with after the breakup of the Soviet Union that it
                    focused principally on developments in Georgia, Tajikistan, Moldova, etc.
                    Ukraine was an obvious elephant in the room but it was not the focal point
                    because Russian leaders basically regarded Ukraine as a legitimate entity even
                    though it the historic heart of the Russian nation also happened to be in Kiev.
                    Still, they recognized that Ukraine could legitimately stand on its own. One big
                    issue among many was the issue of oil and the pipeline through the region;
                    another was the military equipment from Soviet days still in Ukraine; and there
                    were concerns related to geography, notably the status of the Crimean Peninsula
                    and the Odessa region. Thus, the question of how to square the fact that a
                    predominantly Russian-speaking region and a very Russian-oriented city (Odessa)
                    were now part of Ukraine — this was very much on Russian minds. Even in these
                    commission meetings we had with the Ukrainians, 75 percent of those involved
                    spoke in Ukrainian but a few cabinet ministers still preferred to speak
                    officially in Russian. And then one confronted a problem that was of genuine
                    concern to us, and remains an issue even to this day, namely Russia's role in
                    Ukrainian elections in support of traditional, Soviet-style, eastward-looking ,
                    Russian-speaking candidates as opposed to individuals who might be more
                    democratic in orientation. . Certain old habits die hard, and there continues to
                    be a great deal of corruption. And just because someone claims to espouse
                    democracy does not automatically make him a saint. Ukraine has had several Prime
                    Ministers or Presidents who were known to be quite corrupt, one of whom was
                    literally indicted by U.S. Justice authorities for a laundry list of offices.
                    I'm sure the Justice Department would have happily deported him if we could have
                    found a country willing to accept him — thereby sparing us the whole rigmarole
                    of trying a former Ukrainian top official in a U.S. court. For a time, some
                    smaller Caribbean countries were under consideration for such a “non-vacation”
                    destination, but I don't know what happened in the end.</p>
                <p>Back to your previous question regarding our concerns about the Russians. Sure,
                    we were concerned on many, many levels, but we were not worried that the
                    Russians were going to send in troops to Ukraine as happened in Transnistria.
                    .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you, in this job we are now talking about, in
                        the Ukraine what were you mainly doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: Well, several different things. One primary responsibility was to
                    monitor what AID was doing with U.S. Government funds in assistance programs in
                    Ukraine as well as the activities of other agencies. A key objective of our
                    office was to oversee and coordinate all assistance efforts so as to avoid
                    duplication. What you did not want was for ten different offices or agencies to
                    be implementing identical or even similar types of democracy programs in a given
                    country. So coordination was truly the name of the game — our main function.
                    Another was to work with Ukrainian officials and with our own energy-related
                    agencies here to help in the process of dismantling and ultimately closing
                    Chernobyl, as well as addressing the issues associated with what might replace
                    it, and of course, how to move forward. For example certain deals were struck.
                    The Ukrainians indicated that they would move forward with the decommissioning
                    of Chernobyl if we would support the development of an alternative type of heat
                    pump system. However, they were supposed to contribute as well to this project
                    and seemed to be reneging on their promised payments; consequently, we had to
                    negotiate to ensure they would fulfill their obligations.</p>
                <p>We were also working on a number of crosscutting regional themes or issues such
                    as trying to secure positions for scientists who had worked on sensitive types
                    of technology in the former Soviet Union's nuclear or biological weaponry field,
                    in other words to make sure that there were places these people could go. Health
                    was another regionally crosscutting theme; specifically we focused on how to
                    deal with the spread of tuberculosis which was becoming a pandemic in the former
                    Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>Speaking of disease, one of the things that gave me personal satisfaction was to
                    help the area, but initially Moldova, which experienced a series of droughts and
                    famines, by coming up with some sort of systematic humanitarian assistance and
                    food relief to keep them from going off the edge, and we did a lot. In fact, one
                    of the more unusual projects to come across my desk involved a very strange and
                    severe disease that broke out in several rural villages in Ukraine that
                    resembled a skin poison , which particularly affected children. The Ukrainian
                    government was afraid that if this leaked out that 50-100 children were showing
                    burn-like symptoms on their skin, mass hysteria might become a real problem. So
                    they asked for our help. It fell to me to try to assemble “lickety-split” a team
                    of people from CDC (Centers for Disease Control) in Atlanta and a few other
                    agencies that had medical diagnostic skills and send them to Ukraine to work
                    with Ukrainian medical authorities to see if they could come up with something.
                    Eventually, they did come up with something — namely they discovered that there
                    had previously been some sort of weapons depot in the area and that there had
                    undoubtedly been some leakages of chemical connected with this. Moreover, the
                    kids had played in the area where the seepage had occurred. This finding did not
                    totally solve the problem of causation but came fairly close or at least close
                    enough to address the burns. The situation was kept relatively quiet . While
                    this was not a national secret or anything of the sort, the goal was to avoid
                    creating widespread fear.</p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>So these were the types of projects I worked on. I was also what was called the
                    Executive Secretary” for the US-Ukraine bilateral commission, which meant that I
                    would be the one responsible for coordinating the paperwork — whether drafting
                    it myself or getting papers from others — and the overall organization for the
                    meetings we held twice a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, around '94 or so I was in Kyrgyzstan and the place
                        was awash with these non-governmental organizations and missionaries and
                        everybody else going out to do good, you know, often at cross purposes or
                        quite ineffective and some were very effective. Did you get involved in
                        trying to get these things- was this part of the effort?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: We could not really control the NGOs but what we could control to a
                    certain extent were other USG entities. In other words the EPA was working on an
                    environmental project...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let us stop.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>This is tape six, side one with Nadia Tongour. Yes.</p>
                <p>TONGOUR: While we certainly met with different groups that work in our part of
                    the world, our actual oversight responsibilities strictly involved those who
                    received U.S. o We met with them and that was another thing; we would meet with
                    lots of different groups that were going to our part of the world but
                    essentially we were- our oversight responsibilities had to do strictly with
                    those who received USG funds. Also we were responsible for keeping Congress
                    informed. Since the money ultimately came from Congress, we were constantly
                    sending up “15-day notifications” for all the various programs we oversaw. In
                    other words, we did not actually veto EPA or any other government department
                    from carrying out its projects but rather they would basically funnel their
                    requests through us. We in turn would approve the requests, notify Congress and
                    then if there were no congressional “holds”, distribute the funds. We are
                    talking now strictly about the three countries that I oversaw and specifically
                    the Freedom Support Act funds, which were on the order $250 million at that
                    time. The overall budget for S/NIS?C was approximately $875 for assistance
                    funds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A big hunk.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: That is right. And this was strictly USG support funds and didn't
                    include money from NGOs or other groups.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for dealing with the Ukrainian
                        embassy and all and how they operated? Did they have much connection with
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: They had substantial contacts, not only with me and our office but with
                    many USG agencies. You mentioned earlier a group that had strong local
                    community-based involvement. Ukrainian-Americans were extremely active in this
                    regard, but they were also very divided amongst themselves; it often seemed as
                    though there were hundreds of Ukrainian-American organizations. This was a
                    problem because they split along religious, geographical, and political lines.
                    As you know, a considerable portion of the region is already divided between the
                    Orthodox and Catholic faiths, but in addition, Ukraine had the Uniate Sect, a
                    third branch essentially between Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy, not to
                    mention other smaller sects that have flourished. But, Ukraine was further rent
                    by an East-West split, with the Western part more Catholic and linguistically
                    Ukrainian versus the more Eastern, more Russian-speaking steel mill and mining
                    towns which were more conservative and more oriented toward Russia and Eastern
                    Orthodoxy. Then too, there was the issue of Crimea and its long Russian
                    connection. Finally, there was the gamut of political views associated with
                    different waves of �migr�s, with some having been more pro-German during World
                    War II and others who were more pro-Soviet, and so on. Each of these myriad
                    groups would weigh in with the State Department and advocate for their
                    respective positions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am trying to think, is there any other sort of issues
                        that you were dealing with and did these �migr� groups have any particular
                        clout?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: They certainly had a measure of clout first of all because
                    Ukrainian-Americans were well represented in various USG agency. For example, in
                    the Department of Commerce two of my closest colleagues dealing with Ukraine
                    were themselves Ukrainian-Americans. Now, they actually were quite balanced in
                    their views and were simply doing their jobs; nevertheless, they were always on
                    the receiving end of petitions. Moreover, we were all constantly being invited
                    to attend this or that speaking event to here a notable from Ukraine or from the
                    Ukrainian-American community on a particular set of issues. In all fairness,
                    this was a time of great enthusiasm for Ukraine. At the same time, we were
                    fairly aware of the fact that there was some foot dragging on various Ukrainian
                    government commitments to us. with regard to projects they claimed they wanted
                    in order to become more democratic or to get beyond Chernobyl and become a
                    really viable independent country. There was still an awful lot of the “old
                    think” prevalent. Various officials would insist they really wanted to move
                    forward with bilateral democracy building programs, welcoming our aid for
                    educational projects, etc., but, in fact, traditional attitudes and behaviors
                    were quite pronounced. .</p>

                        am thinking of various programs, our visitors programs, students, Soros and

                <p>TONGOUR: Very much so. What we found was that among the younger generation, many
                    ha already learned English, which had not been the case with the parents'
                    generation. Older diplomats did not all have English, whereas the younger ones
                    definitely did. Soros eventually established programs in Ukraine but he was also
                    very active in Moldova as well as Hungary, Romania and elsewhere in the region.
                    However, at the time, I would not say that he was especially focused on Ukraine,
                    but other donors certainly were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a phenomenon that one notices, you know, you
                        could go to the beach resorts or anything else that today most of the
                        waiters or waitresses, mostly women, waitresses are from Eastern Europe and
                        from the Ukraine and all coming over for their earning but going back out
                        obviously, becoming quite, well I would say almost Americanized or at least
                        understanding our culture.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Yes, yes. And it is not just in the waitressing field. I noticed this at
                    a camp my son attends. It seems that any number of the counselors are from
                    Ukraine and other parts of Eastern Europe. I mention this only in passing but it
                    definitely appears that many of their young people were and continue to make
                    their way here and do quite well</p>
                <p>It's probably worth mentioning that the office I was in (S/NIS/C) later fused
                    with a similar office that dealt exclusively with Eastern Europe and is now
                    known as ACE — covering the entire region of the former Soviet Union and Eastern
                    Europe. Obviously in the following years, the Eastern European countries have
                    come a long way, with many having joined the European Union and some having
                    sought admission to NATO. Not surprisingly, in the course of less than a decade
                    Freedom Support Funds were reduced substantially and are considerably less than
                    what they were then.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at this exchange, people coming to the West to the
                        darker side of trafficking, particularly of women into prostitution and all
                        that because I understand the Ukraine was a major supplier.</hi>

                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: It still is. And I can share with you an amusing experience that
                    demonstrates this, which occurred in Kiev during one of those Bilateral
                    Commissions I mentioned. A colleague and I were the designated note takers for
                    the session. We had planned to work on our report at the hotel but there really
                    was no office space available to do so. Therefore, that evening we sat in the
                    lobby of our hotel, drinking cups of coffee and drafting our report. The hotel
                    was quite westernized and it was teeming with young “working women” who,
                    whenever I stepped away for a moment would approach my male colleague and
                    essentially proposition him — saying things like “why are you sitting here
                    writing a report when you could come have fun with us. Subsequently, I have seen
                    Ukrainian and other East European women in scattered countries obviously working
                    as prostitutes. e, coming over to my male colleague and sort of saying, why are
                    you sitting here writing your report with this woman. Why do you not come and
                    have fun with us? The economic situation has improved but the old dichotomy of
                    people from small towns and rural areas, who are still hurting, often come to
                    the big city and often find themselves in these situations — either becoming
                    prostitutes in the city or meeting someone that ships them abroad for similar
                    purposes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved at all in the problem of the ones who
                        ended up sort of in the hands of Western European managers? That is a fancy
                        term for pimps.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: No, we did not. In a later assignment, working on human rights issues,
                    my office highlighted this in our annual human rights report. At this particular
                    juncture, we were still dealing with more basic issues, related to the country's
                    recent independence, specifically economic and governance concerns, but not this
                    particular problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Russian-Ukrainian split? I mean, was there
                        the feeling that this is going to work itself out or is this going to be a
                        long term problem between the two ethnic- I am not sure they are even ethnic
                        groups but whatever you want to call them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Well, they certainly see themselves as distinct. Yet, they are all
                    Slavs. However, historically, there has been so much intermarriage especially
                    from Kiev to the East regardless of whether they choose to speak Ukrainian or
                    Russian. There is invariably the situation where someone has a Russian mother or
                    a Ukrainian father or Polish uncle who married a Russian or Ukrainian. In other
                    words, there has been an awful lot of interbreeding, which in some ways helps
                    keep the frictions in check. Still, underlying frictions remain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what about the Black Sea Fleet? I mean, when one
                        looks at this, I mean, there was a tremendous endeavor on the part of the
                        Soviet Union to build up a magnificent fleet. I mean, I am sort of a navy
                        buff and I look at some of the beautiful ships and they are all rusty. And
                        the Russians really have, I mean, there is nothing you can do with them,
                        particularly.</hi>

                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: That is a very good question.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that come across your desk at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Not really. It was one of those background topics that comes to the fore
                    during military discussions. Our group was more focused on economic issues.
                    Arguably, the status of the Black Sea Fleet was both an economic and a military
                    issue, but I am not sure where it stands right now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Chernobyl during the time you were there what
                        were you doing Chernobyl-wise?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Chernobyl-wise, there were extensive negotiations but internally (within
                    the USG) and with Ukrainian officials regarding alternative sources of
                    energy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A quick question: was Chernobyl producing power at the
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: It was still producing some power. As a result, there were serious
                    discussions on technical, scientific questions related the decommissioning or
                    completely sealing off of the reactor. And there was a considerable amount of
                    work that needed to be done to seal off and close Chernobyl forever. Plus, there
                    was the associated technology of the heat pump I referred to earlier that was
                    essentially supposed to replace the reactor. The problem was the heat pump was
                    quite expensive and Ukraine was supposed to cover some of the costs,
                    specifically an amount on the order of seven and a half million dollars, whereas
                    we were to contribute the balance of roughly $30 million. However, the
                    Ukrainians tended to back pedal on paying and as a result, we had to press them
                    repeatedly for their share of the payment. In the end, it all turned out fine,
                    and there was a major ceremony held to mark the official closing of Chernobyl,
                    and our Ambassador traveled to the site to participate. Of course, we spent a
                    great deal of money trying to (a) help them with alternate fuel sources and (b)
                    assist them with the social aspects associated with the closure. One of the side
                    issues connected to the closure was the fact that locals in the area generally
                    wanted to keep the reactor functioning because of the jobs involved. Power
                    plants provided relatively well-paying employment, after all, for substantial
                    numbers of people. Consequently in addition to funding for the heat pump, the
                    Ukrainian government sought our financial contribution to deal with the “social
                    costs”. In fact, we do some things — instituted various programs aimed at job
                    retraining and relocation, and so forth. It was a tricky situation to get people
                    who had spent their entire lives working in or around Chernobyl and working on
                    these reactors, simply to move. Where do they go? What sorts of transferable
                    skills do they have? Those were the kinds of issues we had to address.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you are an old Moldovan hand; did Moldova, was that
                        part of your portfolio?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: It was. But in the case of Moldova, we focused on more traditional aid
                    programs, including democracy promotion and educational projects. The key
                    question for us was how best to build civil society. AID had a number of
                    educationally oriented programs which unfortunately really didn't address the
                    problem of how to build a democracy in a divided war-torn country. In truth,
                    theirs were the more traditional assistance programs. We did visit Moldova and
                    tried to carve out new niches for our assistance. But the country in the region
                    that we attended to least, at least in a positive sense was Belarus, which was
                    still too much of an old line state.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were we sort of writing off Belarus because of its
                        leadership and all at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Yes and no. To the extent that we could, we tried to help those
                    individuals who represented voices of reason but without placing them in
                    jeopardy. Sometimes we had to be very careful so as not to “help them” wind up
                    in jail. We had to walk a tightrope, both seeking to assist dissidents while not
                    creating problems for them. Essentially though, we recognized that until the
                    leadership changed, there was only a limited amount we could really do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about other countries, Germany, France, Britain,
                        Scandinavia; were they playing much of a role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I think it probably varied from country to country and in terms of those
                    with a particular interest. Some helped particular favorites, such as the Baltic
                    Republics. Likewise, there was considerable support for the traditional
                    East/Central European countries such as Hungary and Poland. I suspect, but don't
                    know for a fact, that the French might have helped the Moldovans via Romania
                    since there were some ties to the latter. Nevertheless, we were clearly the “big
                    kid on the block” with our Freedom Support Act funds dwarfing anything others
                    could provide. At the same time, I must admit that other countries were often
                    more effective in their allocation of resources than we were and often got a
                    bigger bang for their bucks, in the process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well I think probably in size and oversight, which often
                        means too much effort is put into oversight, you might say, accounting and
                        all this.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: One aspect of our assistance programs that has often saddened me is the
                    fact that so much of AID's huge budgets (as well as that of other agencies) is
                    spent on supporting itself or supporting contracts. Consequently, when you get
                    right down to it, recipients don't always fully appreciate the amounts
                    officially spent on their behalf because in many respects the results aren't
                    always tangible. For our part, we often think that the recipients should be more
                    grateful but what they actually receive or see is sometimes not nearly as great
                    as it might seem, given the substantial amounts spent in the process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, is there anything we should cover that we have
                        not covered in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Regarding your question of whether other countries were involved, I should
                    probably mention an organization known by the acronym PAUCI, which stood for
                    Polish-American-Ukrainian Initiative. The idea behind it, which we initiated,
                    was — was, to encourage involvement from Ukraine's neighbors in the area of
                    development. As was the case in African peacekeeping operations that we spoke of
                    earlier, we believed we should not be the ones telling Ukraine how to develop
                    economically or move forward. Rather, we thought that a country with more
                    relevant and recent experience, such as Poland, could play a constructive role
                    in the process. So, we held semi-annual meetings between representatives of our
                    S/NIS/C office and Polish and Ukrainian government officials to address themes
                    related to growth and economic development. Poland by this point had made a
                    great leap forward on this score, and the idea was to help Ukraine move along a
                    similar path. It was a worthwhile venture. Still, there were frictions among the
                    parties, particularly related to funding levels and leadership roles in the
                    process, but it wa a good idea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, what is it, about 2000 when you left this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I stayed until the summer of 2001. After that I had an assignment that I
                    jokingly described as one that provided me with more titles than staff, which
                    was to be the DCM/Principal Officer/ Charg� in Grenada, where I arrived in
                    August of 2001, just three weeks before 9/11. But to sum up the two Washington
                    assignments we were discussing, they were both very interesting and informative,
                    but I found that I really preferred working in what we term a regional bureau.
                    These had been “functional” assignments in which I had many responsibilities,
                    but no single country that you could call “yours” as was the case when I worked
                    as a desk officer for Hungary or Georgia.</p>
                <p>

                <p>TONGOUR: Yes, which is a tiny country in the Eastern Caribbean.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Working in Grenada was a totally different situation, where we have had
                    a mission ever since U.S. intervention there in 1983. Nineteen American soldiers
                    died during our intervention there. As for Grenadians, even to this day, they
                    refer to our military operation on the island as an invasion or a rescue
                    mission, depending on their political persuasion. The term intervention is the
                    most “neutral”. In any case, in the immediate aftermath of the intervention —
                    this was the Reagan era after all — there was a great deal of sentiment in favor
                    of keeping an American presence in Grenada; in fact, initially, in the 1984-85
                    timeframe, we had quite a large Embassy there. Its worth pointing out that in
                    recent years, throughout the Caribbean, we have cut back on the number of posts
                    we have in the region. Right now most of the islands are covered out of
                    Barbados, or with a few handled out of Trinidad to the south or Jamaica further
                    north. In years gone by, we had posts in Martinique and Antigua as well as
                    Grenada. Grenada is the only one of the smaller posts remaining. Yet, after the
                    intervention, there was a large AID presence as well as military personnel on
                    island. Over the years, the staff was steadily reduced. Today it is a miniscule
                    post; nevertheless, it is called an embassy, which makes for an interesting
                    situation. Technically, the post is an embassy because Grenada is an independent
                    country; therefore, the mission can't be a consulate. However — and this is why
                    I had so many titles — the Ambassador resided in Barbados, and served as
                    Ambassador not only for Barbados and the countries directly covered by Embassy
                    Bridgetown but also for Grenada. As long as she wasn't on island in Grenada, I
                    served as Charg�, but when the Ambassador came to Grenada, I served as DCM. It
                    tended to be confusing, especially since when I bid on the position, it was
                    listed as a Principal Officer slot. In any case, I had a small staff and I had
                    to deal with a number of “residuals” from the intervention period.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We have got time; why do we not talk about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: We can certainly talk about the history, which was quite fascinating.
                    Many countries in the Caribbean obtained their independence from Britain in the
                    late 1960s or 1970s. Countries differed in terms of the specific year. Barbados
                    was one of the early ones, becoming independent in 1966, I think; elsewhere,
                    most of the smaller island nations gained their , independence a bit later, in
                    the '70s. Unfortunately, most were totally ill prepared for independence at the
                    outset. Very shortly afterward, in Grenada, as was the case in several other
                    countries, a highly charismatic figure came to the fore and garnered a
                    considerable amount of power. Initially, the first crop of independence leaders
                    tended to come from the ranks of those who had either “fought” for independence
                    early on or had been active in local labor movements. They were genuinely quite
                    popular and at first truly focused on local needs; however, over time, some
                    wound up becoming despotic or corrupt. In the case of Grenada, this pattern was
                    complicated by the prevalent or growing Cuban influence in the region. Plus, you
                    have to recall that there was a whole generation of so-called “children of the
                    60s” who now in the 70s had gone on to study law or be in some ways influenced
                    by leftist philosophers or leaders such as Castro and Che Guevara and wanted to
                    change the power-mongering and corrupt systems they saw in their own country. As
                    for Grenada, the early hero of the independence years, Sir Eric Gairy, over time
                    increasingly began to fit this model. Then, too, he started acting a bit crazy
                    and openly spoke of his belief in extraterrestrials.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was Bishop?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: No, not Bishop. This was Eric Gairy (who subsequently obtained the title
                    “sir”), who preceded Maurice Bishop. He wound up becoming rather arbitrary and
                    corrupt, as well as deemed crazy by some, which prompted a group of young,
                    bright-eyed idealistic leftists to carry out a coup against him. The group that
                    seized power consisted of a number of persons who became known as the “New Jewel
                    Movement”. The individual who was most widely regarded as the head of the
                    movement was Maurice Bishop, himself a very colorful character, with substantial
                    appeal to many Grenadians and a bit of a Che Guevara “look-alike”. His main side
                    kick was named Bernard Coard, who will play a key role in the events that
                    triggered the U.S. intervention. Coard was not as charismatic as Bishop, and by
                    all accounts a more traditional, hard-liner — less flamboyant, less outwardly
                    sympathetic, but possibly more intellectual, or at least more of an ideologue.
                    Essentially from late 1978 or early 1979 until 1982-83, these two and their
                    leftist/socialist cohorts were in charge. They did not call themselves
                    communists at that point but they were definitely influenced by Cuba. It appears
                    that many of them would have happily accepted assistance from the United States;
                    some might even have welcomed being “adopted” by us — or so they later said. But
                    the USG implemented the same types of polices that have been, as we all know,
                    ever so “successful” in Cuba, and completely turned its back on them, denounced
                    the leaderships and made it clear we wanted nothing to do with this leftist
                    regime. For its part, it was indeed moving further to the left and began to look
                    more and more toward Cuba for assistance. The Cubans were more than willing to
                    help out, especially with the building of a big, international airport, which
                    was not something the USG viewed with equanimity. So to summarize, in the midst
                    of increasingly economic problems and political isolation, the Grenada regime
                    looked increasingly to Cuba for support and in the process grew increasingly
                    radicalized. Over time internal conflicts arose, as well, between a faction led
                    by Bernard Coard, and individuals still loyal to Maurice Bishop. Eventually, the
                    situation basically came to a head or boiled over, with Bernard Coard and his
                    confederates carrying out a second coup. Not only did they overthrow Maurice
                    Bishop, but they killed him and a number of his supporters, resulting in
                    fighting in the streets and considerable concern abroad, particularly in the
                    U.S. regarding civil unrest and its potential impact on American citizens,
                    particularly medical students at St. George's University. The conflict was not
                    quite a civil war, but the threat of it — coupled with the perceived danger to
                    our citizens and the fear of Cuban/Soviet involvement — triggered our
                    intervention on October 19, 1983, which lasted roughly a week. Not this is just
                    a summary version of events. There were many keystone cops aspects to the
                    intervention, which occurred without a great deal of information regarding the
                    actual lay of the land on the island, a shortage of useful maps and disastrous
                    communications systems. Moreover, as I previously mentioned, 19 American troops
                    died in the process. However, by October 25, Bernard Coard and his cohorts were
                    rounded up, and calm was gradually restored. Thereafter, the United States was
                    in charge for the next six months to a year, and tried to restore order to the
                    country. AID came onto the scene with sizeable staffs from Barbados to provide
                    assistance; plus we had a fairly large mission on the ground. Coard and company
                    were tried and imprisoned — many for life — and most are still incarcerated. But
                    there was a considerable division in Grenadian society between those who viewed
                    the American involvement as a rescue mission and those who described it as an
                    invasion. The more balanced or middle of the road types used the term that we
                    ourselves use, namely intervention. As I previously mentioned, Maurice Bishop
                    and his associates were initially quite popular and remained so for a number of
                    years, but as they grew more radical in their positions, they themselves became
                    increasingly arbitrary, even “despotic”, imprisoning all sorts of enemies, real
                    and perceived. I know a gentleman who has a successful tour business today who
                    spent three years in jail for no particular reason apart from the fact that he
                    was deemed a supporter of Sir Eric Gairy, whom the New Jewel Movement had
                    overthrown. The problem for a small island like this one is that everyone not
                    only knows everyone else but knows who did what to whom. People who pulled
                    triggers and killed others, and many families were split. Much later, a truth
                    and reconciliation commission was established, which we might talk about later,
                    but the fact remains that in a small society with scarcely more than 100,000
                    people, everyone is either related or aware of one another, and a great deal of
                    residual resentment from that period remains. Every year Grenadians celebrate
                    October 25 as a national holiday of Thanksgiving, but it's a very specific sort
                    of Thanksgiving, name for the American intervention. While I was there, we had a
                    presidential delegation (not the President but his representatives, including a
                    key military leader of the intervention) to commemorate the 20th anniversary of
                    the event.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I arrived in August of 2001, three weeks before 9/11, and left in the
                    summer of 2004.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By this time had Grenada pretty well disappeared off our
                        list of interests in the Caribbean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Well, it seemed that each year, at least while I was in Grenada, there
                    was a serious discussion in Washington about whether or not to close the post.
                    And every year those wishing to keep it open were able to beat back elements
                    advocating closure. There were several valid arguments on both sides but the
                    prevailing view centered on paying homage to President Reagan and the nineteen
                    Americans who died during the intervention. A second factor was the large expat
                    contingent on island, as well as the students and staff of St George's
                    University, which certainly deserve to be mentioned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The medical school.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: It was an offshore American medical school, which at that time had no
                    more than at most a couple hundred students. However, when the conflict among
                    the various factions escalated and when it was clear that there were Cubans on
                    the ground, there was great concern about the safety of the American students.
                    Today St. George's is not simply a medical school, but an actual university with
                    5-6,000 students in a variety of disciplines, including a major veterinary
                    program and various other divisions in addition to the large medical school.
                    Obviously, there is now a substantial community of American faculty and students
                    who are voters — or in the latter case, their parents are — and they are very
                    interested in what's happening on the island, as well as in retaining some
                    official American presence there. There is also a large expat, mainly retirees
                    who have been known to contact their congressmen to ensure that the island keeps
                    its embassy. Given the fact that the post was technically an Embassy, I tried
                    something innovative in terms of the resumption of visa services. Until then,
                    and subsequently, residents of the Eastern Caribbean had to travel to Barbados
                    or Trinidad to apply for a visa to the U.S., which could be quite costly for the
                    locals. So we came up with a way to try to do visas in Grenada, using roving
                    consular officers from Barbados, which was very popular while it lasted.</p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>Another noteworthy factor in our dealings with Grenada was that the Grenadian
                    government was comprised of many individuals who had spent a substantial portion
                    of their lives in the United States. The Prime Minister himself had been an
                    American citizen. According to Grenadian law, a government official cannot have
                    dual citizenship. As a result, he (as well as several others) had to renounce
                    his American citizenship. Similarly, the Foreign Minister had attended college
                    and law school in New York; had married a South Carolinian who still works in
                    their law practice in New York. Those are just two examples, but as I said,
                    there were others. So, there were definitely many links. Also, and it's probably
                    worth noting, that at the UN General Assembly, Grenada's one vote has the same
                    weight as that of China, and every once in a while we do recall that our Embassy
                    in Barbados covers seven island nations, which together with other states in the
                    region can constitute a considerable voting bloc in international
                    organizations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find, did you have one or more than one
                        ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I had two ambassadors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Barbados always had political appointees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would assume so.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: And some are better than others. The second ambassador , a woman from
                    Iowa, who had been a key figure in that state's Republican Party, was actually
                    quite good. I think she may have been the Party Chair for her state and had been
                    an active supporter and fund raiser for George W. Bush, playing a significant
                    role in winning Iowa for him in 2000. She was a no-nonsense person who really
                    understood local politics. By her own admission, he originally knew next to
                    nothing about international relations or the Caribbean region to which she was
                    assigned. In fact, when she was informed that she would be ambassador to
                    Barbados, she told me she bought a book to figure out exactly where she would be
                    going. But, as I said, she did know how local politics worked; therefore, she
                    was very good at grasping what politicians in various islands she covered were
                    concerned about. In short, she was effect. She was honest and did not pretend to
                    know more than she did; local leaders responded well to her.</p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>The first one was a more complicated case. He was a successful businessman from
                    North Carolina. He also had had no international experience, but in his case he,
                    outwardly at least, looked the part of an ambassador. However, he got into some
                    trouble socially while in Barbados, and let us say seemed to have a penchant for
                    seamier sides of life on the island. Apparently, he was discovered in some less
                    than appropriate situations for an ambassador and was asked to return home. I
                    don't really know the details, but I think I've said enough.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You put it very diplomatically.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Cuba at all an influence while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Absolutely but not in the way we tend to think. The Cubans, like many
                    others were very savvy about stretching limited resources so as to maximize
                    their impact. And what is it that Cubans do well? As a generalization, they do
                    medicine. They have ample doctors and education programs for doctors. Their
                    programs may not be top of the line, not comparable to the Mayo Clinic, for
                    example. Yet they do have medical schools which welcome Caribbean students, as
                    well as a number of other academic programs for students who might not be able
                    to afford studying in the U.S. or elsewhere. Apart from training, Cuba also
                    provided medical “resources”. When Grenada desperately needed a new hospital and
                    we could provide next to nothing, they turned to the Cubans. And what did the
                    Cubans do? The Cubans did not have money to offer but could provide labor. While
                    I was there, large numbers of Cuban laborers came to the island to help
                    construct a new hospital, and arguably winning a few “hearts and minds” in the
                    process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How come we have got a big medical school there and no
                        hospital?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: No connection. That's not completely accurate because there are
                    connections between the medical school and the government, but the medical
                    school itself is an interesting phenomenon — in that it does not train students
                    in a hospital setting on the island. The program at St. George's is technically
                    a five-year medical program with the first two years spent on island and the
                    remainder spent elsewhere generally back in the U.S. or England, or possibly
                    some other country in a training hospital. They follow this up with their
                    residencies wherever, just like any other medical school program. However, they
                    pay St. George's for the full program even though in a sense they get farmed out
                    to hospital schools in Boston or wherever. While in Grenada, the students take
                    their basic anatomy, biology and other classroom courses. For whatever the
                    reason, they never worked it out with the government to establish a separate
                    hospital for the university — perhaps cost was a factor but I'm not sure.
                    Nevertheless, some of those who do the training, the professors, are themselves
                    doctors, and they sometimes provide medical assistance to residents of the
                    island. . The island itself has some decent doctors; it's just that the
                    facilities were long lacking. When I first arrived, the general hospital was
                    horrific. I remember thinking when I first saw it, please don't let anything
                    happen to me or my son while I'm here. By the time I left, thanks largely to the
                    Cuban contribution, Grenada had a brand new, quite beautiful hospital. It might
                    not have had the latest, state-of-the-art equipment, but as a facility it was
                    complete.</p>
                <p>Today is the 24th of March, 2008. Nadia, alright, you are just back from a trip
                    to Grenada so the island is fresh in your mind.</p>
                <p>TONGOUR: ...Looking back on my early days on island, many Grenadians seemed
                    somewhat wary of us or retained negative, albeit mutedly so, attitudes towards
                    the U.S. even 20 years after the intervention. Those who had been very pro-U.S.
                    tended to be rather less enthusiastic than before because they felt the U.S. had
                    not done as much as it might have or what they hoped for. To put it differently,
                    one could almost imagine them making a plaintive cry to the effect of “Daddy,
                    why have you left us”. After all, given the large contingent (by local
                    standards) of U.S. troops, Embassy personnel and AID staff, there was clearly an
                    expectation that the U.S. would provide substantial economic assistance — a bit
                    of manna from heaven. Unfortunately, as we all know, there were competing
                    demands. It was the bad luck of the Grenadians that the fighting in Lebanon
                    broke out at the same time, and the focus of attention quickly shifted. That has
                    happened repeatedly over time and seemed normal from our perspective. However,
                    from a more insular viewpoint — and islanders could be considered somewhat
                    parochial in their orientation — the world stopped there, so why did the aid
                    “dry up”? Not surprisingly, many felt let down by the dwindling support over
                    time. In fact, while in the ensuing period, Washington grappled with whether
                    even to keep this small post open, Grenadians were baffled by the continual
                    drawdown in the size and functions of the embassy until what was left was a tiny
                    post with very little by way of assistance. So, there was some disillusionment,
                    a sense of somehow being let down.</p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>In any event, when I arrived in Grenada in 2001, people were certainly polite
                    enough, but there was not initially any particular warmth or even contact from
                    government officials. In contrast, the expat community was very welcoming; yet
                    weeks went by before anyone in the government deigned to meet me. In part, this
                    was undoubtedly due to my August arrival, when many officials were on vacation.
                    After 9/11, there seemed to be a complete reversal in attitudes. Obviously this
                    occurred throughout the world, but in a small society such as Grenada the
                    outpouring of sympathy was quite visible. People actually put flowers in the
                    openings of the chain link fence that surrounded the Embassy building. There
                    were spontaneous church services, including one in the local cathedral to honor
                    the dead and show respect for the United States — overall, an incredible show of
                    support on the part of Grenadian and expat society. For a brief honeymoon period
                    Grenadians seemed to forget whatever negative feelings they had had from the
                    intervention era. Gradually, the overwhelmingly positive feelings subsided, but
                    that, too, was common throughout the world; we seem to have squandered
                    considerable goodwill in the years that followed. By the way, there were also
                    two Grenadians who died in the World Trade Center bombing. They may have also
                    been U.S. citizens, but Grenadians regarded them as their own.</p>

                <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: They felt it. And I guess another factor worth emphasizing is that while
                    arguably on a small island such as this an embassy makes little sense, there is
                    another side to this story, namely the existence of so many islanders — often
                    newly minted American citizens — residing in our own country. It so happens that
                    there are more Grenadian expats living in Brooklyn or London or Toronto than
                    there are in Grenada itself. Everyone has a cousin, brother, parents, whatever
                    living in New York, and most are dual nationals. Others are constantly in and
                    out of the country, and it is sometimes a tricky issue if you think of it in
                    terms of immigration or visas. Many people reside in the States as part-time
                    residents, much as many Americans spend their winters in Florida and return to
                    New York or wherever for the remainder of the year. On the islands, there are
                    the “now birds”, who generally build themselves a home on the islands for the
                    winter or retirement and spend the warmer months “back home”. In the West
                    Indies, there is a broader phenomenon — not limited to Grenada — wherein earlier
                    immigrants to England often return to their island of origin as they reach
                    retirement age and build themselves grand houses, much larger than anything they
                    could have afforded had they stayed home in the first place. They often return
                    with “foreign” accents, sounding more British than West Indian. And the locals
                    have a term for them: JCBs, which means “just come back”. Unfortunately, some of
                    these JCBs also return with a certain “attitude” about the proper way things
                    should be done and tend to offer all sorts of helpful advice to those who stayed
                    behind. This does not always go down well with the locals. This pattern is less
                    true for those who went to the U.S. Although some do return, or at least buy
                    property with that intention, a larger proportion simply come back to visit.
                    Where this all leads in that out of any government cabinet of say 12 to 15
                    people, more than half at some point have had dual nationality. However,
                    according to Grenadian law, Grenadian officials could not retain their “other”
                    nationality and serve as a high level elected offical. By law, they were
                    expected to renounce their former citizenship but sometimes they neglected to do
                    so.</p>

                    Minister still retained his American citizenship. The issue had, in fact, been
                    festering for some time and he had actually submitted his paperwork for
                    renunciation some time earlier but it fell to me to accept formally this
                    renunciation. Interestingly, inasmuch as he was the PM, he wanted me to call on
                    his office to take care of the paperwork. I explained that while I would always
                    be happy to call on him, and, I implied, be appropriately deferential, when it
                    came to submitting a renunciation, it would be more appropriately handled at the
                    Embassy. He agreed.</p>

                    agreed upon documents. .</p>

                <p>TONGOUR: Yes, and I actually had three titles. Technically I was Charg�, DCM, and
                    Principal Officer. In addition, I signed all the adoption forms, Consular
                    Reports of Birth, etc. So yes, I legitimately functioned as a consular
                    officer.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because you know, there is this divide, somebody who is an

                </p>
                <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: True, but I was not technically an ambassador. However, the logic of
                    that rule escapes me. You can be a DCM in a proper Embassy as well as a Charg�,
                    but how can one be a Principal Officer in a separate country at a post
                    designated an Embassy. Usually Principal Officers are at Consulates. And again,
                    why is that an Ambassador cannot do consular work. I'm sure there are specific
                    rules but it remains a bit esoteric to me. On a practical level, what made the
                    situation a bit complicated for all involved was the fact that Grenadians most
                    of the time were either oblivious to the fact — or didn't really care — that an
                    ambassador residing in Barbados was really “their” ambassador. They basically
                    regarded the person in charge of the post in Grenada as the ambassador;, and
                    even though I never pretended to have that position, many people insisted on
                    calling me “Madam Ambassador” or referring to me as “our ambassador”. Clearly,
                    our Embassy in Bridgetown was well aware of this attitude and did not care for
                    it. In fact, Embassy Bridgetown advocated closing the post in Grenada. So this
                    was a point of friction between the two posts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I cannot remember exactly what we have talked about

                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: No, not during my time there. However, military attach�s or staff
                    assigned to Bridgetown or even Caracas would occasionally come through. But we
                    did have a wonderful, temporary military presence in the form of so-called New
                    Horizons projects, which were very popular on the island. Have you heard about
                    New Horizons? or perhaps Trade Winds, another military exercise in the
                    region?</p>

                <pb facs="0156" n="Page0156"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: The Southern Military Command (SOUTHCOM) based in Miami would
                    periodically stage training exercises throughout the region. I imagine other
                    regional commands likewise had such programs, but I can only speak for the
                    exercises carried out in Latin America and the Caribbean. In any given year,
                    SOUTHCOM would schedule a certain number of such projects in the region, and
                    these projects or training exercises would include an engineering and medical
                    training component. So, after considerable planning and preparation in
                    conjunction with the host government, our troops would come to a particular
                    country and build a school or an old age home or whatever structure might be
                    needed. Essentially, a government could request a specific construction project
                    but it had to meet certain criteria, notably that the structure could be
                    completed within a fixed and relatively short period of time. The construction
                    project would last for approximately five or six weeks. In addition to the
                    engineers, medical teams would go out into the countryside to work in rural
                    clinics, examining patients or providing services that were often not available
                    or scarce locally. You could not win more hearts and minds — these exercises
                    were truly popular. While I was in Grenada, a New Horizons team built two
                    schools and an old age home. One of these schools they built from scratch; the
                    second involved adding to an existing structure. Plus they built a 20-person
                    facility for the elderly. And, of course, they had teams of doctors going out to
                    rural parishes to treat residents who did not see doctors on a regular basis. So
                    it was wonderful.</p>

                <p>TONGOUR: The timing of my departure may have been fortunate for me but difficult
                    for my successor. By the time I left, I had been there three years and basically
                    knew a lot of people on the island, whereas my successor had only been at post
                    for a few weeks went Ivan struck. It was undoubtedly a nightmare for her, both
                    personally and professionally inasmuch as she had an elderly mother living with
                    her, whom she did not want to leave in the immediate aftermath of the hurricane.
                    Apparently, she stayed cooped up in the residence for a few days rather than
                    venturing out, which resulted in some negative reactions regarding her handling
                    of the situation. As it was, she had a number of distraught American citizens
                    and countless Embassy issues to deal with, and it was all too much. She did not
                    stay more than a few months.</p>
                <pb facs="0157" n="Page0157"/>
                <p>In the aftermath of Ivan, USAID provided substantial assistance, I think, on the
                    order of $30 million. How much of that translated into visible results was
                    unclear, which is often the case with AID projects because much of the funds go
                    to contractors or to programs that are not readily visible to the public. By
                    contrast, the Venezuelans or the Cubans or even the Chinese come in and engage
                    in highly concrete and visible projects. The PRC, for example, ascertained that
                    the most important project from the standpoint of the Grenadian Prime Minister
                    was to rebuild the sports stadium, so that Grenada could take part in the
                    international cricket competition. To clarify this point, the cricket work cup
                    was scheduled for 2006 and was to be held in various venues throughout the
                    Caribbean. Grenada had been expected to host a few of the matches; however,
                    hurricane Ivan had completely demolished the stadium. In fact, the original
                    stadium would have had to be upgraded in any case even without the onslaught of
                    Ivan. Just prior to Ivan, the Prime Minister had been weighing his options
                    regarding continued recognition of Taiwan or the possibility of switching
                    Grenada's allegiance tot eh PRC. Heretofore, Grenada had been one of the 16 or
                    so countries that still recognized Taiwan, and the government of Taiwan had
                    always been quite generous in its support. However, the “other” China eventually
                    made some very appealing overtures to the Grenada government. I don't wish to
                    sound cynical but dollar diplomacy was very much at work here, and the PRC's
                    terms were more lucrative. Indeed, shortly after Ivan, the Chinese sent scores
                    of workers and materiel to Grenada and in short order built a brand new stadium.
                    Moreover, a sizeable labor force was left behind which now does contracts for
                    all sorts of labor intensive projects, and to some extent competes with other
                    local construction firms.Likewise, several other countries also provided
                    tangible assistance. The Venezuelans, in particular, built a large number of
                    low-cost housing units. That was one of their contributions. But we did
                    considerable good as well. .</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am not sure of my timing but was any sort of Venezuelan
                        Chavez phenomenon going on when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Absolutely.</p>
                <p>Q; How did this translate to where you were?</p>
                <pb facs="0158" n="Page0158"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: The Venezuelan presence took two main forms. First of all, and this is a
                    regional phenomenon, the Venezuelans have traditionally operated very successful
                    cultural and language institutes that offer free classes in Spanish to local
                    participants. I have seen such Venezuelan Cultural Institutes on a number of
                    different islands in the Caribbean, and they are all very popular. I myself
                    brushed up on my Spanish there, as did many people I knew. This was not
                    officially part of the Venezuelan Embassy and functioned largely as an
                    independent entity. What was fascinating to me about both the Institute and the
                    Embassy was the anti-Chavez attitudes several individuals more or less openly
                    displayed. Their Embassy was quite small, consisting of only a handful of
                    people, two of whom were openly disdainful of Chavez and one never lost an
                    opportunity to criticize him as a leader. How she managed to do her job for as
                    long as she did was rather remarkable. Still, she did come from an upper class
                    family and was quite well connected. Nevertheless, it was unusual to hear a
                    diplomat describe the head of her government as a monster or a nincompoop.
                    Another officer, albeit more discreet, was also quite negative. Likewise, the
                    Ambassador, another woman, was careful in terms of what she said, but did not
                    seem to be a big fan of Mr. Chavez. However, what you are really asking concerns
                    the economic or political impact of Venezuela on the region. And this manifested
                    itself in cheap oil. Chavez instituted a program called PetroCaribe, which aimed
                    at creating an oil monopoly in the region. He did not succeed as evidenced by
                    the continuing existence of Texaco and other oil companies still active in the
                    area. Still, the idea was to provide relatively inexpensive gas to the island
                    nations — obviously in return for their support and allegiance. To a certain
                    extent, the approach worked. Compared to other countries, gas prices in this
                    region were not astronomical; while gas was not cheap, it was manageable, which
                    was definitely a Venezuelan “contribution”.</p>
                <p>Other forms of Venezuelan support were mainly symbolic. For example, Grenada's
                    National Day is February 7, and every year the Venezuelans would send in a big a
                    ship loaded with marching bands and acrobats, including people who jumped out of
                    helicopters, which created quite an impression. We, on the other hand, did very
                    little to commemorate their holiday. Frankly, it would have been much
                    appreciated had we routed some vessel sailing around in the Caribbean to Grenada
                    basically to “show the flag”. It had been known to happen in years past, but
                    while I was there the most we did was to have our Ambassador or Defense Attach�
                    come over from Barbados to attend the National Day parade. I say this only to
                    make the point that on a small island with only half a dozen embassies, whatever
                    one does in such instances is always noted and known to all.</p>

                <pb facs="0159" n="Page0159"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: Better than some, but in most cases Caribbean states would vote as a
                    block. In many instances, particularly on matters that were of importance to us,
                    they would insist on CARICOM (Caribbean Community) unity and vote more or less
                    as one; thus, we would not be in a position to divide them. Periodically, there
                    would be some major event or crucial issue that would prompt lead to the
                    representatives of the various island nations getting together in Bridgetown to
                    meet with some visiting Washington dignitary or other. Overall these states
                    tended to be fairly pro-American in terms of the way they voted. In other words,
                    for the most part, they voted in ways that were favorable to our views or
                    positions, but when they did not, they would oppose us as part of the CARICOM
                    block.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Iraq war play there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Badly. But they were very shrewd in that regard. Deafening silence is
                    one way to put it. They were studiously polite in many instances; when they did
                    not want to deal with an issue and simply chose not to discuss it. And Iraq was
                    a case in point. However, I'm not exactly sure where things stand now in the
                    islands on the question of the Iraq war. While I was there both the government
                    and the opposition in a somewhat odd way “used” the Iraq war to score political
                    points at home. As it turns out, there were a few Iraqi families that had
                    somehow managed to come to Grenada. As was the case in many countries of the
                    region, Grenada had an economic citizenship program. Are you familiar with that
                    term?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Essentially you buy your citizenship. But the term is a bit more
                    gentile. One makes a commitment to invest a certain amount in the country and
                    acquires status as an investor. By providing a substantial contribution, one in
                    turn receives a passport.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even if you were not really a resident?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0160" n="Page0160"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: For the most part these economic citizens were rich enough to have
                    various residences, and some of them were not very savory characters. A few also
                    bought diplomatic titles as well. At that time, there were a number of offshore
                    banks, and again, not all were of the highest caliber. The situation improved —
                    cleaned up — considerably while I was in Grenada. Meanwhile, the Iraqis I
                    referred to had managed to get economic citizenship in Grenada sometime before,
                    which provided the opposition politicians with a useful weapon to use against
                    the government. Specifically, the opposition publicized the fact that these
                    Iraqis had traveled to Barbados in hopes of obtaining U.S. visas and apparently
                    had not succeeded in their quest. The opposition in turn blasted the government
                    for having allowed “terrorists” into the country and providing them with refuge.
                    The problem with this scenarios was that this particular group of Iraqis
                    happened to be Christians and extremely pro-American, at least initially. We
                    discovered this because shortly after the onset of our engagement in Iraq, an
                    Embassy guard informed me that there were some Iraqis outside who wished to see
                    the American Charg�. While I was not really thinking about terrorism, I did
                    wonder if they were asylum seekers. I recall thinking that if I let them into
                    the building I might be faced with a problem if they did not want to leave.
                    After all the embassy was technically American territory. To play it safe, I
                    went outside to talk with them. On meeting, they simply said they wanted to
                    thank us, specifically mentioning President Bush, and were effusive in their
                    praise — certainly more so than anything I had heard in a long time vis-a-vis
                    our actions. They also asked me for an American flag. I replied that I would try
                    to obtain one for them. I checked with Bridgetown, and everyone was so excited
                    that these Iraqis had asked for an American flag that I was authorized to give
                    them one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I was wondering, did the issue of Puerto Rican
                        independence; was that something that came up at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: No. As far as the Eastern Caribbean islanders were concerned, Puerto
                    Rico was basically a transit point, an airport, which they wished they could
                    avoid transiting. There really was an extremely limited interest in issues
                    affecting more distant areas — not counting the U.S. or the United Kingdom.</p>
                <p>If you look at a map, Puerto Rico is a very long way away and the biggest concern
                    was how many hours one would have to spend in the San Juan airport in order to
                    get to the U.S. However, your mentioning independence reminds me that this very
                    concept which we value so highly was not initially something many islanders were
                    terribly keen on. Of course, the sentiments varied from place to place, but for
                    many, it seemed as though the Brits just kicked them out of the nest, and it
                    came as quite a shock. Many West Indians were well aware that they were really
                    not prepared for independence when they obtained it. Even later, many would joke
                    that it would be nice if we or some other nation could adopt them — make Grenada
                    or some other island a 51st state. That was a not uncommon theme.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this is, of course, true of some of the Stans, you
                        know, part of the Soviet Union. I know Kyrgyzstan really had profited by
                        being in the Soviet Empire.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: That is right. One of the more interesting or complicating aspects of my
                    assignment had to do with the Cuban mission on the island. As I mentioned, we
                    had a very small diplomatic community, and the Cuban Ambassador and I were
                    always invited to the same events. Moreover, the Cuban residence was just down
                    the street from my own residence — less than a quarter of a mile. So it was
                    difficult to avoid him and his wife. Moreover, they had spent a number of years
                    in New York at the UN and enjoyed talking to anyone about his experiences there.
                    Had he not been the Cuban Ambassador, I'm sure I would have enjoyed getting to
                    know him and his wife. But that was not to be the case, although it's virtually
                    impossible to sit in stony silence at a dinner table when you are all thrown
                    together. In any event, he enjoyed talking about going to the New York Yankees
                    baseball games and things of that sort — a genial type, much liked by the
                    Grenadian authorities. Once again, those Grenadians that had been pro-Cuban
                    earlier continued to remain sympathetic and the government as a whole managed to
                    essentially, I would not use the word milk, that is too strong, but derived
                    whatever benefit they could from whatever source they could. So, as I told you
                    last time, the hospital, building construction project and so on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Jamaica, it is sort of the big boy on the block and
                        did it have a certain amount of resentment or did it have any influence
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Yes and no. To understand the region, one needs to think of a triangle
                    in which Trinidad, Barbados and Jamaica make up the points — albeit an oddly
                    shaped triangle — with a number of other island nations wedged in between.
                    Jamaica was just far enough away as to have a positive influence, and many
                    Grenadians did go to the university there, if they didn't wind up studying in
                    England or the U.S. Since it was fairly distant, Jamaica did not have the
                    negative connotations that were associated with Barbados or to a lesser degree
                    Trinidad. In truth, it is hard to dislike the “Trinis”, as they are generally
                    perceived as pleasant and fun loving. Barbados is somewhat of a different story.
                    People here always assume that other countries in the region would like to
                    emulate or draw closer to Barbados, but for many Barbados represented the big
                    kid on the block for whom they had a certain distaste or resentment, which might
                    have benefited Jamaica and Trinidad in terms of regional ties. Some believed the
                    “Bajans” (local term for Barbadians) were convinced of their own superiority or
                    had their noses in the air. I remember hearing them described as the Swiss of
                    the Caribbean, not a concept exactly synonymous with fun.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the ex pat community, did it have much, was there
                        much work for you or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0162" n="Page0162"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: It is a large community for the size of the island largely because of
                    the medical school and university, which has now grown to several thousand
                    students — from the roughly 100 or less at the time of the intervention. It's a
                    beautiful campus, absolutely gorgeous — in fact one of the loveliest I've seen.
                    How many college campuses are perched over the Caribbean, and filled with pastel
                    colored stucco buildings. As I already mentioned, the university had virtually
                    exploded in size, with programs in many fields, including the liberal arts. As a
                    result, there was a doubling or even tripling in the size of the expat
                    population. In addition to the students, there were administrators and faculty
                    who receive substantial salaries, who like to purchase imported items.
                    Food-wise, you can buy practically anything in Grenada, including items not to
                    be found in Barbados or other larger islands. If you wanted smoked salmon or
                    exotic cheese or interesting wines, they were all there, giving the island a
                    certain touch of sophistication not found among some of its neighbors. Then too,
                    the largely American student body wanted pizza and other goodies, which were
                    available as well. On top of the university crowd, there was yet another expat
                    contingent comprised overwhelmingly of retirees. They had certain needs, such as
                    social security checks which were sent to the Post. There were also deaths,
                    births and other welfare and whereabouts issues, usually involving tourists who
                    would occasionally get robbed or have some other problem, and all of these cases
                    took a fair amount of time. That said, the expat community was a congenial group
                    that contributed substantially to my pleasant life in Grenada. .</p>

                <p>TONGOUR: Absolutely. First of all, the Embassy itself had what was known as a

                    American community, and the wardens would meet with me periodically. In previous
                    years, when the embassy had been larger, there had actually been an American
                    school — technically an international school — which eventually folded. This was
                    unfortunate for me since my son attended school in Grenada.</p>

                    that made for an interesting situation. Although he went to a private school

                    other things, courses in West Indian agriculture, cricket (for p.e.) and so on.
                    Moreover, inasmuch as he was there in the sixth grade, he also wound up taking
                    something known as the “eleven plus” exam — otherwise known as the common
                    entrance ex. It was an interesting process, in that while literacy rates were
                    quite high throughout the English-speaking Caribbean, the number of high school
                    slots were somewhat limited and at a premium. For example, the island might have
                    4,000 students in the sixth grade taking an exam for admission to approximately
                    1,000 high school spots in the country. What that meant, of course, was that the
                    remaining 3,000 or so would not be going on to secondary school, at least not at
                    that time. There were, in fact, provisions to re-take the text and some other
                    options, but in general the system was rather restrictive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were these British run exams?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: They were similar to the British system of exams but were more Caribbean
                    in content and approach.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is not a Grenadian?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0164" n="Page0164"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: No, these are regional exams, offered throughout the Caribbean
                    “Commonwealth” at the same time each year. The reason I stress this distinction
                    is that the exam included questions that probably would not be on the British
                    version, questions having to do with agriculture or West Indian cricket stars,
                    etc. I should mention that it was considered prestigious to place within the top
                    100 candidates; as it turns out my son placed 64th in the island. To elaborate,
                    making it into the top 100 wins you considerable praise, making it into the top
                    1,000 earns you a mention in the local newspapers where the top 1,000
                    individuals are listed in rank order, with the name of the high school they plan
                    to attend. There was a lot of hoopla associated with the publication of the
                    list. Much to my surprise, my son was ranked “the top boy” in his school based
                    on his exam score. I mention my surprise because his grades were normally not
                    that high and there were a number of girls ahead of him in the pack. One of his
                    girl classmates was 8th in the island and , of course, “top girl” in his school.
                    It so happens that her parents were friends of mine, and the father called to
                    congratulate me on my son's performance. I remember saying I should have been
                    the one calling them, to which he replied “Oh, but you are not West Indian”. In
                    other words, the locals were surprised that a foreigner had done as well as he
                    had. I, in turn, commented that I was unaware mathematics was geographically
                    linked. “Yes,” he said, “but not every American knows the local cricket
                    players”. In sum, the vast majority of students did not go on to secondary
                    school but attended what was called a school-leaving program up to the age of
                    14. And of course, they could take the common entrance exam a second time, and
                    many did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was there any push to get more into the upper ranks
                        or was this-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: To create a larger more American style school system? Certainly but
                    money was a major problem. And one other sad aspect of schooling throughout
                    these islands was the fact that while the public schools, especially on the
                    lower levels were for the most part adequate, the students or their families had
                    to pay for their uniforms and books, which often were quite expensive.
                    Invariably, you would run across situations where a woman would work as a
                    domestic for the express purpose of earning money to pay the school fees and
                    books for nieces, nephews or cousins. Families would pull together to obtain the
                    wherewithal for their kids to go to school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you notice, was there a color system?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0165" n="Page0165"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: Certainly there was an informal one. In one of the neighboring
                    countries, there was a joke to the effect that there were at least 20 different
                    names for color shades among the populace of the islands. By comparison, Grenada
                    was a fairly “dark” island, with an old whitish upper crust. I visited the home
                    of a couple who were descended from the local aristocracy, if you will, who were
                    basically a shade of tan year round. They lived in a mansion that resembled a
                    19th century castle . According to local lore, at the turn of the 19th to the
                    20th century a West Indian ha gone to England and brought home a bride. He had
                    considerable money and built her what he thought she was used to, namely a type
                    of gothic castle. Well, whether it was the man or the castle, we don't know, but
                    what was certain was that she ran off after only a year. The castle remained but
                    changed hands a number of times over the years. The current occupants have a
                    whole wall of photos of various ancestors. It resembles a model UN, with every
                    imaginable shade. Interestingly enough, , while the owner did not mind the fact
                    that he had all sorts of black ancestors, he did not want to be mistaken for an
                    East Indian (from India). Yet, clearly some of his ancestors also came from that
                    part of the world, based on facial characteristics. Yet, he somehow saw that as
                    a stigma.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One always thinks of, often or not-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Of race? It's in the background.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the whole Indian community, was there much of an

                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Some but not especially and for the most part its members had become
                    quite successful. Many of the East Indians in Grenada had more recently migrated
                    from Trinidad, where their ancestors had come as poor indentured servants. Over
                    time, they or at least their children prospered, notwithstanding their humble
                    roots.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, you were talking about- well, before we get to other
                        aspects, I was wondering, we were talking about sort of social life. In some
                        islands, I think maybe Jamaica, members of the ruling classes would actually
                        bring their second or third wife to social functions. Did you find this to
                        be true in Grenada?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0166" n="Page0166"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: Not really. This type of behavior may have been more prevalent in larger
                    islands. Even in Barbados, there was a culture of the so-called “outside woman”
                    in contrast to the “inside woman” (the legal wife) and the Bajans were more
                    daring in bringing outside women to certain events. But in a small society like
                    Grenada people would always know who the “other woman” might be. The good or the
                    bad aspect of being in so small an island was definitely the gold fish bowl
                    quality, or the lack of a real private life. One more or less had to behave or
                    else not care what others thought because most dalliances were quickly
                    discovered. Arguably, this may have served as an enforcer of good behavior.
                    Still, like everywhere, there were “few saints” and a share of “sinners”, and it
                    was well known which government official or local leader was having an affair
                    and with whom. And so it goes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let us talk about some of the aspects of the
                        political life up there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: When I arrived the word on the street was election would occur shortly,
                    and they did occur about a year or so later; more recently, another round of
                    elections were held this year (2008), and the opposition party took over the
                    government. In terms of which parties were in existence then, it's probably
                    worth mentioning that the “oldest” party, or the one that had been ousted by the
                    New Jewel Movement and its more radical followers — whose activities eventually
                    triggered our intervention — was the party headed by the late Sir Eric Gairy. As
                    I mentioned earlier, he had initially been perceived as an early national leader
                    and a key figure in events leading to Grenadian independence. However, over the
                    years, he came to be regarded as somewhat eccentric, if not crazy, due to his
                    claims of seeing flying saucers and so on. He had formed a political party
                    called the Grenada United Labor Party , the GULP, which for many years had been
                    the leading vote-getter in the country. More recently, it had fallen on hard
                    times, and Prime Minister Keith Mitchell (in office until 2008) was one of the
                    early leaders of a breakaway group called the New National Party (NNP). He was
                    in power for three five-year terms, but the NNP lost out to a rival party in the
                    2008 election. Mitchell spent many of his earlier years in the United States,
                    attending Howard University and obtaining a PhD there. He owned property in
                    Maryland and prospered in the U.S. On his return to Grenada — after the
                    intervention — he was regarded as a national figure, not actively linked to the
                    preceding revolutionary movement. But after a number of years in power, certain
                    less savory aspects of his administration came to the fore, including his
                    support for offshore banking enterprises, some of whom were deemed less than
                    clean. Then, too, there was the economic citizenship program which our Treasury
                    Department officials deemed, if not corrupt, somewhat inappropriate. Plus sums
                    of money seemed to disappear or alternately “appear”, as in a much heralded case
                    wherein the Prime Minister was videotaped accepting a suitcase filled with cash
                    in a hotel room — an incident which has resulted in legal action. The case was
                    rather bizarre, though I'm not sure exactly how or whether it has as yet been
                    resolved. This type of incident over time leaves a bad taste in peoples' mouths
                    even though many businessmen and community leaders traditionally supported
                    Mitchell and his NNP in part because he was smart and capable and secondly was
                    not perceived to be a leftist.</p>
                <pb facs="0167" n="Page0167"/>
                <p>Now, you might wonder, why is this significant today? Because over the years, a
                    number of the more intellectual types, you might say the island's intelligentsia
                    (some of whom had earlier been associated with the New Jewel Movement)
                    gravitated to the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC). The names of
                    these two main parties , and to some extent their policies, might be seen as
                    interchangeable. However, during my tenure, Prime Minister Keith Mitchell and
                    his NNP was the government and the NDC represented the principal opposition
                    party. By 2003, there was a widespread sentiment that the government might
                    conceivably lose the upcoming election; if not, it might still lose the
                    overwhelming majority of seats it had held for many years. The main issue of the
                    day was corruption and the need for change. Whatever else the opposition was, it
                    was for the most part not judged to be corrupt. The key problem for the NDC was
                    the fact that some of its members were former “revolutionaries” who were still
                    regarded as leftists. So elections were held and the outcome resulted in an
                    eight-seven split, and frankly there was considerable controversy surrounding
                    one NNP seat. While the NNP retained the seat and won the election, the results
                    could easily have gone the other way. An Organization of American States (OAS)
                    mission monitored the elections which came down to the wire on the sister island
                    of Carriacou, where the recount went on for several days, but in the end Foreign
                    Minister Elvin Nimrod held on to his seat. And Mr. Nimrod himself is an
                    interesting man. Married to a South Carolinian who lives in New York, he went to
                    college and law school in New York and owns a law firm in Brooklyn that
                    continues to function and is now operated by his wife as a family business. When
                    he returned to Grenada and joined the government, he had to give up his American
                    citizenship.</p>
                <p>Now (2008), Grenada is facing another round of elections, and the opposition is
                    expected to win. Today, when you drive around the island, you can see a
                    veritable building boom, with gigantic houses popping up which neither you nor I
                    could ever afford. The roads have been repaired since hurricane Ivan and there
                    are directional road signs all over the island — something I promoted during my
                    tour. I remember pushing the idea that road signs would be very helpful if the
                    government wanted tourists to visit. In any case, most of the buildings in the
                    downtown area have been repaired or rebuilt, except, interestingly enough, for
                    the churches and the Parliament building. Were you to visit Grenada today, you
                    might well wonder why Parliament and two or three major churches don't have
                    roofs yet; otherwise, you would not know that there had been a devastating
                    hurricane a few years before. So, with a lot of help from their friends, the
                    Grenadians have done a good job.</p>
                <pb facs="0168" n="Page0168"/>
                <p>However, the government apparently has been selling off national assets such as
                    prime lands and national parks without exactly informing the public — basically
                    the national patrimony. The corruption level is high, and there are many who
                    claim the place is totally bankrupt. Individuals are certainly buying and
                    building homes, but the government is reputedly broke. Elections are due any
                    time now, and as I mentioned the opposition has a good shot at winning. What
                    makes the upcoming race especially interesting is the fact that the leader of
                    the opposition is considered by be a very decent, honorable man, who is not only
                    widely respected but is also known for having spent three years in jail during
                    the revolutionary period thanks to the very New Jewel Movement, many of whose
                    members are now in his party. In fact, his leading deputies, the so-called
                    second and third in command were both active members of the revolutionary regime
                    who are now both lawyers. They have modified their views of the world somewhat
                    since then. (Note: Since the aforementioned was recorded, the opposition NDC won
                    the 2008 election, with Tillman Thomas named the new Prime Minister; Keith
                    Mitchell, however, retained his parliamentary seat and is the new leader of the
                    opposition.).</p>

                <p>TONGOUR: Some, because there are many inlets and harbors. This is not necessarily

                    recent years, but it certainly serves as a transit point. If you consider drug
                    routes, you'll see that Grenada is not that far from the northern part of South
                    America, and with its extensive shore line, there are many places for drug
                    runners in so-called cigarette boats to pull in. .</p>

                    disaster, which included some training on how to handle a terrorist threat, but
                    it was not a major focal point. In order of priority while I was on island, the
                    biggest concern dealt with money matters. It seemed for a while that there was a
                    near permanent presence of bank investigators thanks to the agreement of the
                    Prime Minister to clean up the offshore banking sector, which had been hurting
                    his relations with the U.S. Treasury as well as the country's standing with
                    various financial institutions such as Standard and Poor's. So Price Waterhouse
                    teams were frequently on the island as was the Legal Attach� from Barbados.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Legal attach�.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Yes, legal attach�. Basically they were checking on the whole offshore
                    banking system in conjunction with an ongoing legal case in the U.S. which
                    involved a horrific pyramid scheme wherein lots of little old ladies had
                    invested their life savings into a bank, whose name now escapes, set up by a guy
                    from Oregon, who, in fact, possessed next to nothing aside from one large jewel
                    that he had somehow obtain in Uganda. It was to Uganda that he subsequently fled
                    with all these people's money, but his so-called bank had been a fixture on the
                    offshore banking circuit in Grenada for some time. The actual investigation of
                    this case had been going on for several years before I arrived, but I recall
                    receiving all sorts of letters sent to the Embassy from citizens in small towns
                    in eastern Oregon and Idaho bemoaning the fact that the senders had invested
                    their life savings in the bank, with nothing to show for it. The bank had gone
                    under and the banker had absconded with their money — so our officials were
                    investigating the case.</p>
                <p>To a certain degree there was close collaboration between the local government
                    and our Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Narcotic Assistance Unit
                    (NAS) based in Bridgetown. Our agents would come over and be very discreet in
                    their dealings with the local coast guard units, providing them with various
                    forms of assistance. This was one area where our assistance was very effectively
                    deployed, namely our aid to the local coast guard in upgrading their boats and
                    repairing them as well as training their officers in how to interdict the
                    cigarette boats and other vessels entering the harbors. And there were some
                    successes that came out of this.</p>
                <pb facs="0170" n="Page0170"/>
                <p>One of our priorities at that time were cases of American citizens who had been
                    defrauded by various scam artists operating in the region as well as money
                    laundering and the prevalence of offs-shore banking, which I had previously
                    mentioned. Drugs, of course, were always a concern. Terrorism, less so, except
                    in Trinidad where a few years earlier there had been a small radical movement
                    that had an Islamic orientation, and included among its membership Indians and
                    Pakistanis then living in Trinidad. Since they seemed to advocate violence and
                    other somewhat threatening objects, they had been a source of considerable
                    concern and obviously a focus of attention. But this was not really an issue in
                    Grenada.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what were you, sort of back to the relations
                        business, was there concern that Chavez was trying to do anything there
                        outside of sort of good works?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I think it's important not to underestimate the significance of good
                    works, especially given the limited amount we were doing in this region. One
                    point I should stress is that when I arrived there was no real assistance budget
                    for Grenada. AID had already cut back its operations in the entire region.
                    Officially, the Caribbean regional operation was by then based in Jamaica,
                    although a few AID officers remained in Bridgetown. To be sure, they would
                    occasionally visit or sponsor a project but usually this was a low-profile
                    endeavor. When I arrived I quickly discovered that everyone had their hand out
                    for assistance, and I had no funds to give them. The trouble wa that what locals
                    wanted or needed most did not fit into any of our aid categories. In other
                    words, USAID does not provide funds to host a dance aimed at raising money for a
                    new floor in a school. Or there was no money to buy a school on computer or a
                    community center one sewing machine. I used to think the Brits had a brilliant
                    system. They never had much money either but they did have a little “slush fund”
                    or $25,000 or $30,000 which could be used for such small scale projects. .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I thought ambassadors and- have this but-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: But the charg� did not. The ambassador could allocate small amounts of
                    money but usually these were spent on emergencies. In essence, I was constantly
                    being asked to donate for this, that or the other; since there were no funds
                    designated for such activities, more often than not I simply paid for the
                    tickets for the dance or whatever as a personal contribution. What I did manage
                    to accomplish in this area was a form of creative financing, which meant tagging
                    on to events that Bridgetown was having. For example, if a little theater group
                    was coming to Barbados to present an HIV/AIDS awareness program, we persuaded
                    the powers that be to allow them to come to Grenada as well. While we could not
                    technically charge money for the performance, we would suggest donations, and
                    any donations provided would then be donated to the local HIV AIDS program.
                    Similarly, if there was a speaker coming somewhere in the region, we would try
                    to get them to come to Grenada as well, to give a talk or put on a workshop —
                    and we received positive publicity for our efforts.</p>
                <pb facs="0171" n="Page0171"/>
                <p>But back to the subject of the ambassador's fund, because the ambassador did
                    indeed have a fund for small projects, including a program for heritage/tourism
                    development. Grenada happened to have some ancient petroglyphs from the time of
                    the original Arawak and Carib inhabitants, which were quite interesting stone
                    carvings. Moreover, the northwestern part of Grenada where the petroglyphs were
                    located had very little tourism even though it was very pretty. Yet there was a
                    beach and these stones that could be developed. Since I knew some people who
                    were involved in environmental cleanup and tourism projects, I spoke with them
                    about possible proposals they could submit. Specifically, we spoke of a plan to
                    clean up the local beach and the rocks so that the petroglyphs could more
                    readily be seen and also to set up a cafe and other amenities to make this
                    location more appealing and desirable as a tourism destination. Anyway, they did
                    submit a proposal, which I helped edit and amazingly enough the proposal was
                    selected. In other words, the Grenadian group won the prize. It was only
                    $10,000, but still $10,000.....,</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can go a long way in that part of the world.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: It did indeed. The local group cleaned up the beach and the rocks;
                    gradually people started selling artwork and souvenirs in the area. Whether they
                    are still doing do, I don't know. For a while, at least, there was visible
                    progress in the area. So, what does all this have to do with Chavez? Well, at
                    that point, Chavez had not yet come across quite as crazy as he later seemed,
                    even though he already had plenty of foes. Still, he was engaged in what you
                    called “good works projects”, as were others. And since we did not appear to be
                    doing very much, one really had to jump through hoops to be visible in the same
                    way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were your relations with the ambassador? Who was the
                        ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0172" n="Page0172"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: I think I mentioned that I served under two during my tenure. The first
                    one only came over to Grenada a couple of times, which may have been one reason
                    why the locals did not focus too much on Embassy Bridgetown. The first
                    ambassador was an old friend of the Bush family and had been a major fundraiser
                    as well as a successful businessman in North Carolina. I may have mentioned that
                    he did not last very long and was recalled for various reason. Leaving aside his
                    personal behavior, one difficulty his staff faced during his tenure was his
                    attitude towards Foreign Service officers. He made it clear that he did not have
                    a lot of use for us as a group, which created some difficulties for us,
                    especially when he openly questioned why we were not more motivated by profit or
                    when he pointedly asked why there were so many single mothers in the Foreign
                    Service. It so happened there were a number of women at post raising children on
                    their own, and such comments weren't appreciated. In terms of Embassy Grenada,
                    he seemed a bit perturbed by the fact that the house rented for the Charg� was
                    quite lovely, a new home that in some respects was nicer than the Ambassador's
                    residence in Barbados. I'm not imagining this because he mentioned it to me on
                    several occasions. He also made no secret of the fact that he wanted the place
                    closed. He also made it clear that it wasn't personal — he seemed to like me
                    well enough — but that he simply did not approve of the idea of having a mission
                    in Grenada. My saying that I did not set the rules regarding the existence of
                    the post and that it predated my tenure made no difference. In any event the
                    second ambassador was far more successful in her work in the region and in her
                    relations with the staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Ambassador Mary Kramer, from Iowa. She had been a prominent figure in
                    her state Republican Party hierarchy, playing a key role in securing a victory
                    for George Bush in Iowa in 2000. She had also been elected to the Iowa state
                    legislature, if I recall correctly. Initially, as I may have mentioned, she had
                    no idea where she was going when first offered the position of ambassador to
                    Barbados. She may not have know her geography, but she certainly understood
                    local politics, and Caribbean politics was very similar to electoral politics in
                    a small state. She was quite adept at dealing with all the various types of
                    people she met in the region, from the Prime Ministers to the local staff at the
                    Embassy. In short, she was very effective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this is one of the things that I have picked up in
                        these interviews I have done, that often politicians who get jobs can sit
                        down and talk to the politicians in the country to which they are assigned
                        on a much more practical and understanding position than a Foreign Service
                        officer who never had to meet a ballot.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: That is right. She was excellent, but in all fairness it's hard to say
                    whether her predecessor would have been good or not since he did not have too
                    much time to demonstrate his skills. .</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0173" n="Page0173"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the British, I guess it would be high
                        commissioner, the one during the Grenada invasion or intrusion or whatever
                        you want to call it, did not get on too well, was not too happy. The British
                        government, the country's unhappiness, was not pleased with the fact that we
                        went in there although we had more at stake than they did. By the time you
                        were there what was the British-American relationship on the island?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Absolutely wonderful. We were the best of buddies, if I can put it that
                    way. Let me rephrase that. The first British Resident Representative (ResRep)
                    and I overlapped only briefly; while we were very cordial, we were not close.
                    The second ResRep, however, was someone who had spent considerable time serving
                    in various capacities at British Consulates in the U.S., knew the states well
                    and enjoyed his time there. We were very good friends. In fact, when I returned
                    to visit a year or so later, I stayed with him and his wife. Not only was the
                    relationship close, but there was a strong sense of our being in this together,
                    the big kids in the neighborhood who had to cooperate. We actually got together
                    quite often with the representative from the OAS for lunch and discussion of
                    local issues. Basically, we tried to foster an esprit de corps among the local
                    diplomats, especially since we were all thrown together quite often. For the
                    most part, it was a compatible group. And we definitely cooperated with the
                    Brits on security and drug enforcement programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were your relations when you were there with the
                        government? Was this one where you could sit down and have a meaningful talk
                        with the prime minister and others or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Yes. I understand, having just visited Grenada, that the current Charg�
                    calls on the Prime Minister quite often. I did not — didn't want to overdo my
                    welcome. It made sense to me to call on him when I had something relevant to
                    report, but people differ and there's no right answer. The problem was that it
                    was easier to approach to government when you also had something to offer that
                    was of interest to them. Unfortunately, all too often, we made demarches,
                    calling on them to take specific actions but there was not necessarily something
                    for them in return. I did not have wiggle room to be able to provide meaningful
                    aid. Later on, after hurricane Ivan, there was more substantive assistance,
                    which I assume made things easier. And as I said before, both the Prime Minister
                    and the Foreign Minister had spent years in the U.S. and felt quite at home
                    there and with us. In, on occasion the Prime Minister seemed to forget himself
                    and speak as though he were an American, musing about “what we should be doing”
                    about one thing or another. I tried to keep from smiling because I don't think
                    he really meant to say it quite that way. In any case, relations were generally
                    fine.</p>
                <pb facs="0174" n="Page0174"/>
                <p>As for Foreign Minister Nimrod, he was very Americanized and seemed to know more
                    about U.S. history than his own. When the first ambassador of my tenure came to
                    present his credentials, the Foreign Minister hosted a very amiable lunch. Mr.
                    Nimrod clearly enjoyed talking about North Carolina and other parts of the U.S.
                    where he had spent considerable time. At one point our ambassador, demonstrating
                    that he had done his homework, asked about the current state of play regarding
                    the Windward Island Federation (a long standing project to unite the four
                    Windward Island states). Specifically, he asked whether there would, in fact, be
                    a unified Windward Island government. The Foreign Minister had a slightly blank
                    look on his face. He really was not up on the Windward Islands Federation, a
                    plan much discussed during the years he had been studying and working in the
                    U.S. Since I had focused a great deal on this project during my earlier tour in
                    the Caribbean, I teased him a bit, saying we ought to switch roles, since he
                    knew so much more about the U.S. than the West Indies. I said it jokingly but he
                    allowed that this was probably correct. So yes, we were friendly enough.</p>
                <p>But they did not agree with us on any number of issues, and they had their own
                    objectives. Scholarships were a case in point, and a topic they constantly
                    raised. Apparently, President Reagan had promised hundreds of scholarships for
                    Grenadian students. What happened to these scholarships, the Grenadians wanted
                    to know. There were, in fact, various scholarship programs used by Grenadian
                    students to attend American university, but we don not have a specific
                    USG-sponsored undergraduate scholarship program for students coming from the
                    Caribbean. The Cubans, on the other hand, were very generous with scholarships
                    for anyone wishing to study medicine or other subjects in Cuba — hundreds of
                    scholarships of this type were readily available. The PM would often throw it up
                    to me that we could win on much goodwill through scholarships and subsequently
                    good jobs for Grenadians in the U.S. He would in turn stress the absence of jobs
                    for Grenadians in Grenada. Unfortunately, we're not in a position to encourage
                    greater migration to the U.S. for ill-defined jobs. That is not our primary
                    objective as diplomats.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get many calls from members of Congress about

                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Some. We also had a few CODELs as well as a very interesting
                    Presidential delegation to commemorate the 20th anniversary of our intervention.
                    As for congressmen and staffers, they frequently called on behalf of some
                    constituent or a rich, politically plugged in friend, who might be West Indian
                    or American, who invariably had a made from their residence in the West Indies
                    that they wanted to take to their other home in the U.S. They, the prominent
                    individuals, always insisted they could vouch for the person in their employ. I
                    would try my best to explain our regulations in a nutshell to them as well as
                    the fact that no one could truly vouch for another adult human being, who could
                    readily walk out their door and remain in Kansas or wherever. But, yes, we did
                    have many such calls.</p>

                        play.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: That is right. And the stories are never ending. Just recently when I
                    was visiting in Grenada, I attended a dinner party and an American guest told me
                    about someone there who was returning to the States and wanted her employee to
                    come visit, but she did not want to spend the time or money required to go to
                    Bridgetown to apply for a visa. This led to a discussion of how good it was when
                    Grenadians were able to obtain visas in country. That, by the way, was something
                    that won us enormous goodwill for a period, but it didn't last. For a time, I
                    was able to get a consular officer from Bridgetown to come over once a month or
                    so to do visa interview in Grenada, thereby saving locals the cost of a
                    roundtrip and pricey ticket to Bridgetown for an interview. This was
                    discontinued, but it was truly popular.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do when you came back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I came back to work as an Office Director in the Bureau of Human Rights
                    and Democracy and served as the editor-in-chief responsible for the Department's
                    annual human rights reports; since we also dealt with asylum issues, the office
                    was called “Country Reports and Asylum Affairs” or DRL/CRA. It was a fascinating
                    experience in that I have never had a similar assignment. I was the only active
                    duty Foreign Service Officer in an office with a staff that varied in size from
                    about a dozen or so on the low end to approximately 35-40 during our “eak”
                    period when we were producing the human rights reports. The vast majority of
                    this “surge” consisted of WAEs. To explain, the core staff, who were there year
                    round were mainly civil servants or presidential management fellows, or other
                    special types of entry personnel, including interns, if you will. But for
                    several months during the year, we would augment our staff with WAEs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These are When Actually Employed, i.e., retired Foreign
                        Service people.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0176" n="Page0176"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: Exactly. All were retired Foreign Service personnel, many of whom had
                    been quite senior Foreign Service officers, who would return for several months
                    at a time to work as editors of the human rights report. It was a very
                    interesting staff composition, wherein there were some very junior people just
                    entering the workforce or student interns, combined with very senior retired
                    FSOs, which made for a very interesting group. And we edited more than 170
                    reports from all over the world — including every country but our own, plus some
                    areas that are officially not recognized countries as well. The first drafts
                    were always produced at post, after which we would do considerably editing —
                    both stylistic and substantive because there was frequently a certain degree of
                    clientism reflected in the initial drafts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, tell me about- all I can think about this is the
                        pressures that must be on you. You know, I can think of a couple of cases,
                        particularly China is one and of course Israel is a problem. And they were
                        probably above your pay grade, was it not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I got into the middle of it, and I will tell you how it works. I used to
                    joke that even a lowly editor could handle the conflicts or pressures emanating
                    from posts in the less developed parts of the world. What I mean by that is not
                    exactly the same as how the term is generally used. Rather, there is somewhat of
                    a hierarchy in terms of the reports. Looking at them with a very critical eye,
                    one could honestly say that 70 percent of the reports were really first rate.
                    And those are often reports, the best reports, with the most honest reporting,
                    are produced for countries with which we are not terribly involved. In other
                    words, it is relatively easy to do an excellent job, a truly honest report when
                    pressures and clientism is minimal. There are, exceptions, of course. One
                    example that comes to mind was Rwanda, where for several years the editor
                    responsible for the report would wind up battling it out with the post, and even
                    prompting the Ambassador to way in on occasion. In general, however, in much of
                    Africa, and actually in much of the world, the issues were manageable, at least
                    from the perspective of editing human rights reports. Likewise, reports on
                    countries that were widely or universally deemed as “bad” caused us relatively
                    few difficulties.</p>
                <pb facs="0177" n="Page0177"/>
                <p>In fact, in some cases involving the “worst offenders”, we occasionally had to
                    hold the line to prevent posts from painting an already dark situation even
                    darker. Or to put it differently, posts might include instances or examples in
                    their drafts that would never see the light of day elsewhere. In one of our
                    least favorite countries, drafting officers tended to include even trivial
                    incidents — someone brushing past a “victim” with a potted plant that touched
                    the person — and calling it abuse. Well, there is plenty of real abuse without
                    having to mention potted palms. In general, though, we could handle whatever
                    pressure we faced in dealing with these worst case countries. Nevertheless, we
                    did face pressure from various quarters, including some from posts in the
                    so-called best countries — in human rights terms — that did not want any
                    criticisms at all in the reports. The fact is that all countries, even the best,
                    have some problems and can usually handle a bit of criticism. Even so, I recall
                    one case in which a country had an indigenous population that was not
                    consistently well treated. Yet, the government in question balked —or our
                    Embassy there did — at any negative references to the treatment of this group.
                    And so it goes.</p>
                <p>But then you had roughly a dozen up to 20 countries, mostly in the Middle East,
                    parts of Central Asia or South Asia that were dealt with in more political
                    terms. In these parts, the key question was how to characterize certain
                    developments or events. And I have to say that the best thing that ever happened
                    to us in this regard was the very existence of a number of organizations such as
                    Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, which provided a counterbalancing
                    or countervailing, if you will, pressure to the “clientism” of certain posts.
                    Their pressure on us was to “tell it like it is”. This was a very real pressure
                    because if Human Rights Watch or Amnesty investigated claims of abuses in a
                    particularly country which may have been an ally of ours, we invariably would go
                    back to our posts and seek clarifications of the allegations provided. Even
                    though our posts might argue that the NGOS in question might have their own
                    particular agenda, the fact that they had widely publicized an incident
                    compelled us to at least acknowledge the allegations or simply the fact that a
                    case had been widely publicized — thereby casting further light upon it. This is
                    where the pressure would escalate — reaching my level and up the chain of
                    command. I vividly recall receiving an e-mail that had been sent to our
                    Assistant Secretary and myself from a very well-known ambassador in which the
                    latter stressed that he and his staff had tried to cooperate and work with DRL
                    but that we were not bending. Specifically, he maintained that we were being
                    inflexible in seeking to include information about an attack by the host
                    government on its own citizens in a border region. He indicated he understood
                    the pressure we were under from NGOs but wanted to ensure that we conveyed in
                    our report that the government in question had done its best to minimize
                    civilian casualties. I responded to the e-mail by thanking the ambassador
                    profusely for his understanding but explained that the purpose of the reports
                    was not only to be factual but in a sense “deadly dull” in that we did not use
                    “colorful language” or ascribe motivations to various players. Specifically, we
                    could not claim that a government did its very best to prevent civilian
                    casualties, etc., but could simply note it had taken measures toward this end.
                    Ultimately the ambassador said he could live with such a statement, and that's
                    what we said.</p>

                        know, all objectivity is off on Israel. I mean, how did you find this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Painful, because everything else was more or less negotiable. Just to
                    get it on the record some of the other consistently problematic cases — and
                    there was usually at least one per continent — should be mentioned before moving
                    on to Israel. After all, there were a number of headline makers that involved
                    serious issues and in some cases abuses that warrant mention. Colombia, for
                    example, was always a complicated case, not necessarily because it was a worst
                    offender but rather due to the fact that the situation in Colombia was a classic
                    case of a glass half full or half empty and our dilemma was one of focus — how
                    much to emphasize improvements, which were real, versus continuing abuses, which
                    likewise existed. Obviously, we also had to deal with the continuing problems
                    and abuses in countries allied to us, especially those engaged in the “war on
                    terror”, such as Pakistan. Then too, there were newspaper articles in the New
                    York Times and Washington Post and on-line pieces dealing with the rendition
                    issue, which we had to address in some fashion.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might explain what a rendition is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: The way the term is used today involves the act of sending people to
                    prisons in other countries that perhaps have less restrictions on how prisoners
                    are treated than we do in the U.S. where they might, in fact, be tortured. In
                    specific media reports, the term was also linked to what became known as “black
                    prisons” or facilities in friendly countries, particularly in Europe. Although
                    not “proven”, the media strongly alleged that individuals who were deemed
                    possible terrorist threats were sent to special facilities to be “interrogated”
                    before being “transited” elsewhere — and I deliberately put this in the passive
                    voice. And the question then arose for us stemmed from the outcry from a
                    regional bureau, which was always proud of the high standards of human rights in
                    the region, over how we would dare to write about their countries in conjunction
                    will allegations of human rights violations in these so-called black
                    prisons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking about basically in the European
                        bureau.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Yes. Specifically, counterparts in the European Bureau challenged our
                    inclusion of the countries involved in these renditions as violators by claiming
                    that if “their countries” were involved in such renditions, they were probably
                    doing so at our behest or in order to please us; therefore, EUR insisted we
                    should refrain from citing such possible cases in Europe. That was one instance
                    of bureau pushback in which we lost. Consequently, the newspapers wrote freely
                    about the renditions to European facilities — naming countries — but we could
                    not. Q:</p>

                    <pb facs="0179" n="Page0179"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say lost it, who was winning?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Well, let me rephrase the notion of battles lost in the context of human
                    rights reporting. We all became clientists in different ways, but our clientism
                    was centered on our own image of the truth. While we recognized that there were
                    certain topics that simply could not be covered, our basic premise was that we
                    had to “tell it like it is”. It was not appropriate for the New York Times to
                    publish articles dealing with events that we could not acknowledge or even
                    acknowledge allegations related to the incident. My usage of the term “lost”
                    refers to cases in which we knew that something had happened or was alleged to
                    have happened to be more precise but could not mention it. By contrast, a
                    victory, would have been to recognize that the media or NGOs had alleged that
                    such and such had transpired. More often than not, the references or allegations
                    would be attributed to Human Rights Watch, some other credible source, or
                    occasionally, albeit rarely “unconfirmed” sources. Ideally, we only cited truly
                    reputable sources who could confirm actual events; however, there were rare
                    occasions, particularly in countries with bad human rights records or where
                    access was denied making it difficult to confirm sources, where we had to note
                    the allegation without hard evidence or confirmation. And there were always case
                    in certain Middle Eastern countries where torture was regularly alleged.</p>
                <p>In fact, after Abu Ghraib became known, information came out that certain
                    individuals who may have engaged in suspicious behaviors might have suffered
                    uncomfortable levels of interrogations — whether you define it as torture or not
                    is another question. However, there would invariably be instances in the region
                    where either an ambassador or someone in authority at post or in the regional
                    bureau would weigh in strongly, in effect insisting that certain information
                    should not be included in the report. Such practices continue. You may have seen
                    Al Kamen's “In the Loop” piece a few weeks ago in which he wrote of a supposedly
                    leaked State Department e-mail between a Deputy Assistant Secretary in a
                    regional bureau and a Deputy Assistant Secretary in DRL regarding whether it was
                    really necessary to use particular language about the human rights situation in
                    a country with which we were currently engaged in delicate negotiations. How
                    this e-mail found its way into the newspaper was unclear. Al Kamen obviously has
                    excellent sources. But leaks of this sort could be considered a serious breach;
                    yet, I don't think anything subsequently happened.</p>
                <p>To get back to the subject at hand, topping our pyramid of difficulty were the
                    two reports for Israel and the Occupied Territories. Essentially, these were
                    scrutinized, edited and re-edited multiple times; sometimes, it came down to
                    very small issues. It seemed hard to believe that they would arouse so much
                    passion at the NSC but they did. One of the more interesting cases I had to deal
                    with was the now well-known story of Rachel Corrie, a young woman who died after
                    being run over by a bulldozer in the West Bank town of Ramallah. Are you
                    familiar with this case?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0180" n="Page0180"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: Actually a theater in London produced a play on Rachel's story, which
                    was supposed to open in New York, but it was cancelled at the last moment.
                    Meanwhile, Rachel's family was committed to ensuring that that the truth about
                    what happened to their daughter, whatever it was, would emerge. The family
                    maintained that Rachel was in Ramallah as part of a peace-oriented international
                    organization — deemed by many to be pro-Palestinian in orientation — that sought
                    to prevent the tearing down of buildings and homes in the West Bank, especially
                    in Ramallah. Bulldozers, Israeli bulldozers, were operating in the area, and
                    members of the group would position themselves in front of the machinery. In the
                    case of Rachel, this resulted in her being bulldozed to death, raising countless
                    questions about why and how. Did the operator see her or not, was his action
                    deliberate, under orders? These were the kinds of issues that emerged. The
                    family wanted a real investigation, not the cursory review they believed had
                    actually been carried out. Moreover, prior to my arrival on the job, the family
                    had submitted a Freedom of Information request for information on the case, and
                    the documents obtained indicated that there had not, in fact, been a thorough
                    investigation. Specifically, there was material from the Consulate in Jerusalem
                    confirming the view that the Israelis had not carried out a thorough
                    investigation of Rachel's death. Given this background, the question for us was
                    how to deal with this case in the human rights report, and the issue received
                    considerable congressional attention, especially from representatives from their
                    home states. Further complicating the situation was the fact that this family in
                    many ways seemed to represent the best of America or the perfect American
                    family. The father had served in the U.S. military. He did not want money or to
                    be “bought off” in any way. The whole family was wholesome looking and
                    appealing; all they wanted, they insisted, was full disclosure. Yet, from other
                    perspectives, full disclosure was not necessarily regarded as a good thing. In
                    addition, we were somewhat hamstrung by our own “three-year rule”, whereby if
                    there were no major developments in a particular case or related to an incident
                    after three years, it would not be covered in the annual human rights report,
                    except in very rare cases. Needless to say, in a case such as that of Rachel
                    Corrie, an enormous amount of energy and seemingly endless debate — often at
                    very high levels, including the NSC — went into discussions related what was
                    included in the report.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, in the NSC, would these be political appointees
                        who were- I mean, the people who were objecting or doing this, were they
                        looking at it really from a political point of view as opposed to a truth
                        point of view?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I should probably mention that the acting Assistant Secretary for DRL
                    when I arrived at the job was Mike Kozak, whose career up to that point could
                    not be neatly characterized as political. He had been a career civil servant at
                    State, initially as a lawyer, but later served as Chief of our Interest Section
                    in Havana and as Ambassador to Belarus. He cared passionately about issues
                    related to democracy and human rights. After DRL, he was seconded to the NSC
                    where he worked directly for Elliot Abrams, and Elliot Abrams seemingly was
                    equally passionate about the Israel/Occupied Territories report.</p>
                <pb facs="0181" n="Page0181"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well yes, Elliott Abrams came from, I mean, is the name
                        that keeps coming up. I mean, it comes out of the Neo-Con, New York Jewish
                        intelligentsia. So he represents, if one wants to call it that, a Jewish
                        constituency in the body politic he is part of it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I'm not sure whether that's an apt description. I certainly know many
                    individuals in the Department, who while Jewish, take diametrically opposing
                    views on this and other issues related to Israel and are hardly neo-cons. It's
                    not strictly a Jewish issue but in a broader sense, part of a more complicated
                    set of issues related to Israel, particularly for many who might be Jewish.
                    Regarding the reports, one set of questions or arguments centers on the
                    standards used in the production of the reports and whether the Israeli report
                    is held to the same or different standards from other reports. According to one
                    viewpoint, there is a need for a fair or level playing field. Specifically, the
                    argument goes that there are enough people already beating up on Israel for its
                    treatment of the occupied territories — in the UN and other fora — that we
                    should not “pile it on” by adding countless and perhaps gratuitous examples of
                    abuses. And I do understand that position. However, there has been a tendency
                    during the past few years for the Israeli report to be “slashed” in length, by
                    as much as a third, either by or at the behest of the NSC. Actually, the
                    situation was more complicated than that. For starters, the staff at ConGen
                    Jerusalem would not always agree with Embassy personnel in Tel Aviv on certain
                    aspects of the report, and they in turn might not see eye to eye with the Near
                    East Bureau (NEA) back in the Department, with whom we might have had some
                    differences — especially with their lawyers — and only then would NSC get into
                    the act. Very often, we would find ourselves negotiating on many levels — first
                    the post or posts in the case of Israel, and then just when we believed we had
                    reached agreement within the Department on language for any one of a number of
                    disputed issues within the reports — as I mentioned there were separate reports
                    for Israeland the Occupied Territories — they would be sent to the NSC where
                    they would effectively be gutted or at least substantially rewritten, which
                    virtually never occurred with other reports.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, who had final say?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0182" n="Page0182"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: That, too, was complicated, but in this case, the NSC had the final
                    word. In probably 95 percent of the reports, DRL with the concurrence of the
                    Ambassador had the final say, because the NSC did not challenge us much on the
                    other reports. There might be a few differences, quibbles or recommended
                    changes, but we basically had a civilized discussion with NSC staff regarding
                    this. In other words, not only did the NSC not interfere in most reports but NSC
                    suggestions regarding language or constructive criticisms about a particular
                    point were often quite useful. So this is in no way a major criticism of the NSC
                    role vis-a-vis the human rights reports overall. In general, relations with the
                    NSC were fairly amicable, and most of our battles tended to be internal or with
                    ambassadors at posts. But on the Israel report, while we could quibble on minor
                    points after the NSC made its determination, they rarely budged on key issues.
                    Technically, we always said the ambassadors had the final word, and that was
                    often the case, but not in this instance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was there an opportunity as there are in
                        intelligence reports to footnote it?In other words to say this came out
                        straight, I mean, no qualifiers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Not exactly. Leaving aside Israel and the Occupied Territories,
                    generally if there were strongly divergent sources of information about an
                    incident or case of abuse, we would normally acknowledge them as such. For
                    example, take the Philippines, where they may have been some incident in
                    Mindanao about which we had limited or questionable information or no first hand
                    sources but lots of hearsay. What we would do in such cases was to note that
                    there were conflicting reports or competing credible sources, sometimes even
                    acknowledging the dearth of reliable data. The problem with the Israel report
                    was quite different. There the issue was one of sheer volume. We had tons of
                    information, but had to grapple with how much to include, specifically how many
                    different kinds of cases or examples should one cite or whether to include
                    certain incidents at all. Again, there was no shortage of source material, but
                    simply, from the NSC perspective, whether all that data was necessary or by
                    “piling it on”, we were being needlessly prejudicial to Israel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, on the Corrie thing, how did it come out?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0183" n="Page0183"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: I guess you could say it was basically a draw. There were certain
                    modifications in our coverage over the years, and the case of Rachel Corrie did
                    come up three years in a row while I was there; subsequently, it was not
                    mentioned because of the so-called three-year rule. We also had different
                    assistant secretaries during that time and attitudes toward the Corrie case
                    shifted a bit. What the family wanted went beyond changes in the human rights
                    report, and certain of their requests could only be addressed by the regional
                    bureau. But, I do recall one event from early in my tenure in DRL that is worth
                    noting, namely a meeting hosted by Secretary Powell's Chief of Staff Col. Larry
                    Wilkerson, who had come over to State with Powell. In fact, he had been attached
                    to Powell for much of his career. You probably have heard of him or familiar
                    with his name since he has been quite outspoken in his comments on various radio
                    programs and in the press in recent years, saying things that Secretary Powell
                    might have wished to say but could not, notably regarding his views on
                    discovering the absence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, etc. In any
                    event, the Corrie family had contacted him, and Wilkerson met with them several
                    times, asking for updates and indicating he would follow up personally with
                    regard to their requests. In sum, there was considerable high level interest in
                    this case, both in our chain of command and on the Hill. We tried to be as
                    forthright as possible with the family. I remember telling them that we would
                    bend over backwards to try to meet their legitimate concerns but there were
                    certain things we could not do — in any of our country reports, not just Israel.
                    For example, we would not say that State Department officer John Doe said “x or
                    y” since we simply did not use our own officers as sources or cite them in the
                    report. So the family did not get everything it wanted on that score.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you did this until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I did this from the summer of 2004 when I returned from Grenada. I
                    intended at the time to make this my last two year Foreign Service tour, and I
                    found it very satisfying, rewarding in many ways despite the internal battles I
                    previously mentioned. In some respects, the office represented the best of the
                    Foreign Service in the sense that there were really decent, intelligent people
                    working at something they believed in, doing the best they could in a very
                    collegial environment, at least within our own shop. We were a bit removed from
                    other issues of the day. The staff felt as though we were really on the side of
                    the angels. After I had been there for a year or so, I decided I would like to
                    extend, if possible, my tenure in the job for another year before retiring.
                    However, my initial job did not last quite that long because a new assistant
                    secretary decided to change the configuration of the Bureau and in turn the
                    parameters of my job. In other words, while I did extend for a year, the
                    assignment I had during the last period was quite different from that of the
                    first two years. So my job as editor-in -chief of the human rights report lasted
                    two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So then you retired, is that-?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0184" n="Page0184"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: No, as I mentioned, I extended for an additional year. What happened was
                    that at the end of the initial two-year period, the bureau itself was
                    reconfigured, and I became the Office Director for a new office that dealt with
                    Asia and Western Hemisphere issues within DRL, with somewhat different
                    responsibilities. While I was still an office director, the office itself was
                    now responsible for both the human rights reports for these regions and for the
                    promotion of human rights and democracy in the area. As you can imagine, this
                    also entailed a shift in orientation. In the “old” regime, the staff saw itself
                    as maintaining its lily white purity because the office was not obliged to
                    actually promote anything, beyond obvious human rights goals. In other words,
                    the former office personnel functioned more or less as analysts, writers and
                    editors, but we did not, to use the vernacular, tell anyone how to suck
                    eggs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I am looking at the time and Nadia, do you mind
                        coming one more time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: That would be great to wrap it up.</p>
                <p>Today is the 8th of April, 2008; Nadia, let us talk about your last assignment.
                    You were in the human rights bureau, were you not?</p>
                <p>TONGOUR: That is right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the head of the human rights bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: During my three years in DRL, we actually had three separate individuals
                    at the helm. The first was Mike Kozak, who I spoke of earlier and who moved over
                    to the NSC. After his departure, we briefly had a career Foreign Service Officer
                    named Glynn Davies as Acting Assistant Secretary. He subsequently became the
                    Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary (DAS) in the East Asia Bureau. Finally, I
                    served under Barry Lowenkron who left around the same time I did to work for a
                    private foundation. So, there was quite a variety of work styles and paper
                    requirements.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were doing this from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I returned from my last overseas posting in the summer of 2004 and
                    started in DRL just in time to begin work on the annual human rights report.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. What did we cover, do you remember, on the human
                        rights reports or had we gotten into it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0185" n="Page0185"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: We had just started discussing the work of the office and various
                    divisions within the bureau. One interesting separation or divide stemmed from
                    the fact that my office was physically separate from the rest of the bureau. We
                    were located in “SA-1”, otherwise known as Columbia Plaza, which had its
                    advantages but also made us feel somewhat apart from the others in DRL.
                    Occasionally, we felt as though we were the orphan children of the bureau, which
                    was ironic in that every year, or rather once a year, our assistant secretary
                    would proclaim to Congress and the media just how important were the annual
                    human rights reports. For much of the rest of the year, however, there was a
                    sense of our simply being out of sight, out of minds. Yet, during those few
                    months when we were churning out the reports, there was some attention paid to
                    the work of the office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the main, I mean, I imagine most of them are
                        fairly routine, but where were the sticking points of these reports?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I think the main disease is clientitis, which we've discussed at some
                    length before. Obviously many individuals wanted to ensure that while the
                    reports were fair, they also took into account existing problems or
                    circumstances in a given country. Moreover, there were roughly a dozen
                    countries, primarily in the NEA (Near East) and South Asia Bureaus where because
                    of post - 9/11 developments, we had to rely on the support of these countries in
                    the war against terrorism; consequently, there were issues related to how we
                    covered their actions and behaviors. Essentially our biggest problem was how to
                    depict X, Y, or Z activities in specific countries that under normal
                    circumstances could be regarded as torture or, at a minimum, human rights
                    abuse.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you mention the word “torture” we are coming up to
                        the present era where, particularly under the Bush Administration, torture,
                        to the repugnance of many people, including myself, torture is sort of
                        condoned. How did we treat that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Well, we fought the proverbial good fight as best we could. We're
                    diplomats, after all, and we understood our limits. Still, we had to deal with a
                    new phenomenon, which probably warrants mention, namely the increasing
                    encroachment of lawyers into the process of producing these reports. Until a few
                    years ago, we adhere to the dictum of an earlier DRL Assistant Secretary, who
                    insisted that the Department's lawyers stay out of the business of writing human
                    rights reports. His position — and one we tried to uphold — was that the reports
                    were not legal documents but were intended to serve as our best estimates of
                    conditions around the world. In other words, this particular Assistant
                    Secretary, himself a lawyer, sought to keep the Department's lawyers at arms
                    length.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the problem with the lawyers in his perception or
                        her perception?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0186" n="Page0186"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: His perception was that he wanted us to be as honest as we could be. He
                    wasn't saying “damn the consequences” but at the same time, he did not want a
                    protective cadre of lawyers trying to expunge materials from the reports which
                    might not be palatable to one office or constituency or another. And more or
                    less, at least in the beginning, we were able to do this. We would certainly
                    share our drafts with the lawyers and listen to their suggestions, but they did
                    not have veto authority. Increasingly, over the years, lawyers, particularly
                    those dealing with Middle Eastern issues, would weigh in more and more. This is
                    not to blame them. However, you asked how we dealt with the question of torture,
                    and increasingly we were forced to split hairs. For example, we were told not to
                    use the word “torture” except in very rare case. On the other hand, we were
                    allowed to describe actions. Initially we did use the word “torture” when the
                    term seemed appropriate, but by my last year in the bureau, the editors were
                    very much restricted in their usage of this word.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, say on the torture thing, which of course is not a
                        minor issue at all; in fact, it has been very much to the detriment of
                        American foreign policy and our moral stand, but were the lawyers
                        responding, would you say they were looking at this as a political thing in
                        order to cover the administration's stand or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I don't want to accuse anyone of excessive cynicism. Who knows what
                    happened after I left, and really don't want to speculate on later reports, but
                    in any case the situation became quite “convoluted” and not very pretty. Here
                    again, we need to be careful on this score because even earlier we were
                    grappling with the often raised question of how did we dare to judge others when
                    we were guilty of certain misdeeds of our own. This is a fundamental question
                    that the rest of the world is not shy about asking us. Our standard response was
                    that we did not pretend to be perfect but we tried to correct our mistakes;
                    moreover, we were not writing a report on ourselves. Rather, we would leave that
                    to others while we concentrated on the rest of the world. There were certainly
                    ambassadors, lawyers and heads of regional bureaus who repeatedly raised two key
                    arguments. First, how could we judge country X with regard to a particular
                    action when country X claimed it was doing it either at our behest or for our
                    benefit. For example, if a monstrous person came through their country and they
                    interrogated him, albeit roughly, and in so doing protected the world from a
                    terrorist attack, were they abusers or human rights violators. We heard
                    rationalizations related to the “lesser evil” a great deal, particularly couched
                    in terms to the effect that “they were doing it to help us.” In addition to this
                    set of arguments, we often got the message that not every abuse needed to be
                    spelled out. In other words, there were enough other factors detrimental to our
                    war on terror that we didn't need to advertise every problem. And then, too,
                    there were instances that did not involve the Middle East where we faced certain
                    awkward situations. For example, as a case in point, both The New York Times and
                    The Washington Post carried front page stories about facilities in European
                    countries that were being used as rendition centers to detain potential
                    prisoners in transit to other less “enlightened” countries in terms of their
                    treatment of possible terrorists.</p>
                <pb facs="0187" n="Page0187"/>
                <p>In short, we certainly faced our share of pressure, and we tried our best to be
                    fair and accurate; yet the problem of how to treat the actions of friendly
                    countries that are “helping us” in a cause or are allied in some effort,
                    remains.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were matters, from your perspective and I realize that
                        some of these battles got fought higher up, but how were matters
                        resolved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Quite honestly very few were resolved higher up. I think I might have
                    mentioned this last time, when I said a dozen, and I meant that literally.
                    Actually, most disputes were resolved at a lower level. In other words, if a
                    member of our Africa team, who truly understood the situation in Rwanda and had
                    spent considerable time working on that report during a temporary assignment in
                    country and wound up editing the report back here — if he disagreed with the
                    embassy, he usually had enough expertise to work it out on his own level with
                    post counterparts and negotiate the language to be included. He could easily
                    point out to post that we could not omit a particular atrocity since it had been
                    well documented or widely covered in the media. On the other hand, he might well
                    agree with the post that not every single incident had been fully shown to be
                    true, some questionable cases could be left out. Such discussions were common,
                    and most — 75 or 80 percent — could be readily resolved at the working
                    level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You could get the offices dealing with this go TDY to the
                        trouble spots?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I would like to talk about this further but to finish up on the prior
                    topic, we invariably wound up in a situation in which perhaps 10 percent of the
                    dispute would come to the attention of my deputy or myself, cases in which we
                    would talk to the relevant desk officers or to the DCM at post or even the
                    Ambassador in smaller countries in an attempt to reach an agreement.. And then
                    we were down to the last half dozen or so that would get “bounced up”, starting
                    at my level and then moving up to the DRL regional deputy assistant secretary
                    before reaching the principal DAS in a few case. In the end, there rarely more
                    than one or two that ever involved the Assistant Secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let us talk about the half dozen; which were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: The ones that I would get involved with?Q: Yes.</p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Essentially in Latin America the major disputes centered on Colombia,
                    with Haiti occasionally causing some difficulties. Colombia was definitely the
                    “problem child” among the Latin American reports.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0188" n="Page0188"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because of the drug wars there and the anti-drug wars and
                        the-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Our involvement and support for Colombian government efforts to combat
                    narco-trafficking. But, in terms of the report, the main problem was that during
                    this period we had an incredibly pro-active ambassador, who was was very
                    intelligent but passionate on issues involving his bailiwick. He not only read
                    the entire report but made his own line by line edits and would often insist on
                    very specific language. But this was a rather special case, and the only one in
                    the Western Hemisphere where the ambassador had such a hands on involvement. In
                    any case, the Colombia report received an inordinate amount of attention.</p>
                <p>Russia, also, was often the focal point of considerable interest, but there the
                    situation was different. It really was not a case of clientitis but rather the
                    fact that everyone working on the report in Embassy Moscow and the Consulates
                    really knew his stuff, which resulted in all sorts of almost philosophical
                    debates over nuances related to Russian practices.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: China I would imagine-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: China became a problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A huge problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: A huge problem because with China there were at least several different
                    interest groups in the pictures, with quite varied objectives and conflicting
                    orientations towards developments in the country, resulting in pitched internal
                    battles. Interesting enough though at the working level, people were often quite
                    good at resolving particular issues. The editor of the China report really
                    didn't need my help, although sometimes the negotiations over specific points or
                    language seemed to take forever. Occasionally, a dispute would escalate and be
                    handled at a considerably higher level.</p>
                <p>It's probably worth mentioning that almost every year there would be one totally
                    unexpected problem report, one that was never anticipated. One such example
                    comes to mind. An ambassador in a small European country happened to read the
                    previous year's report concerning a neighboring country and decided that the
                    human rights situation in the neighboring state was no better than in the
                    country to which she was accredited and insisted that the latter receive a more
                    favorable characterization than what might normally have been the case.</p>
                <pb facs="0189" n="Page0189"/>
                <p>I should probably explain that in my first year on the job, there was a system in
                    place, which has subsequently been eliminated, known as “holding sentences”
                    which were used to succinctly describe the overall human rights performance of a
                    given country. In other words, the introductory paragraphs of all the reports
                    followed a set format or structure, and in the fourth paragraph, let us say, we
                    would include one of five generic statements. For example, we might say that
                    country X generally respects the human rights of its people, etc. There were
                    five basic options to choose from and “generally respects” was the highest
                    accolade we could give.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is sort of an accolade by default almost.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: That is what the Europeans thought. Many of them wanted or believed they
                    deserved an unqualified “respects”. Our position was that there was no such
                    thing as a perfect country, warranting a 100 percent in terms of adherence to
                    human rights norms. Not surprisingly there were disputes over this — and we're
                    talking about the so-called high end countries here. Elsewhere, in truly bad or
                    even horrible situations, there were arguments over the language in the “holding
                    sentences” as well. Eventually we did away with using the holding sentences, but
                    we still have problems depicting the overall conditions in problematic countries
                    such as China, Colombia, Russia as well as much of the Near East and South Asia.
                    Mostly, as I said, the battles are resolvable at the working or Office Director
                    level. However, there are always a couple, notably Israel and the Occupied
                    Territories that require the highest levels of intervention within the Bureau,
                    regardless of who is in charge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I was wondering with Israel, we will come back to
                        the others but with Israel, I mean, this is a battle that has been fought
                        ever since the inception because the Israelis are pretty tough people. I
                        mean, they are under the gun and yet there are people who feel passionately
                        about them in the United States. Politically it is a third rail. But I would
                        think you would almost have a- things have not changed much over the years
                        so you could almost have a boilerplate Israeli thing representing how this
                        thing has been compromised out or something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Well, one might think so but I must say that every year I was in the
                    Bureau there was at least some dispute over the length of these reports and the
                    number of examples cited.</p>
                <p>Finally, I ought to tell you that the Cuba report was also problematic but for
                    different reasons, mainly stemming from the preponderance of “true believers” in
                    the evils of the regime, who regarded every aspect of life on the island as a
                    human rights violation. I am not being facetious here. The position we took in
                    our battles with the Cuba Desk was that battle we fight with the Cuba desk is
                    let us be real, folks. There are enough bad things to do in that country that we
                    do not need to use every minor instance of someone knocking into a potted palm.
                    So that is the other extreme of showing it as...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, is the hand of the Cuban exile community in Florida
                        trying to make you come up with more horrible things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: In this particular instance the Cuban exile community did not have
                    anything to say about the specifics of the report, but there was a certain
                    mindset that often affects people at post. In essence, they themselves begin to
                    feel a bit under siege, and they are obviously already empathetic to the
                    dissidents; consequently, there is a tendency to be hyper-observant of all the
                    ills in the country. I use this only as an example of a case where we had to
                    walk a post back and insist on using the same standards in Cuba as we use
                    anywhere elsewhere when describing human rights violations. If we talk about
                    people being killed in Burma, we talk about people killed in Cuba in the same
                    manner; likewise, other equivalent levels of abuse should be handled or
                    described in comparable terms. We don't need to look for gratuitous incidents or
                    pad the reports. So the “attack of the potted palm” I mentioned earlier didn't
                    make it in to the report Whereas in the case of Israel, there were many
                    interested parties seeking to ensure that we did not overdo it by including an
                    excessive number of cases in the report. Ironically, we were not “adding”
                    material; the data itself came from drafting officers working in Tel Aviv or
                    Jerusalem who provided the bulk of information used, which we subsequently
                    edited. But again, within the NSC the concern was that we not include too much.

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This has always been- Well, how about the foreign
                        embassies? I mean, do you get Israeli or Chinese diplomats coming in and
                        saying what the hell are you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Yes, but usually it would come up during a discussion of wider range of
                    issues. More often then not, such complaints would also occur at a higher level.
                    For instance, Ambassador X might call on the Secretary or the regional Assistant
                    Secretary to discuss 10 different items and in the discussion, cite specific
                    objections to the previous year's human rights report. As the office director, I
                    might have occasion to meet with an Ambassador or DCM from a smaller country,
                    such as Romania or Morocco or have contacts with the Taiwanese Mission, which
                    always sought to develop closer ties. As you know, we have all sorts of
                    restrictions on what we can do in terms of the Taiwanese. We also have a
                    separate report on Taiwan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and we do not have official representation there but
                        that is-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: We have an Interest Section there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Interest Section, and we do a report on Taiwan?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0191" n="Page0191"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: Absolutely. Overseas, the situation can be a bit tricky, especially in
                    countries such as Grenada which at the time I was there recognized Taiwan. As I
                    previously mentioned, Grenada had a very small diplomatic community, so one
                    would be thrown together with the Taiwanese representative, as well as the Cuban
                    Ambassador, on many different occasions. Our official “non-dealings” with the
                    Cubans are well known, but the rules regarding our interactions with the
                    Taiwanese representatives were somewhat arcane, yet quite interesting. I could
                    interact with the Taiwanese Ambassador in many venues. I could go to dinner, for
                    example at a restaurant — in other words, we could be seen in public. However, I
                    could not invite the Ambassador to our residence or to any official U.S.
                    function, nor could I attend their official functions or visit their residence.
                    So we got to know each other informally in local restaurants.</p>
                <p>Back to more recent events in DRL, many representatives would, in fact, call on
                    us and express their concerns about the human rights reports — and often their
                    concerns were quite random. Generally, they wanted to make sure we knew that
                    their human rights situation was improving. For examples, the Greeks insisted
                    they were not mistreating Macedonians, and New Zealanders wanted us to know that
                    they were currently quite correct in their treatment of indigenous people. These
                    were the kinds of issues we confronted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Egypt? I would think Egypt would be a
                        problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Egypt could be a problem, but what was more of an issue related to Egypt
                    was the fact that the Bush administration's policy toward Egypt vis-a-vis human
                    rights was inconsistent. Initially, the focus may have been on human rights, but
                    in subsequent years scant mention was made of the real abuses in that country —
                    making us look quite hypocritical.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, do you get, I mean, were you able to see
                        developments and- I mean, how did you feel about these reports? Were they
                        sort of going out there to everybody's- gnash their teeth and all but
                        nothing would happen or were you looking, you know, as keeping score; gee,
                        we are making some progress?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I think I mentioned earlier that in my office the staff often felt as
                    though our leadership barely noticed our existence except for a brief period
                    each year surrounding the release of the human rights reports. Then, the reports
                    did seem to really matter. This was demonstrated in various ways, including
                    messages from dissidents who would later thank us for mentioning specific
                    incidents or particular abuses, thereby keeping their concerns alive and
                    possibly preventing further abuse or keeping the lid on repression. In the days
                    after the release of the country reports, there would be more than a hundred
                    thousand computer hits, with people all over the world reading parts of the
                    report.</p>
                <pb facs="0192" n="Page0192"/>
                <p>I think it's probably worth mentioning that for most of the staff in DRL,
                    especially those working in the Country Reports Office (CRA), there was often a
                    sense being on the side of the angels, at least some of the time. In turn, they
                    tended to feel quite strongly when they were pressed to include information they
                    did not feel was accurate or to delete information they believed important. They
                    took it personally. For the most part, though, we saw ourselves as generally
                    winning our battles, and during that period we received a great deal of positive
                    feedback from NGOs such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, as well
                    as the Hill, and we took that to heart as well.</p>
                <p>That said, as we've already discussed, there were a few instances where reports
                    were substantially “edited” at a higher level, and that definitely was not seen
                    as a victory by the staff. .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, on something as human rights reports, obviously this
                        stirs the emotions and particularly, oversimplifying, but younger officers,
                        I mean, who, you know, after you have been ground down in a bureaucracy you
                        understand compromises have to be made and the political realities. But when
                        you are a fairly new officer, yes we have all been through that, both
                        stages; did you have problems of almost revolts on your staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I'll tell you where there were almost revolts, and this sort segues into
                    the next phase of my tour. Although there were some individuals who really felt
                    they did not want to make necessary compromises, they generally tended to leave
                    — rather than revolt — after a while. These cases were rare. I took some pride
                    in the fact that I could generally persuade those who were initially disgruntled
                    to stay by highlighting how much they had, in fact, achieved and how many
                    battles they had won, as well as occasionally using the argument based on the
                    old clich� of knowing when to “fold 'em” that it was important to know when to
                    fight and when to let go. No one likes to concede in crucial cases, but most
                    were quite professional and generally stuck it out because they believed in the
                    overall goal.</p>
                <pb facs="0193" n="Page0193"/>
                <p>Problems arose in my second year when our new assistant secretary — believing
                    there was a poor allocation of work among the various offices — decided to
                    reconfigure the bureau. He believed quite rightly that CRA had an unusual work
                    cycle with six or seven months of difficult work and a few months where we
                    really did not have an excessive amount to do. Of course the staff had work
                    since we also covered asylum cases, requiring the review of substantial numbers
                    of documents. People also did TDY assignments, including travel and support for
                    other bureaus. This proved to be a real win-win situation for all because if an
                    officer was working on Africa and had the opportunity to go to the Central
                    African Republic to work for a couple of months, he could both help the post
                    fill a staffing gap and gather materials for the human rights report, not to
                    mention acquire additional expertise in the area. We had a very, very limited
                    travel budget combined with young officers keen on traveling to their posts. So
                    I developed a plan for stretching our few dollars, based on the notion of
                    reaching out to the regional bureaus or posts and asking them to help defray
                    some of the costs. In other words, if they wanted to have a TDYer spend the
                    summer in Rwanda, then what could they offer in terms of support. Specifically,
                    could they provide housing or partial per diem or even airfare? In sum, what
                    could we ask posts to provide so as to enable our personnel to travel there and
                    make a real contribution? For distant posts, we found this particularly useful
                    since sending a person to India was truly a costly proposition in terms of
                    airfare. If a post could help with the airfare or housing, it made it much
                    easier to spread our meager resources around. I took a lot of pride in being
                    able to stretch our budget so that virtually everyone got a trip, either an
                    orientation trip to a country on which he worked or a couple of month TDY to a
                    post in their region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say “TDY” for somebody who is not-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Temporary duty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Temporary duty, which would mean that they would go and
                        fill in as a political officer or a consular officer or something like
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Exactly. Typically in many countries, especially in the so-called Third
                    World, posts might have a very small political section, and staff would need to
                    go on leave or would be transferred; there were inevitable staffing gaps. To
                    have someone, particularly someone knowledgeable about human rights and
                    political developments in the region who could fill in was enormously helpful to
                    the post as well as gratifying for the officer. Moreover, it provided them a
                    real change. While editing human rights report is certainly meaningful and
                    worthwhile, at times it can become quite tedious, and involve incredibly long
                    hours, especially toward the end of the cycle. These TDYs were a great treat and
                    would break up the workload.</p>
                <pb facs="0194" n="Page0194"/>
                <p>However, our assistant secretary was concerned that another office in the bureau,
                    which was responsible for actually promoting democracy was overworked year
                    round. He thought that by merging our two offices and then dividing the
                    resulting office into geographical units, the new configuration would allow
                    everyone to do some of everything, with a more balanced workload in the process.
                    This was a very good idea in theory and ultimately has worked well enough in
                    practice; yet getting from point A to point B was quite a painful process for
                    some, basically for the very reason you mentioned earlier — namely how people
                    regard making compromises. As I mentioned before, the two offices had
                    dramatically different orientations and, if you will, “cultures”. My staff saw
                    themselves as purely providers of fact and analysis, as “clean”, as opposed to
                    promoters or advocates for a particular position. They saw themselves as simply
                    “telling it like it is”. Meanwhile, those who were in the business of promoting
                    democracy had little or no desire to edit reports or be analytical drafters.
                    They wanted to go out and save the world for democracy and human rights, with a
                    greater emphasis on the former than the latter. With my staff the emphasis was
                    the opposite. To reiterate, there were these differing attitudes, with one set
                    of “promoters” not keen on the seeming drudgery of editing versus the “writers”
                    who did not want to be seen as “flag wavers”, especially in that particular
                    environment. At the time I had offered to extend, I was told that I could help
                    bring the merger into being. Initially, I assumed that I would basically
                    continue on in the job for which I had originally been hired; instead , I wound
                    up being one of three office directors handling a geographical element of this
                    newly merged (and then divided) office. So for the last few months of my
                    original tour and my extension year, the focus of my job shifted. Although I
                    technically supervised my staff's work on the human rights report, I now had a
                    new responsibility to bring to fruition this merger, and there was a lot of
                    gnashing of teeth and staff stress regarding what this would mean in both the
                    previous offices. People were concerned as to whether there would be favoritism
                    for one group versus the other and whether those who had never previously had to
                    draft or edit papers would not be willing to do so, etc. We had countless
                    meetings and discussions. We even brought in outside facilitators to try to
                    unify our ranks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Facilitators are sort of counselors.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0195" n="Page0195"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: That is right. There was a gentleman who recently died, Max Sedaris, who
                    normally worked with civil service personnel as a counselor, but he led a
                    workshop for us on team building. Frankly, I think I spent much of my time that
                    last year focusing on morale building or team building among people who were
                    suddenly thrust together. To further complicate the situation, we were not only
                    merging the old CRA, which handled country reports and asylum issues, with the
                    office that promoted human rights and democracy, called PHD, but after bring
                    them together we divided the new office into thirds along not completely obvious
                    geographical lines. In other words, I wound up with an office that covered Latin
                    America, or rather the Western Hemisphere, and East Asia. Another office covered
                    Europe and Africa, while the third dealt with South Asia and the Middle East.
                    Our leadership essentially divided the world in blocs. In some ways, Latin
                    America and Asia worked well together. We not only shared the Pacific Ocean but
                    had a number of cultural similarities, as well. Likewise, one could argue the
                    colonial linkages between Europe and Africa, and so on. Initially, however,
                    there was considerable confusion and a sense of artificial togetherness. I have
                    to say though that by the time I left my teams really worked together as a
                    cohesive unit, with staff working on Latin America showing some interest in
                    Asian developments and vice versus, with Asia hands even acknowledging that some
                    things could be learned from Latin Americans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that when you moved over and incorporated the
                        promotion of democracy, this was sort of a buzzword of this administration
                        and as with every administration when they get a buzzword going you have got
                        to show progress. Did you find this sort of pretty political?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0196" n="Page0196"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: Yes. Yet, I was lucky in not having to work on the Near East and South
                    Asia, which bore the brunt of the pressure to show progress. I think we all
                    learned two things from the merger experience. First, to make the merger real,
                    everyone had to do a little of everything. In other words, those who had
                    previously been in PHD had to edit some human rights reports, but not as many as
                    CRA officers previously had to do. In that regard, we were quite fortunate in
                    that we still could rely on the so-called “WAEs”, retirees who had handled a
                    substantial amount of the editing load in the old office and joined us in the
                    new. So everyone did wind up editing reports, but no one had to deal with scores
                    of them, as in the past; that was the good news. Much of our time that year was
                    spent on mastering the learning curve since it did take time for those who had
                    never done such reports to learn how to edit hem. Likewise, staff who had not
                    previously engaged in program development or been responsible for overseeing
                    democracy promotion programs had to learn the ropes, too. We were quite
                    fortunate during that period in that the demands on us were kept to a minimum.
                    We were not expected to work miracles overnight. Moreover, much of Latin
                    America, from the State Department's perspective, is considered to be democratic
                    and therefore requiring only limited amounts of democracy promotion activities.
                    Improvements were always welcome, and there were some, but there were fewer
                    mountains to climb in Latin America, leaving aside Cuba, as compared to Asia.
                    Cuba itself was a complicated situation because although human rights
                    improvements were always welcome, they were not the primary goal for the
                    Administration, which was more focused on more fundamental changes in the
                    regime.</p>
                <p>In Asia, considerable attention was paid to questions related to developments in
                    Thailand, where there had basically been a recent coup. Once again we ran into
                    competing demands of various USG agencies and groups regarding the extent to
                    which we would attend to conflicts in other smaller countries as opposed to
                    focusing primarily on Thailand. After all, there were also a number of “islands
                    in the sun” with major problems, not to mention China, which everyone was
                    interested in. As for China, there was always a great deal of “push-pull” on
                    that account. Yet, within our office, it could be said that those handling our
                    most problematic countries basically selected them themselves. For example, our
                    China person had been promoting human rights in China for a long time before the
                    merger, and continued to do so thereafter. What was disconcerting at times were
                    the mixed messages emanating from the administration itself. The Olympics was a
                    case in point. There was considerable discussion regarding whether we should
                    have had an Olympic strategy vis-a-vis China and human rights. Certainly the
                    notion had occurred to many, the goal promoted and the policy raised, but for
                    quite some time it was clearer what other nations or governments were doing than
                    what we ourselves were. As you can well imagine, there was a lot of butting of
                    heads between different segments within the USG on the appropriate approach on
                    this score. I mean, the question had been publicly raised as to whether the
                    president should attend the opening ceremonies or not. Should any actions be
                    taken? These were the types of questions that were brooded about and discussed
                    for months.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now there is tremendous conflict over the Chinese
                        repression in Tibet and the Olympic torch is being smothered by mobs in
                        London and Paris, etcetera, etcetera.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: That is right. We definitely concerned ourselves with this type of issue
                    or problem, of which there were many. More often than not, when we did see
                    improvements, they were minor or incremental at best. I recall talking to my
                    supervisor shortly before I was about to retire on the subject of whether we
                    really had anything to show for all our efforts. We were sort of musing on the
                    theme of progress, when he pointed out that we really weren't in the business of
                    creating miracles overnight. Diplomacy does take a heck of a long time, and
                    sometimes the best we can hope for is to prevent things from getting worse while
                    in other cases we do see incremental progress or at least we keep the issue
                    alive. However, it is easier to see the results of our efforts when there is a
                    coherent or cohesive administration positive, such as a fully agreed upon view
                    that Burma is engaging in human rights abuses. In such cases, circling the
                    wagons, speaking with one voice and even ratcheting up pressure within the
                    international community is much easier. Where the situation is more complicated
                    is in cases where we have competing interests within our own government with
                    regard to a particular part of the world. In the broader scheme of things, I
                    think, much of what we do as Foreign Service Officers is manage and “educate” up
                    our bosses — providing them with the reams of paper or briefings so that they
                    can go out and make our — office, bureau or agency — case vis-a vis their
                    counterparts. In the case of DRL, whenever my boss either had to speak about the
                    human rights reports or human rights conditions around the world, we produced
                    enormous quantities of paper to prep him. And this was the case in every bureau,
                    regional or functional, in which officers generated endless amounts of
                    information in the service of our superiors. How they used it might not always
                    have been the way one would have wished, but the material was there. I'd have to
                    say that on average for every Foreign Service Officer who reaches middle and
                    upper levels in the service, at least two-thirds of his time is spent in
                    servicing superiors, mentoring and team building with one's staff and
                    subordinates, and simply creating order in the ranks; if one is lucky, the
                    remaining third might be devoted to more substantive work, whether it be
                    producing a good report or promoting a program beneficial to one group or
                    another.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well also, implicit in that is that you are training a new
                        generation of officers coming up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: That is right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, an example and a direction to their outlook on

                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Yes, and frankly, for me that has been one of the more gratifying
                    aspects of the career, and one I was better at. I was less enthusiastic or
                    skilled in managing up.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0198" n="Page0198"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned your office dealt with asylum. Can you
                        explain what that was and what you all were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: That is a tricky one to explain at this juncture because the role of the
                    unit involved has also changed. But, in principle, though not always in fact and
                    for somewhat historical reasons, the State Department nominally had the last
                    word in asylum cases. What that meant was that INS, the former immigration
                    authority would send copies of all asylum request to the Department. Now, you
                    can image the sheer reams of paper involved; there was no way humanly possible
                    that our office could look at all that paper, and in fact, no one expected us
                    to. Rather, INS wanted another agency to have the official responsibility for
                    such decisions. In other words, the onus was on us. While the Department did
                    receive the documents in questions, what INS really expected us to review were
                    what we termed “judges' letters”. There were basically two levels in the
                    determination of asylum cases. First, there were routine cases, which would be
                    easily resolved by immigration officers. They would send us copies after a
                    decision — notably an approval — had been made. Cases that were more difficult
                    or unclear would be forwarded to an immigration judge who in turn would, in some
                    instances, request a State Department advisory. We would then review the case
                    and answer the mail. If we had nothing substantive to add, we could simply note
                    that fact in our response. In some instances, however, we did; that's when we
                    would make a real contribution. In our off months, when staff were not working
                    on the human rights reports, they would, in fact, be soliciting information from
                    our embassies and other sources regarding such asylum cases, specifically as to
                    whether or not a particular individual might have a well-founded fear of
                    persecution. After all, there were definitely instances in which a person had no
                    such well-founded fear. In addition to gather specific case information, we also
                    produced various papers, including country profiles and issue papers about
                    specific problems in a particular country.</p>
                <p>A country profile is basically an overview of key country conditions. These were
                    10-20 page research papers describing all the major human rights concerns and
                    issues in the country. Say for example, we are looking at Indonesia and you are
                    a Christian in Indonesia. How would you be treated; would you be oppressed or
                    not? Alternately, you could take a very specific slice of a country profile and
                    produce an issue paper — usually two or three pages that could be sent to the
                    immigration judge focusing on the treatment of Christians in Indonesia. Thus,
                    when the judge is reviewing a particular case relating to a Christian in
                    Indonesia, a paper of this type might be helpful to him in making his
                    determination. We ran across many genuine problem cases. On the other hand we
                    also received cases that were clearly fraudulent. In those instances, we could
                    go back to the judge and say, for example, that Russians were not routinely
                    persecuted in Belarus or whatever.</p>
                <pb facs="0199" n="Page0199"/>
                <p>However, during the last few years, there was a move afoot to stem the tide of
                    all this paper and to try to persuade our immigration colleagues that it served
                    no one's interest to keep sending all the papers over to State. That said, in my
                    last year, after the actual merger, the asylum segment was removed from my
                    former office and a new, small section was created, theoretically, to deal with
                    asylum. Nevertheless, the situation remained muddy because this new unit did not
                    have sufficient staff and was forced to look to the new regional offices for
                    help. So, the “la plus ca change” scenario held true here. In other words,
                    notwithstanding the major reconfiguration of the bureau, some of the same people
                    were working on the same types of cases.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I entered the retirement course in September, and officially retired in
                    November 2007.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Two questions I have. First, let me, one more immediate-
                        What was your- the- we are reaching the end of the Bush II administration,
                        he leaves in 2009 but this has been a controversial administration and
                        foreign affairs has been way at the top. How did you personally find dealing
                        with it in matters- did it cause difficulties for you sort of personally in
                        your work or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0200" n="Page0200"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: I think to a certain extent it did, more so back in the Department than
                    in my overseas assignments. In my last posting in the Caribbean there was
                    considerable good will toward the United States after 9/11. Initially, as I may
                    have mentioned , there was an incredible outpouring of support that lasted for
                    many months. In a way it was something of a reprieve because while much of the
                    world was somewhat puzzled by our election of President George W. Bush, after
                    9/11 you could say we were granted a form of dispensation, and most people were
                    willing to be supportive. Unfortunately, much of that goodwill gradually
                    dissipated. Back here, however, there was something that I had not seen in a
                    long time, namely a type of “true believer” mentality. As Foreign Service
                    officers, we are professionals and serve whomever is in power, and we try to do
                    the best job we can along the way. Yet, in this particular administration one
                    was very much regarded as being with or against the regime or whether or not you
                    were an adherent of the true faith, whatever that might be. I recall when the
                    last DRL Assistant Secretary came on board. I called on him to express my
                    enthusiasm for working with him and to convey my interest in staying on in my
                    job for an additional year. His immediate response was “why”. I answered
                    something to the effect that I really believed in the human rights work we were
                    doing. I also acknowledged that at times we had to be practical or pragmatic but
                    that I was truly committed to the work. He basically made clear to me that
                    pragmatism went out the window in 2001, and we all had to be essentially “true
                    believers” now. So, definitely, there was a certain righteousness prevalent in
                    my last few years at State that grew increasingly distasteful to me and
                    contributed to my decision to retire. I did not have to leave since I had not
                    run up against the proverbial State Department clock. I just felt that promoting
                    the policy of the day was not something I wanted to continue doing at that
                    point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel sort of disillusioned with the human rights
                        aspect of things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Certainly. While it is a good question, one can also question just how
                    high a priority human rights had been previously. Whenever one comes into a new
                    bureau, one that one has not worked in before, it is not always clear what the
                    attitudes were five or 10 years earlier. Obviously, there had been other
                    administrations that had to some degree or other been defenders of human rights.
                    To give this particular administration its due there were instances in which
                    there was a convergence of various interest and considerable attention was paid
                    to human rights cases and the promotion of democracy. For example, Burma was a
                    country where our leadership actively sought to promote improvements in human
                    rights and democracy. Of course, cynics could say that Burma fell into the “bad
                    country” category, where it was relatively easy to support just causes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well it is an easy-</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0201" n="Page0201"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: It is an easy target. So I do not want to say that this particular group
                    was any better or any worse than others. Perhaps the difference was in the
                    degree of hype or in the more recent vernacular “spin”. In other words, if you
                    insist on “talking the talk”, you should be willing to “walk the walk”. There
                    was definitely a great deal of talk about democracy and human rights, which made
                    the rather sordid exposes of USG abuses at Abu Ghraib and elsewhere all the more
                    distasteful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Another question just on this, I obviously do not want to
                        get into details, but was the CIA a contributor? I am talking about
                        information coming out of Langley to your reports.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Not really. What most people do not realize is that the human rights
                    reports are based exclusively on unclassified information. Or rather, the final
                    product is an unclassified report, available to all. So we neither looked to the
                    CIA for information, nor did they volunteer it. One caveat to this was not
                    directly related to the contents of the draft report but rather to information
                    provided to us from NGO sources or from the media. In rare instances, we might
                    report on an incident — real or alleged — and a colleague within State might
                    indicate there may be more to a particular story than meets the eye or involve
                    some other agency, and we should, perhaps, tread lightly. But that was about
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. What was your impression of the non-governmental
                        organizations that sort of keep watch of human rights, Amnesty
                        International, of course, is a major one; you mentioned Human Rights Watch.
                        What was your impression of their concerns; were they over the top, were
                        they pragmatic, true believers; what?</hi>

                <p>TONGOUR: Let me give you a very concrete example related to Colombia. To address
                    some concerns of the NGO community, my boss, the DRL Principle Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary (PDAS) and his counterpart in the bureau for Latin America (WHA) met
                    monthly with a group of NGO representatives focusing on the region. Each month,
                    the NGOs would provide us with a virtual laundry list of concerns related to
                    disappearances, killings and abuses, and each month we would take on board their
                    concerns and try to address them by providing additional information, trying to
                    ascertain what the Colombia government was doing about particular cases and
                    pressing it to do more. These sessions were not always pleasant . Although most
                    of the NGO representatives were highly professional and polite, there were
                    always a few that would make gratuitous jabs or be testy in their comments. Yet,
                    these get-togethers were important for us — keeping us honest and accountable.
                    If we said we would look into a case, we did. They were good at keeping our feet
                    to the fire and in that they served us very well. I would also go so far as to
                    say that at least 75 or 80 percent of their work is truly valuable. Like every
                    group or individual, they have their blind spots or one track minds and in some
                    instances might push in areas where their recommended actions might not be fully
                    warranted. That said, I think both Human Rights Watch and Amnesty were careful
                    in presenting their findings, and for the most part, the work they do is quite
                    admirable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Well sort of a big question; just looking at your
                        career and we are still I think sort of a revolution is almost over now as
                        far as women in the Foreign Service but you were doing- there during the
                        revolution when women were being brought in, what are your impressions of
                        what happened to you and how things have changed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: I think the fact that this is a non issue in most respects now is
                    probably the biggest change of all. Historically in most professions there has
                    always been the exceptional, brilliant woman who was able to get into the field
                    and get ahead. We all know about the women prime ministers and the occasional
                    assistant secretary — or more recently actual secretaries — at State. What
                    matters more, I think, is when an organization reaches the point of allowing
                    women to be as “mediocre” or middling as their average male counterpart. That in
                    a sense is when you have real progress. That fact that today at State there are
                    women at all levels and of all calibers — just as there are men — is a real sign
                    of change. I think on the whole the progress, while slow in coming, has been
                    real, and given the starting point, impressive..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, for you, did you feel that when you came in things
                        were of one state and that things were changing as you moved up the career
                        ladder?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0203" n="Page0203"/>
                <p>TONGOUR: Absolutely. And I think that the State Department deserves to be
                    commended on that score — whether it did so voluntarily or was pulled into
                    changing is irrelevant at this juncture because in terms of women, minorities
                    and the disabled major strides have been made. I know we've talked about how it
                    used to be — before I entered the service — when women officers had to leave if
                    they got married. Even beyond that, for quite some time there were other more
                    subtle forms of discrimination with regard to career development, specifically
                    in terms of “conal designation”. I happened to have been one of the so-called
                    “fortunate” ones in having started out as a “political cone” officer, but that
                    was rare then. When I entered, there was a four cone system, which has evolved
                    substantially over time. Then, entering officers were simply assigned a cone,
                    and traditionally women were assigned to the consular or possibly the
                    administrative cone. It was much more unusual for a woman to be assigned to the
                    political cone, because that was the cone for future ambassadors or those
                    expected to rise quickly within the system. In those days, people actually
                    referred to political and economic as the substantive cones. So one of the
                    biggest changes over the years — and linked to some extent to a class action law
                    suit — is the distribution of women more evenly among all the cones. And women
                    from various cones have in recent years risen to become ambassadors, deputy
                    assistant secretaries, assistant secretaries and so on.</p>
                <p>Now that said, the Foreign Service remains a tricky career on the personal front,
                    in ways that has little to do with the official system but rather with the
                    lifestyle choices of its members. Very recently a high ranking Foreign Service
                    officer and a former ambassador publicly berated the Department for its policy
                    on domestic partners. He himself was openly gay, and a major factor in his
                    decision to retire when he did was the Department's unwillingness to make
                    accommodations for his domestic male partner. For women, especially for women
                    with children, or for women officers with spouses or male officers married to
                    professional women — the career comes with a number of specific problems
                    associated with uprooting families every few years and transporting them to
                    various parts of the world. While the State Department has done a fairly good
                    job in minimizing the attendant disruptions, the problems are partly inherent in
                    the profession itself as well as tied to conditions in other parts of the world.
                    In other words, it is still a wonderful profession for a man who brings with him
                    a wife, who may well be accomplished and capable in her own right but is not
                    burning to have her own career. I recognize that this scenario may come with
                    other problems, but and everyone faces certain difficulties in adjustment.
                    Nevertheless, the configuration of officer, spouse and a couple of kids still
                    may be the optimum configuration for the type of life we live in the service.
                    How to make the system more user friendly for other types of individuals and
                    families and those seeking to balance the tradeoff between personal and
                    professional development is still one of the toughest nuts to crack in our
                    profession.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that is getting more and more difficult-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Possibly so.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you plan to do with the rest of your life?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Well, , interestingly enough, I recently began a temporary assignment
                    with the Board of Examiners, the office that admits individuals into the Foreign
                    Service and would like to do some other TDY work in the future. I also teach
                    literacy to English as a Second Language (ESL) students, take classes for my own
                    pleasure, and look forward to doing more traveling and volunteer work in the
                    future. Perhaps I'll consider a “third career” in a travel related field.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TONGOUR: Yes. I've enjoyed it so far and look forward to the adventures
                    ahead.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think we will stop at this point.</hi>
