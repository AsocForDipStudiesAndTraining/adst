                <p>Interviewed by: Lester Elliot Sadlow </p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an interview with retired Consul General William
                        D. Morgan by the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training [ADST] for
                        the Foreign Affairs Oral History Program. The date is June 23, 1995. I am
                        Lester Elliot Sadlow. Bill, we had an interview with you in 1988 which
                        covered mostly your experience in consular affairs and your later
                        assignments. What did your consular assignments begin with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Beirut was the first sizable consular assignment. That was five years
                    (1968-73), followed by overseas assignments in Paris (1978-81) and Montreal
                    (1981-85), where I served as Consul General as well as Principal Officer in the
                    latter. I had assignments in the Department in the Visa Office (1976-8) and as a
                    Foreign Service Inspector (1975-6). I returned from Beirut to spend a year as
                    chairman of the Consular Panel in the Board of Examiners of the Foreign Service
                    (BEX) and the next year in Senior Training at Ft. McNair in the Industrial
                    College of the Armed Forces (ICAF). I think that in the previous interview we
                    covered all of these assignments because they were largely consular related.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So in this interview we want to cover your entry into the
                        Foreign Service prior to your assignment to Beirut in 1968. We will also go
                        into your background. OK?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you talk a little about where you were born and grew
                        up and your educational background, leading up to your service in the U. S.
                        Army.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>MORGAN: I was born on November 10, 1925, and brought up in Rochester, New York. I
                    guess that I had the usual life for that period—grammar school, high school, and
                    then a thing called World War II came along. Before that, I think that it might
                    be worth mentioning, for those who might not have experienced it, that we had a
                    very serious economic depression in the United States in the 1930's. I remember
                    living a good 15 years of my life, taking it for granted that I couldn't have
                    certain things, because my father didn't have a job. I say that, just to throw a
                    little real-life background into at this point.. I think that for those of us
                    who lived through it the Great Depression became part of our upbringing—our
                    history. I have often compared notes with others of my age group and have found
                    that they all had similar experiences. It was a very unique and humbling
                    experience and lasted for me into World War II, when I went into the U. S. Army.
                    Basically, during the war everybody was all very much “gung ho” [to achieve
                    victory]. I graduated from high school in 1943. It was expected, and I expected
                    it of myself, that I would go into the military. It was a wonderful and
                    uplifting feeling. Maybe it was naive, but I didn't think so. I didn't wait to
                    be drafted.</p>
                <p>I volunteered at 17, to go into the Army, into a program that was then very
                    popular, called the Army Specialized Training Program [ASTP]. I went to Cornell
                    University to study engineering. I was at Cornell for three months and the Army
                    closed down the ASTP I was assigned to. For all practical purposes, in my view,
                    the Army needed more cannon fodder. Incidentally, I had just turned 18, and
                    became a real Army private.</p>
                <p>I was sent off to basic training at Ft. Benning, Georgia, and then was assigned
                    to the 87th Infantry Division stationed in Ft. Jackson S.C., which had served
                    very briefly during World War I and was then deactivated. It was reactivated for
                    World War II. It had a lot of southern officers and southern cadre, plus a lot
                    of northern boys as infantrymen. We Yankees joined the division at Ft. Jackson,
                    South Carolina. Here we were, welcomed by all of these White Rebels. Of course,
                    racial integration of whites and blacks hadn't been thought of as yet, and this
                    was quite an experience to be in the deep South at age 18. This was my first
                    real encounter with black people—in the countryside, not in my immediate
                    military ranks.. I don't think that I had ever seen a black person in my life,
                    as I came from upstate New York. We went through further training at Jackson and
                    then went into combat with the 87th.</p>
                <p>But first we sailed to England to wait transfer to France and into the combat
                    area. In November, 1944, we landed at Le Havre in Normandy, which had, of
                    course, been secured by then. We crossed France in trucks and troop-trains (40
                    and 8s from World War I) and on, to Eastern France. The 87th entered combat in
                    Metz. The Germans were still holding on to a fortress there. Let me pause there
                    and see whether you want to steer me in a different direction. Otherwise, I'll
                    be telling you war stories.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, tell us one of them.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>MORGAN: Well, I just discovered a couple of months ago a 40-page document that I
                    wrote at the end of the war. I didn't remember that I had written it. I now
                    teach Language Arts (English composition) to fourth grade students as a
                    volunteer. I was looking for some souvenirs from World War II for some
                    show-and-tell and came across the text.. I had been giving these kids background
                    on World War II as part of the 50th anniversary of VE-Day. Talk about history,
                    this was real-life history. That recaptured my days in combat in the 87th
                    Infantry Division. My class used the paper as their “source material”. I
                    wouldn't be able to answer your question as accurately if it weren't for that
                    “refresher”.</p>
                <p>". . . one good story” is one night when were in combat, heavy combat. To set the
                    scene, the period I'm talking about was from late November, 1944, until New
                    Year's Day, 1945, when I was wounded. We were on the Siegfried Line between
                    France and Germany near the Luxembourg border and in the Battle of the Bulge. I
                    rejoined the division, which was then at the Koblenz River. We crossed that,
                    then the Rhine River, and went on to Czechoslovakia, where we were located when
                    the war ended.</p>
                <p>The actual fighting in late November 1944, was the hardest days of the war. I was
                    then a radio operator in Company B and only about the fourth or fifth day into
                    combat. We were fighting face to face with Germans. We lost about one-third of
                    our Company killed and wounded, maybe more. It was the first time that I ever
                    witnessed that kind of death.</p>
                <p>We were in our shallow fresh-dug slit-trenches, our foxholes, in a little forest
                    called “Peanut Woods.” Most of us had fallen asleep from exhaustion. We were
                    supposed to take turns at guard duty, but I think that most of us were asleep. A
                    special detachment of German SS troops, or whatever they were, came through our
                    area. They were really good troops. They fired about two feet above the ground
                    to make us feel more secure below the fire-line, while others attacked with
                    bayonets. This was a clever tactic. We hunkered down in our foxholes, thinking
                    we were safe below the level of bullets. Many were bayoneted by the attacking
                    Germans. But that's enough of World War II. Let's get on to “life in the Foreign
                    Service”.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was your wartime experience your first time abroad?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes, other than in Canada. Rochester, NY, is on the border with
                    Canada.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you returned to the U. S. in 1945?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>MORGAN: I returned in July, 1945. Ours was the very first division to arrive home
                    after the end of the war. We came home on the USS United States,, which had been
                    outfitted as a new ship to serve as a troop ship. When we arrived in New York
                    harbor—in sight of the Statue of Liberty—the commanding general of the division
                    ordered us all down below. Somehow, his idea of what to do was to get the troops
                    off the deck. That was the first and only time we didn't obey orders. I couldn't
                    imagine how you could arrive in New York harbor, with the fireboats sending up
                    streams of water to welcome us—and here we were ordered to go below. I have been
                    a “revolting” person at various times during my career, and that was one of
                    them. We weren't about to go below as we came home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After you returned to the U. S., when did you first become
                        interested in the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Well, not for a good four or five years. First, I went to the University
                    of Rochester to get my bachelor's degree. I got home one week in January 1945,
                    and during the following week I started in at the university. At first I lived
                    at home but later moved into a fraternity house for the rest of the four years.
                    I majored in French literature and graduated in 1949. I thought that I was going
                    to teach French. I don't think that I even knew how to spell the words, “Foreign
                    Service.” I certainly had no connection with it.</p>
                <p>Then, fortunately, I began to learn some of the drawbacks to teaching. It wasn't
                    that I was avoiding it, but I began to think, “Do I really want to be a
                    teacher?” At about that time I visited Washington, DC, to see an old Army
                    friend. His sister worked at the State Department, and she took me over to meet
                    her boss. That's the real answer to your question as to how I first became
                    interested in the Foreign Service. It was through this woman and her boss. I
                    told him that I was going to get married as soon as I graduated and that then my
                    wife and I were going to Paris. I wanted to get my master's degree at the
                    Sorbonne—which I did. This man said, “Look, when you come back, come and see
                    us.”</p>
                <p>My wife and I returned (1950) after a year in Paris. She had gotten a job working
                    for the ECA (Economic Cooperation Administration), the body set up to administer
                    the Marshall Plan. She worked in the Hotel Talleyrand. Many years later (1978) I
                    worked in that same building as Consul General. I had a couple of job offers as
                    a teacher. I didn't think that they looked that good. One of the colleges that
                    offered me a teaching job was Ripon College. I didn't even know where the
                    college was. I certainly didn't think that I would be any good at teaching
                    basketball, Spanish, and Latin. So my wife said, “Why don't you go and see your
                    'friend' at the State Department?” So I did. He offered me a job at the State
                    Department's New York Reception Center. I said, “Does this mean that I'll be
                    going overseas?” We hadn't been back that long, and this was not something that
                    I had thought that much about. He said, “No, this is a Civil Service job. Play
                    it any way you want.”</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>So that got me to the New York Reception Center. The Wriston Program came along,
                    and I took the examination for the Foreign Service. But this was after three or
                    four years at the New York Reception Center.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you explain the Wriston Program a little bit
                        more?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: I can't remember who Wriston was. I think he was the president of a
                    university somewhere. He was commissioned, as I remember it, to do a study of
                    the growing needs of the State Department. There were questions about the
                    overseas operations of the Marshall Plan and where America's resources were
                    needed and the role the U.S. should play in the world in its overseas programs.
                    America had won a war but faced a new enemy. There were many things that our
                    nation wanted and needed to do in various areas.</p>
                <p>For example, the visa function, now involved refugees; alien influx was growing,
                    and American presence overseas was growing. But we didn't have the resources to
                    respond. First, we had had a very small Foreign Service before World War II.
                    Secondly, World War II produced a reduction in the Service through the demand
                    for military service alone. Most important of all, as I remember for the Wriston
                    Commission, was the question of whether we needed and wanted the same kind of
                    Foreign Service we had had. That is, did we want a service composed mainly of
                    “elitist, Yale-oriented, Ivy League” type of people from East Coast families
                    with money or did we want a service with a broader background? As I remember it,
                    those were some of the considerations behind the recommendations that came to be
                    called the Wriston Program.</p>
                <p>Finally, the real answer to your question is, “Hey, we already have the people
                    around that are already equipped. These are people who are in the Civil Service
                    or who are just entering the State Department.” In other words, people like me.
                    The final Wriston recommendations were duly adopted by the State Department. I
                    was told, for example, that I “had” to join the Foreign Service. Given my
                    background and my record, I had demonstrated that I was at least somewhat
                    equipped for the Foreign Service up to this point. The procedure under the
                    Wriston Program simply involved an examination of my credentials and an oral
                    interview. Applicants for Wristonization were not required to take a written
                    examination. I was told, “Look, you can take the Foreign Service exam if you
                    want to, but the examiners are coming to New York next week.” After the
                    examiners considered me, I was informed that I was in the Foreign Service. Well,
                    anyway, I took the exam, which took three days, more or less as a lark. I think
                    that I passed it, though not with particularly high marks. I think my grade was
                    in the 70's, which was another way of saying, “OK, you passed.”</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>My wife and I talked about it and thought, “Well, what do we have as a career
                    future?” We were in our 20's. By then we had two children, born during our five
                    years in New York. Obviously, we did have family considerations, but we decided
                    to give the Foreign Service: a chance. There was also a feeling about the
                    Foreign Service: it had “snobs” and was an “elitist” kind of organization,
                    although I don't think that I had any lack of self-confidence. I wondered
                    whether I could really compete with this “elitist” group in the Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <p>The more I considered it, those people who came into the Foreign Service through
                    the Wriston Program, as well as the “general intake” of people through the
                    examination system, came from a much broader range of backgrounds than had
                    previously been the case. There were a lot of opportunities facing us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After your acceptance in the Foreign Service what happened
                        to you immediately?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: You won't believe it. I got a call from Washington. I was told that I was
                    being assigned to Paris. My wife went through the ceiling. She said, “We're
                    joining the Foreign Service, aren't we? We just came from Paris. You're a French
                    major. They're not going to assign you to Paris.” Well, I said, I had been fully
                    accepted into the Foreign Service, and that was it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about that assignment to Paris, since you
                        had just returned from Paris?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>MORGAN: I more or less felt the same way that my wife did. I thought that I would
                    rather go to Africa, Tokyo, or some place else. My wife and I arrived in Paris
                    as a just-married student couple. At the end of our first month there in 1949,
                    we didn't have a penny in our pockets. We had just cashed our last Travelers
                    Cheque for $10. She had no job. So we lived a student's life. You know, France
                    was wonderful in 1949 and 1950. The French were not what they are today. They
                    were really defeated. The country was in a state of chaos. They had lost a war,
                    not only psychologically, but physically as well. But the Marshall Plan was
                    operational and my wife got a job working for it — the ECA (Economic Community
                    Assistance?). She made $2,500 a year, and that took us very nicely through the
                    rest of that year and paid our way home. I think that we came out a couple of
                    hundred dollars ahead and managed to travel all over Europe. I don't mean to say
                    that hamburgers cost five cents, but things were easier to do then on such an
                    income. My assignment as an FSO to Paris 1956, was a matter of going back to
                    that world, in part. However, in those few years Paris had changed considerably.
                    The country was certainly on its way up. It had benefitted a great deal from the
                    Marshall Plan. My assignment was as Staff Aide to the Ambassador to USRO (United
                    States delegation to Regional Organizations). These were NATO [North Atlantic
                    Treaty Organization], OECD [Organization for Economic Cooperation and
                    Development], and COCOM [Coordinating Committee of trade with Communist
                    countries]. We had a number of ambassadors assigned to Paris in one capacity or
                    another at the time. I think that there were seven of them in Paris at the time,
                    including our Ambassador to France, of course.</p>
                <p>Not far from where the American Embassy on the Place de la Concorde, is, was, and
                    hopefully always will be, the Hotel Talleyrand. It is called a hotel — in
                    French, a private home for the rich — and was built at the end of the 18th
                    century. It was named for Talleyrand, a subsequent owner who was then French
                    Foreign Minister. It is a magnificent place. Ironically, my wife had worked on
                    top floor for ECA in 1949-50. I was assigned there in 1956-8 to USRO, during my
                    very first tour of duty in the Foreign Service. It was headed by Ambassador
                    Burgess, a former Secretary of the Treasury. NATO Headquarters were in Paris
                    then [1956], at the Palais de Chaillot, in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower. That
                    is where all of the NATO meetings took place. I was the official liaison officer
                    with the Secretariat of NATO. I only focused on the NATO part. There was another
                    officer who handled [liaison] duties similar to mine with OECD. We had little to
                    do with COCOM, a term you may never have heard of. Until very recently COCOM
                    controlled trade with communist countries. But you were particularly concerned
                    with our relations with NATO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, let's talk about that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>MORGAN: The job I had was Staff Aide to Ambassador Burgess. As a lot of people
                    know, whatever the Ambassador wants [his staff aide] to do, I did. More
                    specifically, I more or less “managed his desk,” made sure that the right
                    telegrams got there, and ensured that they were acted on. I did that sort of
                    typical, secretarial work. I also had a job of liaison with the NATO
                    secretariat, which kept me very close to the Secretary General and Executive
                    Director of NATO, concerning meetings, agendas, and that sort of thing. I would
                    then report back to the State Department. We had an office back in the Bureau of
                    European Affairs in Washington which followed NATO affairs, OECD, and so on for
                    USRO. This office gave us our instructions. The [NATO] agenda items covered an
                    enormous range of subjects. They were military and political and often were very
                    complex.</p>
                <p>It was not at all unusual for the weekly meeting of the NAC, or North Atlantic
                    Council, which was attended by the ambassadors of each member state of NATO, to
                    cover 15 or 20 agenda items. Some of these were minor issues,, but others were
                    of great consequence in our emerging military and political struggle with the
                    U.S.S.R. Obviously, NATO was formed as a military organization, the North
                    Atlantic Alliance, to combat the threat as perceived from the growing Eastern
                    European and Soviet military forces.. The military aspect of the alliance was
                    the first and foremost consideration. Anyhow, agenda issues, for example, were
                    the common standards of the caliber of the guns and the inter-operability” of
                    weapons systems. NATO had a large, military staff. Our own Delegation was like
                    an Embassy. It had Political, Economic, Administrative, and Military Sections.
                    The Military Section was particularly large. Military matters usually accounted
                    for a good part of the agenda at meetings of the NAC. Remember, of course, that
                    the heart of the military element of NATO was SHAPE (Supreme Headquarters Armed
                    Forces Europe). NATO was the political, government-to-government base to whom
                    the different Armed Forces ultimately reported.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the size and composition of the USRO staff in
                        terms of numbers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: The State Department element of USRO amounted to 40 or 50 employees. Our
                    files were enormous, because we had NATO documents classified COSMIC, TOP
                    SECRET, and lower, as well as our own U.S. similarly classified. Remember we
                    were government bureaucracies. We had rooms filled with documents like that. As
                    an anecdote of the things I did,, once I left two of these rooms open during a
                    weekend when I'd been called in by the Ambassador when the Soviets invaded
                    Hungary. I got a nice fist-full of “pink slips” [security violation reports]
                    showing violations for that.</p>
                <p>The Military Section probably had about 30 people. We also had representatives
                    from the Treasury Department. Our OECD responsibilities were handled separately.
                    However, we had economic issues with NATO. I even sat on the International Staff
                    (of NATO) Budget Committee. There were a lot of financial issues that were dealt
                    with by our Economic Section.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>Remember, those were the days when NATO was mainly a security entity protecting
                    Europe and North Americas. The United Nations had begun a few years earlier but
                    really, in my mind, hadn't defined itself practically and certainly had to
                    separate itself from military alliances, although the UN Charter authorized
                    them.. It hadn't gotten into some of the issues in which it is involved today.
                    NATO was the major “power” organization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the internal situation in our Delegation to
                        NATO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Well, there are always personality and policy conflicts in any large
                    organization. However, I must say that most people that I dealt with—that is to
                    say, within the USRO Political and Administrative Sections—were very reasonable.
                    They had a job to do. You really didn't think in terms of personality
                    differences complicating what we were doing—fighting over “turf” and things like
                    that. We had more than enough to do. We were there every night until 6:00, 7:00,
                    or 8:00 PM, and often on weekends, constantly taking on the next issue. Bob
                    Miller, for example, was a junior officer colleague in the Political Section. We
                    remain good friends to this day. There was also John Stutesman. These people
                    were all good friends.</p>
                <p>The only issue which comes to mind where there were differences brings a smile to
                    my face. This involved the military. I think that it was hard for our military
                    to handle an assignment to what amounts to a diplomatic mission. I think that
                    some of the colonels assigned to USRO tended to think that it was still World
                    War II and that we were about to attack the Soviets, who, in many ways, were the
                    new Nazi enemy. . Therefore, they had trouble appreciating some of the
                    evolving—what shall we call them?—different approaches to issues which were
                    emerging with the changes taking place in the Soviet Union. Stalin was no longer
                    around, so it was no longer the “old” and as directly threatening militarily
                    Soviet Union. The Soviets were scientifically becoming more significant and,
                    most serious of all, had near or perceived nuclear parity. Also, I don't think
                    that we had a person on that Delegation who really knew very much, first-hand,
                    about the Soviet Union, and I wasn't one of them...yet.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>Our military were also having a lot of bureaucratic trouble with these questions
                    when translated to turf. I remember one officer who asked me one day, “Bill, I
                    do not understand the difference between the State Department's ranks and the
                    military. Can you tell me whether I 'rank' that State guy or not? Now, I'm a
                    lieutenant colonel, and he is a second secretary. How would you compare the
                    two?” And I, being compulsively friendly — he was a fine colleague and friend —
                    but probably not giving him the answer he wanted, said: “Actually, colonel, they
                    are incomparable.” He looked at me, laughed, and said: “I know what you mean.”
                    It was an attempt really to compare two historically different “families,” if
                    you will. Of course, this was soon after the end of World War II, and I still
                    well remembered that I was a lowly enlisted man. It wasn't that long after a
                    really wonderful, military victory. The soldiers were heroes, and these officers
                    were heroes. The military were assigned to Paris in a diplomatic not military
                    setting and all of what goes with it. It was often a case of trying to fight
                    battles, if you will, when there wasn't any clear definition of the ground on
                    which they were fighting. They were facing an “enemy”, sometimes, who turned out
                    to be fellow Americans. State Department people can be “arrogant,” “difficult,”
                    taken with their own power or perceived authority at times. This could be
                    difficult for our military colleagues to understand or tolerate.</p>
                <p>I must say that most of the American military assigned to USRO were very skilled
                    and professional at doing their jobs, although there was this little competition
                    problem. Ambassador Burgess' rule, if there was any question about it, was to
                    get rid of incompetent staff as he made clear when they left. But that is the
                    only issue I can remember. I don't recall any other “personality: strains.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you recall any specific instances where the diplomats
                        opposed the military over a particular issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: The short answer is, “No.” The longer answer is that some things were
                    rather “technical.” For example, we had a discussion which probably continues to
                    this day on what kind and size of airplanes NATO should have. What tactics
                    should we have? Should Belgium or the UK do this, or that in using its air force
                    assets?. There were questions like that. An example of a non-military one
                    involved Iceland, which at the time had a communist government or, rather, a
                    coalition government in which the communists participated. Iceland was not
                    permitted to attend the meetings of the North Atlantic Council. Of course, they
                    received all of the documents. But I had to make sure that the Icelandic
                    Delegation received no documents from our Delegation that were classified above,
                    I think, LIMITED OFFICIAL USE, or something like that.</p>
                <p>That's not really an answer to your question about issues that divided the State
                    Department from the U. S. military. However, this is an example of some of the
                    realities affecting what we were doing in NATO in those days.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>I think that most of the “problem” issues involved the size of NATO forces, their
                    status in the various host countries, and how much we could or should share with
                    our allied, for example, in terms of our own military intelligence or classified
                    documents. In other words, to what extent were the NATO countries really our
                    allies and what U.S. laws limited our sharing of information? The French were
                    our allies but, if you remember, about that time they pulled out of the military
                    structure of NATO. They just said, “goodbye.” (or said goodbye to us!) This was
                    after I left, but not too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a matter of record, could you tell us who the members
                        of NATO were at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Gracious. There were 15 members. They included the United Kingdom,
                    France, Canada, West Germany, Portugal, Italy, Norway, Denmark, Iceland,
                    Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, Turkey and Greece Because the last two
                    were constantly squabbling over Cyprus, we were forever going to NAC meetings on
                    Saturday (at least I remembering it interrupting my weekends) over the Cyprus
                    conflict.</p>

                <p>MORGAN: In NATO? The organization as a whole?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and especially the U. S. Delegation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Within NATO as a whole, the Soviet Union was perceived as a threat to the
                    security of its members. That perception was part of an ongoing tension that
                    continued until the fall of the Soviet Union. But still one nation perceives
                    such tensions and threats differently. France, for example, looked at NATO as an
                    ideological, Anglo-controlled entity. Germany saw the Soviet threat as directly
                    on its border. Germany considered itself — most realistically — to be the
                    potential battlefield. And it was. That's where the Warsaw Pact troops were
                    amassed. That's where the battle lines were drawn. That's where the “trip wires”
                    were. Norway and Turkey bordered directly territorially on the Soviet Union.
                    Denmark and Greece bordered on the Soviet Union by water. Maybe that's the
                    answer to your question. Those closer to the Soviet threat felt it with greater
                    immediacy. Britain was always very sophisticated in its approach and was just
                    getting over losing its empire.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>Much of the answer to your question relates to the United States as the leading
                    world power. We had the money, we had the forces, we had the resources and the
                    will to face down the Soviets. Every one of the NATO countries, Canada included,
                    had its own bilateral issues with the United States. Some of these were and
                    perhaps always will be emotionally based:. Jealousy and envy. I've always
                    considered foreign policy to be driven by emotional considerations — often
                    cultural, and religious, and historical, but from the “heart and the gut”.
                    Britain, for example, was going through historic agonies at this time. There was
                    the Suez crisis in 1956, following Egyptian nationalization of the Suez Canal.
                    There was a perception in Britain that we were no longer their “friends,” if you
                    will, and could not be trusted as we were allies in World War II. Also, there
                    was that feeling, and so much of this is feeling, that the British were
                    dependent on us under the Marshall Plan, although they handled this matter very
                    admirably—and most of the British were able to accept this. There was this
                    feeling of “National pride,” and it continued to manifest itself in NATO.</p>
                <p>Now, we were together and were united in one particular cause: the defense of
                    Western Europe and the tradition of Western Culture. But that didn't mean that
                    other causes or questions were not out there at the same time. There was a
                    comparable feeling among the French, for example, it was called by the French
                    the “Coca Colonizing” of France. Namely, the U.S. was in France to overwhelm
                    French culture with American. In fact, we were — intentionally or not —
                    proceeding to do this very thing, by example and strength and influence of our
                    way of life.</p>
                <p>All of those things were issues. Whenever the Soviets “behaved themselves,” so to
                    speak, or at least didn't “bark out loud” in antagonistic attacks against us,
                    these issues would come up. On the other hand, when the Hungarian Revolt of 1956
                    occurred that really brought NATO together, just as failing marriages are often
                    brought back together by tragedy. That sort of thing focused the attention of
                    the NATO members. Otherwise, we bickered. We had to do an awful lot of bilateral
                    “fence mending.”</p>
                <p>Then there was something else I would like to interject here which, to me, was
                    very important. I remember about half way through my tour at USRO in Paris — and
                    that would have been about 1957—a fellow by the name of Joe Wolf arrived. He was
                    the new Political Counselor replacing Jack Tuthill. Joe was a very vigorous,
                    driving, overwhelming, arrogant, and all of those wonderful words: a powerful,
                    self-confident, intelligent FSO. He met with the Ambassador, of course, but
                    eventually he met with the more junior officers, including myself and others in
                    other parts of the Mission who were part of our Delegation to NATO. He made it
                    clear that he was there for one, simple reason. The State Department and the
                    President wanted a new definition for our NATO relationship. NATO had been
                    founded as a military, security/defense organization, to confront the military
                    threat posed by the Soviet Union. However, we had some internal differences, and
                    there were the realities of an evolving Europe, and an evolving Soviet Union to
                    consider. Now, when did Stalin die?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1953.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Right. So Stalin was already dead, but the Soviet Union still had not
                    become a more open, less threatening society under Malenkov and then under
                    Khrushchev. However, the Soviet threat was becoming more “political” and
                    “ideological,” if you will. And the Soviets, of course, were extremely good in
                    claiming bilaterally and in other relationships that they were just “one of the
                    boys”; “ Peace loving,” as was their favorite word. They suggested that now that
                    they had gotten rid of Stalin, things were much better and that the Soviet Union
                    was no longer a threat. All of this was going on. So Joe Wolf said that he had
                    come to USRO to present our new policy toward NATO. That is, in addition to
                    being a strong, military alliance, NATO was also a political force and that our
                    Delegation would take the lead and be part of expanding NATO's role as a
                    political body. That would, for example, involve culture, anti-KGB (Soviet
                    secret police) efforts such as using ballet performers as intelligence operators
                    — such efforts would be more complex, sophisticated penetration of NATO efforts
                    at resisting the communist thrusts at Western security and unity. The KGB was
                    proving itself to be much more clever, politically. In other words, they were
                    using forces as effective as arms and military threats. That was the
                    significance of Joe Wolf's arrival message.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean that Joe Wolf addressed such issues as
                        infiltration as a communist “soft” invasion?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes, but I would say that he was more particularly addressing the issue
                    of unity within NATO. He indicated that we should not “back away” from issues.
                    We should “face up to them.” Avoiding political discussion within NATO would be
                    dangerous. It would result in fulfilling Soviet ambitions to destroy NATO or at
                    least weaken it from within. This could be prevented only through “political”
                    unity or increased cooperation, understanding, and discussion. So then the
                    agenda for the NAC meetings became much more “political.” We didn't have an
                    “anti-KGB” section, but we did discuss what kind of relations we should have
                    with the Soviet Union, because most of the NATO countries had bilateral
                    relations with the Soviet Union. So there was an examination of some of the
                    things that the Soviets were doing and how we would react to them, how we could
                    counter them, what we anticipated from them, and how we could defend ourselves
                    as a group of countries. Really, NATO was the only practical, evolving, strong,
                    Western group which could ensure that the Soviet and communist threat would not
                    become a reality.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you give us some concrete examples of the threat as
                        perceived?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes. One of the best examples which sticks in my mind is the Soviet Army
                    Chorus. What a threat they were! [Laughter] They sang loud and they were
                    honorable members of the Red Army. But could we let them into our countries?
                    This kind of question went on for many years—an artistic expression, if you
                    will. Now, what other examples are there? The arts come first to mind, because
                    the Soviets are very good in such fields. In fact, when I returned to the U. S.
                    from Moscow—I'm jumping ahead a little bit—I was involved in negotiating
                    cultural exchanges, such as film, theater (”Hello Dolly”), and other efforts of
                    impresario Sol Hurok. This was about the only positive expression of the control
                    of cultural exchanges. “Ideology” is probably the word that best describes this
                    question]. There were issues involving the press, the concept of
                    “disinformation” information deliberately falsified to serve a political purpose
                    programs which the Soviets engaged in very successfully. The question was how
                    the NATO countries as a group could react to such developments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about our own efforts in the U. S. Delegation in
                        engaging in propaganda?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Well, we had an Information Office, headed by a PAO, or Public Affairs
                    Officer, with a staff, including press officers, and so on. I'm sure that they
                    were fine and did their work. However, maybe they engaged in the more
                    traditional, public affairs types of activities. They didn't engage in
                    “propaganda,” per se. It was largely a press office. They had no “cultural”
                    program at that time, except on a bilateral level in our embassy. But that was
                    only involved in activities in France. At the same time, how proper would it be
                    for us to be engaged in all of these things when we had an Embassy in each of
                    our NATO countries doing the same thing in a bilateral context? As I recall it,
                    I remember issuing press notices to counter something which had appeared [in the
                    media]. We would do something in consultation with our other information
                    people.</p>
                <p>NATO had an enormous and very effective information section. Our people would
                    work with them. I guess that the real answer to your question is that NATO, of
                    course, engaged in a lot of press activity, informing each country, in turn,
                    through its own government, what NATO was and why we belonged to the
                    organization. The question might be asked, why are we dumping all this money
                    down a rat hole? We really didn't have that problem, because it wasn't a rat
                    hole. “The enemy”, and its efforts were as clear as a bell. I don't remember
                    that money was a problem for public affairs activities information. .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel personally about the NATO presence in
                        Europe and how did you perceive the threat of the Warsaw Pact in real
                        terms?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>MORGAN: This was probably affected by my age. I was young, at the time. Secondly,
                    there was the fact of Soviet behavior. They were undoubtedly and measurably a
                    threat. This was easily documented by their very actions constantly and
                    consistently. The Soviet threat was also big—bigger than we thought, as we
                    discovered. So I never personally gave the matter a second thought. I was sure
                    that we were on the right track.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did anybody question it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: No. I don't think that anybody, to this day, has questioned it. One could
                    argue that it really wasn't so much of a threat, especially now that the USSR
                    and its allies have collapsed. I think that it actually was a threat at the
                    time, though perhaps not as great as we thought. Certainly, we were right to
                    evaluate their growing weaknesses, especially economic. In the late 1950s, when
                    I was in USRO, the Soviet threat brought our allies together, after a very
                    devastating war. It gave the United States a definably honorable role to play.
                    We had to be careful, however, about being the big, too strong partner—as we
                    were, and at times acted as if we were.</p>
                <p>However, there was so much contact with the NATO countries. American Congressmen
                    traveled all over these countries. NATO was—and is—an alliance. It provided
                    another, tangential prop or support to our world leadership role.. It helped us
                    to assist a lot of other countries—Greece and Turkey, for example, on the Cyprus
                    issue. Events in Iceland, Italy. Our activities in NATO gave strength to
                    countries building on a democratic base. We were all forced, all the time, to
                    remember that we were Western countries with a certain tradition which had just
                    gone through, in some cases, a devastating war. Look what World War II did to
                    Germany in that regard. NATO, OECD, and the Marshall Plan turned a severely
                    damaged country around. This provided a means, a setting for them to get their
                    stability, democratic institutions and honor back. It provided us a means to
                    restore the French. In a negative sense, NATO gave France an opportunity to be
                    French again—by kicking us all out! It permitted De Gaulle to be De Gaulle.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk about some of the other delegations to
                        NATO, your personal interaction with them, and your impressions of
                        them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Well, first and foremost is Great Britain. We tend to be looked at by
                    many as their allies, or at least a country very close to them. This is based on
                    a common language, background, and so forth. I think that I knew more of the
                    people in the British Delegation [than in any other]. I think that we had the
                    best relations with them, despite the Suez Crisis of 1956.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>In terms of France, I had no particular reactions to the French whatsoever. I had
                    virtually no contact with them at all. They were getting progressively more
                    difficult and separated from NATO, at least the military part. .</p>
                <p>Scandinavia. I went to high level NATO meetings attended by the presidents and
                    prime ministers of all the countries. There were meetings of this kind, I think,
                    twice a year—once where the Heads of Government came. President Eisenhower
                    represented the United States on one occasion. There were also regular meetings
                    of foreign ministers. One of the foreign ministers' meetings was held in
                    Copenhagen, which I had the great pleasure of attending. I had a great time. I
                    hadn't been to Copenhagen before. It happened that I had worked with the Danish
                    foreign minister, Per Hekkerup, who had come to New York as a grantee when I was
                    assigned there. He had come to the U. S. under a leader exchange grant. Imagine,
                    little me alone with the Foreign Minister, his wife and family, for the day at
                    their small unpretentious home outside the capital. I have a lot of nice
                    memories of dealing with the Norwegians and the Danes.</p>
                <p>However, it was different with the Icelanders. I remember one time calling the
                    Icelandic Delegation. They were considered to be “communists.” In that sense, I
                    was in a somewhat false position. I remember the Icelandic Ambassador saying,
                    “Oh, Mr. Morgan. It's good to hear you.” I said, “Well, you know, sir, I can't
                    call you or speak to you.” He said, “I don't speak to you, either. It's OK.” So
                    we went on. I had something important to tell him. He wasn't supposed to talk to
                    me, nor I to him, but we had to talk. I can't remember what the issue was.
                    However, there were those little memories of “impossible” situations solved by a
                    nice ambassador on the other end of the phone.</p>
                <p>The Italians. They were in a state of constant confusion. They were delightful
                    people, but you never could get anything out of them. I'd call and try to get
                    some information from the Italian Ambassador. I was never sure whether it was
                    going to be correct or if the position was going to be undone by somebody else
                    in the Delegation. I don't mean to be trivial about it. They were fine and
                    wonderful colleagues, but I remember never being certain if the little piece of
                    information that I had obtained from them would prove correct.</p>
                <p>Most of the others I dealt with on business. For example, I was responsible for
                    following all of the heads of government meetings—about security issues, passes,
                    follow-up documents and so forth. I can remember stopping at the entrance to the
                    Palais de Chaillot with President Eisenhower on one side of me and Secretary of
                    State Dulles on the other. We all had our identity badges hanging from our
                    lapels, except President Eisenhower. The guard stopped him. He said, “You have
                    to have a badge.” It was all very embarrassing to have the President of the
                    United States stopped. Finally, they turned to me and said, “Mr. Morgan, will
                    you authorize the President of the United States to come in?” I said, “Of course
                    I will.” The President seemed somewhat annoyed. There were little things like
                    that. I presume that you wanted me to make these remarks personal. Maybe they
                    are not up to the higher level of your question.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's extraordinary that the guard would not let the
                        President of the United States in. What did the President have to say about
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: He was furious with his staff aide because the staff aide had left the
                    pass back at the Ambassador's residence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go to some more “saucy” parts. You were in USRO from
                        1956 to 1958. The Warsaw Pact invaded Hungary in 1956. What happened inside
                        the U. S. Delegation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Well, it really was something. I received a phone call at home from the
                    Ambassador, asking me to come into the office. He told me what had happened.
                    There were just the two of us at the Delegation office for the rest of the day.
                    He called me at around 11:00 AM, and we left there at 7:00 PM that night. I
                    remember because the office was dark: that's how I got a security violation.
                    During the day it had been nice and bright in the secure rooms. I didn't have to
                    turn any lights on.</p>
                <p>I remember the Ambassador talking over the phone many times in the course of the
                    day to the Secretary General of NATO and to other ambassadors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Secretary General?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Lord Ismay, a retired British general. However, let's get everything in
                    its proper—my— perspective. I spent most of the day running back and forth to
                    the file room, finding telegrams and looking up various things. We didn't talk
                    to the State Department in Washington over the phone in those days the way we do
                    today. Well, a lot of this stuff could not be discussed over the phone. Clearly,
                    the Embassy communications people had been called in. Our USRO communications
                    were handled at the Embassy. I would run back and forth to the Embassy to pick
                    up telegrams and other communications and bring them back to our office. The
                    regular telegraphic “take” was obviously coming in.</p>
                <p>The substantive answer to your question of what the U. S. Delegation did in
                    response to the Hungarian invasion is that we went through a period of
                    incredible frustration on everybody's part. What could we do—what could NATO and
                    the United States do? A lot of the answers to such questions we discussed at
                    great length. What were the intentions of NATO and the United States? As I
                    remember it, we didn't get any answers. “We”, was of course telegraphically
                    between our embassies and the Department. But “we” were the Ambassador and I at
                    times. We were there alone a great deal of the time. “I” was a sounding board,
                    but it felt good.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>However, I think that it was near the end of that day. The Ambassador was almost
                    weeping in total frustration. We had the Political Counselor, Joe Wolf, in the
                    office, as well as our Deputy Chief of Mission, Frederick E. (”Fritz”) Nolting.
                    Other people drifted in and out of the office. I mostly remember the Ambassador
                    and me. He wondered what we could do. Obviously, he wasn't asking me for real
                    advice!.</p>
                <p>Let's go back to a much more important question. What was really happening? What
                    were the Soviets really doing? What were their intentions? What was the
                    Hungarian reaction? What was the Hungarian Government doing? What were the
                    forces involved? I remember calling in the senior military man in our Delegation
                    and getting what you might expect from him. He said, “Sir, I don't know. I can
                    tell you where our troops are. I can tell you where our forces are in Germany.”
                    And that sums it up and I don't blame him. He gave what he knew..</p>
                <p>I might be confusing my stories here, but it's not that important. I found out
                    very soon—I don't know whether it was that day or very shortly thereafter, maybe
                    the next day. The Ambassador said: “Well, the bottom line is, there is a country
                    between us in NATO and Hungary. It's called Austria. The real question is
                    whether we are prepared to invade Austria. Or, an equally serious question is,
                    what are the Austrians prepared to do about it?” I don't remember factually what
                    it was, but I seem to remember that the Austrians just said, “No.” If I remember
                    my history correctly, they were still waiting to implement the peace treaty of
                    1955, the four-power agreement on Austria's position. That treaty provided that
                    Austria was a neutral country and certainly not a member of NATO.</p>
                <p>So it was not a simple matter of invading Hungary. How could you get to help whom
                    and against whom?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember considering an option to move military
                        forces into Austria?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who would the players have been in that scenario?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>MORGAN: I don't remember it all, but obviously that was an option. However, when
                    you consider options like that, the decisions then are very clear—invasion. I
                    think that the real answer to your question is that this whole question was
                    resolved quickly. Or, somebody else might say, we “surrendered,” or the Soviets
                    “won,” or whatever. As I remember it, the event was over with. The young
                    Hungarians who climbed up on Soviet tanks were killed. I think that this
                    happened at the end of that first day. It was all over. Then it became almost
                    academic. You don't invade any place, any time. You don't invade under those
                    circumstances, unless a war is going on, unless you are there to help or support
                    a government or a very large force which had risen up in opposition to the
                    Soviets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There also must have been a lot of confusion during that
                        day, and then it ended before a major decision could have been taken.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes. You could use the word, “fortunately” in this connection.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: At the time I felt very frustrated. What the hell do we have NATO for if
                    we can't do something?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel when it ended?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Well, I don't exactly remember. I probably felt relieved. That is a
                    bureaucratic answer. I might have wondered how many more Sundays I would have to
                    come into the office. More seriously, as I reflect back, this was all very
                    disheartening. I didn't consider that it had been a “failure” of NATO. I think
                    that it became a reality. Did we want to go to war with the Soviet Union? That
                    was the bottom line question. Were the Soviets prepared? They were talking about
                    atomic bombs flying back and forth. That has always been behind most “hand
                    wringing” decisions over the past 35 or 40 years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember the reaction of the military people in our
                        Delegation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>MORGAN: No, I don't remember. I don't remember any strain after the fact or any
                    internal tensions. What were the odds? What were we dealing with? Also, there
                    was a definition. Brezhnev, with his Doctrine, hadn't come into power yet in the
                    Soviet Union. But there was a definition of what the sphere of influence of the
                    Soviet Union was. The Hungarian uprising happened in “their” sphere. If the
                    Soviets had come into Germany, it would have been very easy to answer the
                    question of what to do. Or if they had gone into Greece. But they went into a
                    country in “their” area. I hate to use the term, “sphere of influence.” I'm
                    certainly not going to blame Presidents Roosevelt and Truman or anyone else.
                    There was a general agreement that things that happened on “that” side of the
                    line were a Soviet responsibility.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, certainly, Hungary was a Warsaw Pact country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: All right—there's the real answer to your question. It's as accurate as
                    any other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Suez crisis of 1956?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: I arrived in Paris in June, 1956. If I was in Paris at the time, I don't
                    remember any direct involvement in this matter. I remember very well the years
                    involved to get the British and French...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If you arrived after the Suez incident, you must have
                        noticed the wedge that came between certain NATO countries.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Between us, on the one hand, and Britain and France on the other. I
                    certainly remember the British and the French squawking like crazy about the
                    “duplicitous” nature of the United States. They said that we couldn't be
                    trusted, that we were a horrible country, and so forth. I don't remember any
                    particular feeling within NATO. I went on to the United Kingdom for my next
                    tour. There, of course, the memory of U. S. behavior at the time of the Suez
                    Crisis lingered on. However, this usually came from the very conservative, older
                    people who still resented Britain's losing her Empire. But there was no such
                    feeling in NATO, that I recall. Maybe a few words here and there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you think of any other memorable experience during
                        your time at USRO? Then you also worked for a time under Ambassador Amory
                        Houghton?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>MORGAN: The most memorable thing was that my wife and I found ourselves once more
                    in Paris. This time we had two children. Our son was just a couple of months
                    old, but our daughter went to kindergarten and first grade in Paris. That was a
                    very happy experience. We lived right on the Champ de Mars, under the Eiffel
                    Tower. We had a little Dauphine car—our very first. We lived a very lovely,
                    personal life. We had good friends, we did a lot of traveling around. My wife
                    had friends in the American community. The French weren't terribly welcoming,
                    but we learned that—or she learned it. Also, and far more important, it answered
                    the question in her mind—and in the minds of many wives and mothers—as to
                    whether children could get along in the Foreign Service. She had wondered what
                    she could do, how she could live—especially in a country where what is spoken is
                    not your first language, and things are “different.” Living under the Eiffel
                    Tower was an aspect commented on by all kinds of friends and relatives. That was
                    a very “plus” part of the assignment. Another “plus” part—and maybe you sensed
                    this from my answers to your questions about NATO—was that the Ambassador and my
                    colleagues were pleasant, professional people.</p>
                <p>However, Mike Rives, who was Staff Aide to our Ambassador to France, Amory
                    Houghton—a very distinguished, wonderful man—went on home leave. Then his father
                    died, and he was gone from Paris for about three or four months. So I was
                    designated to replace him, temporarily. I think that this was the “off” season
                    in NATO, the “mois d'ao�t,” or the “month of August,” when most French take
                    their vacations. We used to say that the biggest secret we had in NATO was that
                    during the month of August, when everyone goes home, the Soviets could take over
                    Western Europe if they set their mind to it.</p>
                <p>That job was totally different from my job as Staff Aide to Ambassador Burgess in
                    USRO. It was much more personal, more involved, and much more “traditional
                    Foreign Service,” if you will. Amory Houghton was a wonderful man and a complete
                    gentleman. He had been President of Corning Glass and Steuben Glass and all
                    that. He was a very warm person—he trusted me with everything. Fortunately,
                    Charlie Yost was the DCM — Deputy Chief of Mission, number two in the Embassy.
                    When he was briefing me on my new duties, he said, “Remember, you will know more
                    than anyone in this Embassy about that man. You will know more of his
                    weaknesses. You will know more about things that you can't tell anybody, and you
                    won't want to tell anybody.” Not that Amory Houghton was a “dirty old man.” Yost
                    said: “The hardest part of your job—and the most important part of your job—is
                    learning the integrity you must show at all times being close to power.”</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>I did, indeed, learn this, but it was also a lot of fun. The job was an active
                    one. I would have the French Foreign Minister on the phone. All kinds of things
                    happened, if you want me to describe associations with powerful people. There
                    was Ambassador Robert D. Murphy, who had previously been Consul General in
                    Algiers prior to the Allied landings in North Africa in 1942 and who handled
                    negotiations with the French looking toward an orderly Allied takeover of that
                    area. But at the time we're talking about he was deeply involved in the
                    negotiations with the French independence movement in North Africa, which he
                    conducted from his base in Paris. He had an office around the corner from mine.
                    He was “the” U.S. expert on French-North African affairs, and most respected. He
                    went to the highest position in the Foreign Service: Career Ambassador. There
                    were contacts of that kind in my job with Ambassador Houghton.</p>
                <p>The NATO experience was interesting, involving the consideration of Soviet
                    behavior and all of that. But there was a far more direct and personal
                    relationship with Ambassador Houghton.</p>
                <p>One day Ambassador Houghton buzzed me. I went in. He said, “I've got Secretary of
                    State Dulles on the phone. I want you to hear this.” Often that is what staff
                    aides did with Dulles: they transcribed what he said. You could be sure that he
                    had somebody on the phone in the Department listening in and also taking
                    notes.</p>
                <p>The subject matter might have involved the Suez Canal or North Africa. I remember
                    that it was a very important issue at the time. Ambassador Houghton said, “No,
                    Foster! It's wrong, Foster. No, it won't work. I can tell you that it won't.”
                    Then Ambassador Houghton said, after Dulles had said something, “OK, you're paid
                    to be the boss.” The Ambassador hung up and said to me, “Who the hell is running
                    the show around here? That railroad has no one in charge of it.” So you got
                    these little, marvelous bits and pieces—unusual for an inexperienced
                    officer.</p>
                <p>The other story was far more personal, far more heartening. Ambassador Houghton
                    had cancer of the larynx. He had had an operation for this condition before he
                    came to Paris. He had a box-like affair in his throat. He would exhale air
                    across it in his larynx. That was the way he spoke. He could talk, and it came
                    out all right, but it was a very difficult process, and you obviously had to
                    listen carefully. He had difficulty in talking, as he was blowing air. He had
                    trained himself. Perhaps he had some other device to help him.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>On every July 4 we had a routine. Every American Ambassador at the time did this.
                    And I was associated with the routine when I returned as Consul General. You
                    went to the grave of Lafayette, the great French leader who, in effect, “won”
                    the American Revolution for us. The American Ambassador always made a speech on
                    the occasion and deposited a wreath of flowers. The flag was displayed. This was
                    a traditional event. You also had to bow a little bit to the Comte de Somebody,
                    who was Lafayette's heir, supposedly. In my time he was a pompous jerk. The
                    Ambassador asked me to draft a little speech on the occasion. He said, “I want
                    it translated into French.” The Ambassador took French lessons every day at the
                    residence. At 6:00 AM every day, if I remember correctly, the French teacher
                    arrived. As the great day approached, the Ambassador said, “I'm going to try to
                    give the speech in French.” So I translated it and then had a French speaker do
                    a “real” translation. So the Ambassador had the English and the French versions
                    when we got to the grave side—just he and I in his limo, flag flying—and maybe a
                    military attach� to make the ceremony “look pretty.”</p>
                <p>I watched the Ambassador at the grave side. He reached into his right pocket,
                    where he had the English version. He looked at it and then reached his hand into
                    his left pocket and took out the French version. Then and there I choked up. I
                    was on the verge of tears at the effort the Ambassador was making. He got about
                    the first line out and then put it back in his pocket. He had memorized the
                    speech in French. That's a personal anecdote, but the memory of it stays with me
                    clearly to this day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your interaction with the “locals” the
                        French?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: The “locals”—or Foreign Service Nationals (FSNs), as we call them
                    today—are a very interesting subject. I talked a little bit about this in my
                    previous interview. We had the World War II phenomenon with FSNs who were local
                    employees of the Embassy or the Consulates—people who went to work, in many
                    cases not particularly well trained. They perhaps did not speak English very
                    well. After all, 1956 was only about 10 years after the end of World War II. A
                    lot of the French “local” employees of our Embassy and Consulates were not very
                    competent. I certainly have complete respect for “local” employees who were
                    competent, and I could name them. However, an awful lot of them were getting
                    “desperate.” They were in their 50's. Some even recognized that they knew that
                    they had probably exceeded their level of competence. They were going to “hang
                    on” to their jobs for obvious reasons. So we did have some problems.</p>
                <p>Now, as far as the Staff Aide to the Ambassador in Paris was concerned, there was
                    no problem whatsoever, because the Staff Aide and the French “locals” get along,
                    by definition. I knew that there were all kinds of things going on, and they
                    reached me. Very properly, they formed a union, but it was very ineffective. I
                    was involved in that. The Administrative Counselor and the DCM were obviously
                    very much involved but I had a piece of the action..</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>The answer to your question is that this was the beginning of “troubled times.”
                    When I was in Paris as Consul General (1978-81), they were reaching their peak.
                    Many of our local employees were then in their 60's and were being “encouraged”
                    or forced to retire. I understand that the Foreign Service Nationals in our
                    posts in Germany were in an even worse position than the French.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the record, can you explain what “Foreign Service
                        National” means?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: We used to call them “Foreign Service Local” employees. That was part of
                    the problem. Understandably, they didn't like to be called “locals,” which had a
                    pejorative implication and was used at times in a pejorative sense. The “Foreign
                    Service National,” to use a politically more correct term, is usually a citizen
                    of the nation where the post is located. He or she is hired by the American
                    personnel officers and section chiefs to perform essentially clerical or
                    secretarial, unclassified—from a security classification standpoint—functions.
                    The jobs are usually labor intensive—in the Consular Section, for example.
                    However, they have continuity. The FSNs stay on for many years. The American
                    junior officers at the post come and go. The Ambassadors come and go. The
                    Foreign Service National is simply “loaded” with knowledge. Sometimes, he or she
                    has the wrong kind of knowledge. In Beirut, for example, they sometimes gave out
                    misinformation, because egos were involved or there were conspiracies against
                    certain groups, or whatever. So you could have a negative side to Foreign
                    Service Nationals.</p>
                <p>However, I would say that the positive side was first and foremost. They were
                    loyal to the United States, with some exceptions. They sometimes were put in
                    jail. However, I'm thinking of France. They were bureaucratic, but that word
                    comes with the language.</p>
                <p>In consular work we may have supervised them better. However, we certainly
                    recognized that they were passive in their attitude. Also, remember well that
                    they usually were in direct contact with the public. In the rest of the Embassy,
                    this was not so much the case. Yes, there were receptionists in direct contact
                    with the public. In the Political Section some of them went out and made
                    contacts with certain political parties. For the most part the Administrative
                    Section had the largest number of Foreign Service National employees—budget and
                    fiscal, general services, and all that. They did mainly staff work, if you
                    will.</p>
                <p>About this time, or certainly in the 1960s, we reduced significantly the U.S.
                    Foreign Service Staff corps in the Foreign Service. We now have, in consular
                    work, for example, only Foreign Service Officers. Foreign Service secretaries
                    and communications experts are specialists in what continues as a Staff corps.
                    However, a lot of the clerical work at our posts that was formerly done by the
                    Staff Corps is now done by Foreign Service Nationals.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was special about NATO—your Paris assignment at the
                        time of which we are speaking? What did you learn from it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Well, hopefully, I learned how to be a Foreign Service Officer. I think
                    that I learned more about the traditional Foreign Service, and from a very
                    important vantage point in Embassy Paris. In USRO I learned a lot about
                    international relations and politics and power. One of the most important things
                    to learn in the Foreign Service is how to be around power—how to be around rank,
                    privilege, snobbism. How to be around an awful lot of things that you were not
                    necessarily taught at home. In French society you would be taught about them.
                    Obviously, lots of Americans are very conversant with power and all that but who
                    don't come from IBM (International Business Machines) and Amory Houghton's
                    background, and the like. Now, that style of operation has to be done well and
                    most professionally — and above all as a real representative of the United
                    States. Every so often we “lost” a few people who “sank” into the local
                    background, as occasionally happened, for example, at our Consulate in Nice
                    France. Like associating with Grace Kelly, the Princess of Monaco, and David
                    Niven and the glitterati. It goes to their head, if you will.</p>
                <p>I think that my wife and I learned that right away. If you're standing next to
                    the President of the United States, so what else is new? More importantly, you
                    learn the techniques of how to get along—how one writes, organizes, defends
                    oneself. If you can't talk on your feet, understand why the other person thinks
                    the way he or she does—differently, because they are from a different culture,
                    you're in trouble professionally. Somehow, you have to relate to those around
                    you, and empathize with them. At the same time you must remember that you are
                    there to protect your own country. Therefore, you're trying to learn how a
                    different culture or political setting works, so that you can better defend your
                    own country and better explain your own society. Those are the American
                    representatives who are the best. You know, there were 15 NATO countries and
                    France by itself. You were exposed to a lot of very important, learning
                    experiences. You also learn how to survive. I learned very, very quickly that
                    good personal relationships are vital. You might be transferred to another post,
                    but maybe that other person will come back and haunt you some day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After Paris you were transferred to the Consulate in
                        Birmingham, England. How did the transfer come through and how did you hear
                        about it? What was your reaction?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>MORGAN: I guess it was normal, in the sense that this was the first time that I
                    was ever transferred from one Foreign Service post to another. I think I had a
                    telephone call from the Department ahead of time. We didn't have “bid lists” in
                    those days. We weren't encumbered by that. As a matter of fact, it's kind of
                    amusing to those who are interested in the subject. You arranged for a transfer
                    by getting out the “Foreign Service List,” which lists those assigned to all
                    posts and the date of their expected transfer to another post. You went through
                    it, looking for a date of transfer at the kind of post you wanted to go to. I
                    did that and selected the Consulate in Birmingham, among others. I thought that
                    I would like a nice place, and my wife thought that she would like to go to a
                    post where they spoke English.</p>
                <p>In looking through the “Foreign Service List” I came across the name of a fellow
                    that I knew. We had worked together some time in the State Department. His name
                    was Dave Ortwein. Dave was due to leave Birmingham, England, at the very time
                    that I was due for a transfer from Paris, after allowing for home leave. So I
                    telephoned him and said, “Dave, what is your replacement's name?” He said, “Oh,
                    I don't have one. Hey, you'd love it, Bill. It's great here. As a matter of
                    fact, you'd probably like it better. My wife thinks it's terrible.” I said,
                    “Look, how about my flying up there and seeing it?” He said, “Yeah, why don't
                    you?” So, on my own, I paid my own way, flew up to Birmingham and looked the
                    place over. Obviously, I had talked it over with my wife, who found the idea of
                    Birmingham as our next assignment rather interesting. I told my personnel
                    officer in the Department that I would be interested in an assignment there. So
                    we left it to the Consulate in Birmingham to put me in as a qualified
                    replacement for Dave. You'll never guess what happened. I received orders in the
                    mail, transferring me to Birmingham, England in 1958.</p>
                <p>So, after we had home leave, we went by ship to Birmingham, England. I would call
                    this manner of assignment rather “normal” for those days. You inquired into a
                    place, asked a few questions, and put your name in the hopper. Now, of course,
                    you have a process of “open bidding” for posts. You have a whole bunch of people
                    applying for a job. You don't have to arrange things “independent” of the
                    system. However, I think that the old way of handling assignments was better,
                    and I suspect is a method still used in part.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much time did you have available? You said that you
                        had home leave coming after your Paris assignment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: I think that I had two months of home leave.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you stay when you were on home leave?</hi>

                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>MORGAN: That's always the problem when you go home. We stayed with our family.
                    You discover very quickly that after people ask you a few questions, such as,
                    “How was it in Paris?”—some 30 seconds to one minute later, they're “turned
                    off.” They're no longer interested. We made a “Salade Nicoise,” a delightful
                    salad, for my father and mother. They admitted that they didn't like anchovies.
                    They thought that hard boiled eggs and lettuce made no sense whatsoever. So that
                    ended our recollections of life in Paris, because people weren't really
                    interested.</p>
                <p>More importantly, how do you “divide” the time of four people? There were my wife
                    and I and our two children.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll want to come back to this matter again. Let's get
                        back to Birmingham. Tell us a little bit about the history of the Consulate
                        and the state in which you found it in 1958, when you arrived.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Birmingham was a “traditional” Consulate. It was a small post, with two
                    officers assigned. It had about five Foreign Service Nationals. It was a
                    “constituent post,” one of about six or seven under the Embassy in London. We
                    had Consulates in Cardiff Wales, Southampton, Manchester, Birmingham, and
                    Edinburgh Scotland, and Belfast, Northern Ireland.. However, in the “good old
                    days” we had 20 or 30 Consulates in the U.K. As our readers know—and you do,
                    too—consulates are opened for one or two basic reasons. One is to provide
                    service to American citizens. The second reason is to protect American seamen
                    and maritime commercial interests. That is in reverse order of importance. Our
                    consulates were first opened in seaports. Then they grew into commercial and
                    business oriented centers, supporting tourism, and so forth. Finally, after
                    World War II, the issuance of and requirement for visas grew enormously. There
                    were refugees and a general increase in non-immigrant visas. Our consulates grew
                    and grew to perform such consular functions. They supported embassies in
                    providing political, commercial, and economic information services and so
                    on.</p>
                <p>The Consulate in Birmingham had been there since the middle of the 19th century,
                    if not earlier in that century. Birmingham is the second largest city in Great
                    Britain. It was the heart of the “Midlands” of Great Britain, the heart of the
                    commercial and industrial section of the country, which included Coventry, the
                    automobile factories, and so on Real Charles Dickens stuff.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>I would pause at this point and say that we “supported” the Embassy, but there
                    was an understandable “competition” between the various Consulates and the
                    Embassy. For example, reporting on automobiles—there we were near Coventry. Why
                    didn't the Embassy ask us for some of the information needed? The reason is that
                    there was an enormous Economic Section in the Embassy and we in consulates would
                    not dare “step on the toes” of the Economic Officers, who were trained in
                    economics, whereas I was merely trained in the French language. So they tended
                    to think that I couldn't begin to understand economic reporting. There was a
                    sort of “competition” which I also noticed when I was Consul General in France
                    between small Consulates and the Embassy. If an officer in a Consulate reported
                    directly back to the Department without going through the Embassy, he would be
                    in “trouble.” Good Consulate Officers knew enough not to do that.</p>
                <p>But what kind of political reporting was there for us to do in the consulates,
                    such as Birmingham? Did the Embassy “care” what the Lord Mayor of Birmingham was
                    thinking as a center of local “power?” However, not everything was in London.
                    There are centers of industrial, economic, financial, and business power in
                    places like Birmingham. Did the Embassy want to hear from us? Oh, they thought
                    it would be very nice if we had something to report. So this left us in somewhat
                    of a quandary as to what to report. However, I might get a question over the
                    phone. The Economic Counselor or an officer from the Political Section might
                    call you and say that they understand that this and that and so and so. Could
                    you look into it? We had general guidelines from the State Department and the
                    Embassy about subjects to “keep our eyes on.”</p>
                <p>I think I can give you one, marvelous, perhaps classic example. I would try out
                    ideas on my first boss in Birmingham, but he spent most of his time preparing
                    for his retirement. In fact, he dozed off at his desk for a good share of the
                    day. He was a very nice man, but he seemed more interested in his social and
                    home life. He left everything to me, which was agreeable to both of us. He said,
                    “Yes” to almost everything that I suggested. I said to him one day, “You know,
                    there is a series of articles in the local paper about social unrest in
                    Birmingham. And in this area, traditionally the immigrants have over the decades
                    come from poorer Ireland and often end up as bus drivers, cook and bottle
                    washers, and do other 'staff' work. They are now being replaced by Jamaicans.” I
                    said that, not only are the Irish troubled by this, but they're losing jobs. And
                    there is the “black-white” problem. As I came from a country which was a little
                    more conversant with it than Great Britain, I sensed that there was something
                    there to report on. My boss agreed.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>So I went to see the Lord Mayor of Birmingham and did a lot of research on this.
                    A number of social workers had done recent studies on it. I wrote a “masterful”
                    airgram on this subject. In those days “Airgrams” were simply typed reports sent
                    to the Department by diplomatic air pouch. This magnificent report went to the
                    Department of State. It covered what I regarded as serious, social unrest in the
                    Midlands of Great Britain. I cited sources and wasn't just making this up. I
                    received a commendation back from the Department of State. You used to receive
                    formal “evaluations” on your reports on a special form. A copy of this
                    evaluation was placed in your personnel file. It said that this was one of the
                    greatest reports—well constructed and well researched. The conclusion of the
                    evaluation, however, was that the report was irrelevant to the Department of
                    State. It stated that, “Since we are not involved in sociological studies, we
                    have no use for your airgram at all.” As a matter of fact, I have been thinking
                    of going down to the National Archives in Washington to see if it is still on
                    file there!</p>
                <p>We also received some telegrams by commercial channels. One day we received a
                    telegram from the Department through commercial channels which was encoded. The
                    telegram said that we had just landed somewhere or someone had just invaded
                    us—something earthshaking like that. I spent hours decoding the damned telegram.
                    By the time I finished this message, the newspapers on the street were
                    announcing what the event was—we'd landed in Lebanon!</p>
                <p>So that is how you get into political and economic reporting. I did reports on
                    Coventry, on the tire industry, on banking, and on a lot of different things,
                    but almost all of them were not “volunteer” reports like the big Airgram I
                    wrote. These other reports were done at the request of the Embassy. They were
                    fun to do. I would go out, meet people, and collect information.</p>
                <p>All of that probably took about one-quarter of my time. I would say that about
                    50% of my time was spent on general management of the Consulate. As I said, my
                    first boss tended to doze, so virtually all personnel issues and staff direction
                    came to me. My second leader was a self-proclaimed reporting officer who
                    disliked consular and administrative work. He did write well. I went to him one
                    day and said, “You know, this Consulate is in a terrible location.” It was
                    downtown, no parking and poor public access, crowded, and so on. We had a
                    Foreign Service National doing commercial contact work. He had an office, my
                    boss had an office, I had an office, and we had a big, well-lit open space where
                    all the other Consulate FSNs worked and the reception area was located..</p>
                <p>My boss said, “Yes, we should do something about it.” And the Department also
                    said, “Yes.” Back in those days you frequently got “Yes's” from the Department
                    of State when you asked for something. We were authorized to arrange to build a
                    new Consulate. So I got out the Foreign Service Manual to find out how you build
                    a new Consulate. I really started from scratch. The Department said, “Go ahead
                    and arrange for it. You'll find instructions in Section So and So of the Foreign
                    Service Manual.” And there the instructions were—pages and pages of them. I
                    followed the instructions, with no real direction from anyone but with the
                    encouragement of the Administrative Counselor in the Embassy in London.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>There was a new building under construction in Birmingham—still on the drawing
                    board. I learned about it from social contacts. The builder said that he would
                    love to have the American Consulate in his new building. He said that he would
                    give us this and that free. He asked us to give him an outline of what we
                    wanted. So I literally did it—my very first building. I've been doing it ever
                    since. It was a lot of fun. Four years later, the Consulate was closed, as it
                    was considered no longer to be of any use to the United States Government!</p>
                <p>I should come back to an over-all accounting for my time. That new consulate part
                    was obviously part of the administrative segment — 50% of the overall. It
                    obviously, went on for months.</p>
                <p>The consular work accounted for a lot of our time. As a land-locked district we
                    didn't have any work related to American seamen. I touched on the one case
                    involving a seaman in my previous interview. We had a lot of visa work to do. In
                    those days issuance of visitor's or student visas involved finger printing and
                    detailed FBI examinations, etc. It was tedious, demeaning, and “by the book.” It
                    was under the previous, McCarthy-era (McCarran-Walter Act of 1952], which was
                    very restrictive. In the first place, any kind of “communist” association was
                    grounds for refusal of the visa. Of course, there we were, in the “heartland” of
                    communism in Great Britain. There were a lot of labor unions there and a lot of
                    these “suspicious” socialist-type persons. We had all kinds of investigative
                    tools.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a Lookout List?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Oh, yes, it was terribly dated and didn't include a lot of people that it
                    should have. So our investigations were mostly based on the questionnaire and
                    the application that the visa applicants filled out. We did not issue immigrant
                    visas. This was all done at the Embassy in London. We had British help of the
                    highest order. Nothing was handled by mail. Every applicant had to be seen in
                    person. I had to see them and put questions to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your rank when you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: When I arrived in Birmingham, I was Vice-Consul. My boss was the Consul
                    and Principal Officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the record, who was your boss?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>MORGAN: During the first year in Birmingham my boss was Harold Pease. I've called
                    him a sleepy guy. Actually, he was a delightful person. His wife was equally
                    charming and very helpful and supportive of my wife. Our families got along very
                    well. Harold retired from the Foreign Service from Birmingham. He and his wife
                    went back to California and he died shortly thereafter. They had one child, a
                    daughter. This was a tragedy. She came into the Foreign Service as a secretary..
                    I got a phone call from the Pease's when we were back in Washington studying
                    Russian. They said that their daughter was driving across the country and was
                    killed in an automobile accident; she had planned to stay with us in the
                    beginning. That was the end of their connection with the Foreign Service. I
                    still keep in touch with Flora Pease. A true Foreign Service tale. My other boss
                    in Birmingham died recently. He was a more active person. His name Ken Atkinson.
                    He was much more active. Before his arrival I was promoted to Consul. You asked
                    at lunch today how we handle promotions, titles and ranks. There were the
                    positions of Consul and Vice-Consul—and I was promoted to Consul. Harold Pease
                    was replaced by another Consul. I was the “number two” person at the Consulate
                    and still in the vice-consul's position. But I had the title “Consul” on my
                    visiting cards, once promoted by the State Department's Evaluation (Promotion)
                    Panels. So, to confuse all our friends and officials , we had two “Consuls” at
                    the Consulate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your diplomatic rank was “Consul?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: No. If I had been in an Embassy, my diplomatic rank would have been
                    Second Secretary. I was promoted to Consul while in Birmingham.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And your position?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: My position was that of vice-consul.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So your personal rank was Consul, but your functional
                        position was that of vice-consul.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes, because I was promoted to the rank of Consul. It was only of
                    importance when you had your visiting cards printed!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell me something about the people who were
                        interested in coming to the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>MORGAN: During my two years in Birmingham there were only two visa applicants I
                    really remember.. One of them simply made our Consulate staff fall apart. One of
                    the young staff female employees came into my office, absolutely trembling. She
                    said that Paul Anka, the singer, was outside. He was a Canadian. and needed a
                    visa because he was overseas and going as a performer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The young women in the Consulate were all excited?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes. They were in their 20's and were all squeaking: Paul Anka! I didn't
                    know who Paul Anka was, which was even worse! The other applicant was a very
                    haughty industrial figure. He was very difficult to understand, given his heavy
                    British accent. My secretary came in and whispered that he was absolutely
                    impossible to deal with. He insisted talking to no one but me. I said, “Is he a
                    commie or does he have something to tell me?” She said, “Oh, no, he just hates
                    this.” And he had gone on with my consular clerk about the 1956 crisis over Suez
                    and all of that sort of thing. I looked at the visa application and tried to ask
                    a few very polite questions. His name was French: Beaulieu, which I pronounced
                    in French. He roared up from his chair, lividly red, and reddening, screaming
                    “My name is 'Buelee' ever since 1066 and all that!” Clearly I had mispronounced
                    his name and given the French pronunciation most inexcusably. I had visions of
                    my namesake, William the Conqueror, roaring up to my defense.. The other visa
                    applications were quite routine!</p>
                <p>I don't think that we had more than 10 applicants per day, if that. Our
                    applicants consisted of businessmen, students, and women who had married GI's
                    (World War II soldiers). An awful lot of the GI's had married in Great Britain.
                    I had served there for about two or three months before crossing over to
                    Normandy, but I was too young to get amorously involved.</p>
                <p>One of the most important social and semi-official jobs that I had was that I was
                    Honorary President of the Transatlantic Brides' Association. Once every six
                    months my wife and I were invited to their dinner, and I was expected to make a
                    speech. I'm not sure that everybody understands what consular work can involve,
                    sometimes. You get very close to the people!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the purpose of that association?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>MORGAN: That's a very good question. I think that the mothers of these brides
                    tended to feel that they had “lost” their daughters who were now living in the
                    United States. The mothers traveled to the U. S. for visits, and children were
                    born, but they wanted a closer contact with America and those families of the
                    same situation.. It was a friendly kind of association. It definitely promoted
                    Anglo-American ties, in the very best sense of the word. The dinners were as
                    “dull” as anything could possibly be. They put us up on shaky pedestal-type
                    seats. The room was filled with mothers—and, perhaps, a few brides. There were
                    children dancing in front of us in some sort of ballet in the middle of the
                    room. My wife turned to me and said, “You couldn't wipe that silly grin off your
                    face if you tried, could you?” And it was true. You had to keep a smile on your
                    face all through the evening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a good lead-in to your contacts with the British
                        people. How were they, and what kind of relationships did you develop?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: My wife always felt that Birmingham was one of the happiest posts she
                    ever served in. We had wonderful relationships with local people. There was no
                    separation between “official” and “family” friends. The home we lived in was a
                    huge, Victorian mansion. We lived in half of it. A delightful British couple,
                    landlords, with two children lived in the other half. Their children were about
                    the same age as ours. He was the Honorary Thai Consul in Birmingham. I don't
                    know how he got the appointment; he was a stockbroker. He was a marvelous and
                    personal friend. This was the period after the Suez Crisis of 1956.</p>
                <p>I remember that incredible, rude man who came for a visitor's visa, but most of
                    the people were nothing like that. Remember that the Midlands of England is
                    something like Quebec in Canada. The people are very friendly to Americans and
                    appear to be very similar to us in terms of experience. They are hard working
                    people—industry and business oriented. They are not like the people of southern
                    England who are very “British” and very conservative. In the Midlands, anyone
                    who was “haughty” was cut down very quickly by the realities of working in that
                    area. Remember, this is Dickens' country, with a lot of social and housing
                    problems. An American consular officer serving in Birmingham is very close to
                    local officialdom. You know all the presidents of the banks, company presidents,
                    and so forth. You deal with these people all of the time. You know the Lord
                    Mayor of the city, the Papal representative, and all of that. There was only one
                    other Consul in Birmingham—the French Consul. There were a number of honorary
                    consuls, but the French Consul was the only other “career” consul.</p>

                <p>Perhaps more importantly, from a personal standpoint, a lot of my official
                    contacts were sources for things I wanted to know for political or economic
                    reports I might want to “feed into the Embassy.” I could get reactions to
                    specific developments. I could say to one of my contacts, “What do you think
                    about this or that?” Down at the level of my age group, I knew a number of
                    lawyers. One of them was determined to be a Member of Parliament and still is
                    today — Tony Beaumont-Dark. He was about my age. Those people would talk to you.
                    They would talk to you as friends—special kinds of friends. They would also
                    “pick my brains,” if you will. It was a very warm and mutual relationship. Our
                    children's school brought us into contact with another group of people. Almost
                    every night we would be doing something social—and something that we liked and
                    wanted to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like what, for example?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Dinners, receptions, cocktail parties, and picnics. I remember trying out
                    a picnic on the Fourth of July. We had to cook inside, because that was the only
                    place that we could build a fire. I think that the temperature was only 39
                    degrees (Fahrenheit)!. I think that it was close to what my wife and I had known
                    in the United States. Relationships were certainly closer than they were in New
                    York. Also, part of it came from our having “official” status. This was very
                    satisfying, too. You got a lot of professional “feed back.” You knew whether you
                    were doing all right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And your contacts with the Embassy—your promotion?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: That was welcome, of course. It showed that I had done something right, I
                    guess.But that was for my days in USRO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the drawbacks to serving in such a small
                        Consulate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: None that come to mind. I say that in terms of our age and experience. It
                    was our second assignment overseas. Our family was growing. We had the comfort
                    of being in an English-speaking country. We didn't have that added challenge, if
                    you will—or burden—of taking on, in some cases, an incomprehensible language, or
                    one which was incomprehensible to some of us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did your wife do while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>MORGAN: She raised our children. She did some volunteer work at the local
                    hospital. She was involved in school, because the children were in fourth grade
                    and kindergarten. She had calls from the kindergarten principal, because our son
                    was having a terrible time in class. He was in a class of 10 or 12 British kids.
                    They had all decided to speak with an American accent, and our son was supposed
                    to learn to speak with a British accent! The teacher was fighting this young
                    American's contagious accent on the class.. We had an Irish domestic servant to
                    help us with the kids and housework.. She was more of a challenge than she was a
                    help. That sounds like, “What do you do with the maids?”</p>
                <p>My wife had a lot of friends. Among our friends were a Dutch couple. He was a
                    director/owner of C &amp; A, a big department store. There were a lot of friends
                    like that. People liked to be friendly, talk about relations between countries.
                    They liked Americans in this part of England.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds as if one of the most valuable things you got
                        out of your experience there was the construction of the new Consulate. That
                        was your introduction to the way the Department operates. Can you expand on
                        that a bit more?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes. I think that there were two things, which don't exist any more.
                    There was this sense of power and, yes, the construction of the Consulate. It
                    was all new to me. There was that feeling that no one was getting in my way.
                    There was no one from FBO [Foreign Building Operations] coming out from
                    Washington. There was nobody from the Embassy, telling me what to do. I was
                    given, I think, a financial limit in spending on the construction of the new
                    Consulate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: None of that exists today.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: You can't do anything like that, and you have no real authority and
                    limited decision-making power—the Ambassador included. I was only 33. Also, I
                    learned. I talked to architects, construction people, and the staff of the
                    Consulate. I had already been in Birmingham a year, so I knew pretty much what I
                    needed to make a good layout. The staff might not always agree with me, but I
                    always asked and explained...and they were a bit subservient in manner, as
                    British staff could be then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, your two-year tour was up in 1960. How did you decide
                        where to go?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>MORGAN: Oh, I have to tell you that story. I received two notices. The diplomatic
                    pouch arrived on a train, with a courier from the Embassy. He would get on the
                    train in London once every three weeks. He had a pouch, containing both
                    classified and unclassified material. We received open mail material directly
                    through the open mails. However, the diplomatic pouch contained all of the
                    official mail and all of the classified material. In between the pouches were
                    these telegraphic messages in code. You had to get out your “One Time Pad” to
                    decode them. That's a separate subject which I won't bore you with.</p>
                <p>Anyhow, the courier arrived with the diplomatic pouch. The courier continued on
                    to Manchester and Edinburgh. He made the “round.” I had to go to the train
                    station and meet that specific train, because he would hand the pouch out the
                    window, and away he would go. I took the pouch to the Consulate and removed the
                    classified material and put it in the safe. There was the official mail and then
                    personal mail. I took the personal mail to my house.</p>
                <p>There were two letters in the pouch for me—one from John Stutesman, my old friend
                    from USRO in Paris who had gone on to be Special Assistant to Loy Henderson,
                    then the “Dean” of the Foreign Service. He was the first Under Secretary for
                    Management—the first person to hold that position. He was really a more
                    important person than the Director General of the Foreign Service. Anyhow, John
                    Stutesman had gotten himself a nice assignment. He sent me this letter, saying
                    how happy he was that I had done so well that I had been chosen to be Consul
                    General in Edinburgh! I was moving within the United Kingdom, if you will. I was
                    delighted that I would be Consul General—a promotion, indeed, in terms of
                    responsibility. Edinburgh was a good-sized post, with four or five officers.
                    This definitely represented a step up. I was confident that I could handle the
                    job.</p>
                <p>There was another letter, addressed to William D. Morgan, Esquire. Maybe it said,
                    “Esq.” This was from the Director General and Director Personnel. It started
                    out, “Mr. Morgan, we are very pleased to inform you that you have been chosen,
                    under a very selective system, to go into Russian language training and to go to
                    Moscow.” I was beginning to learn more and more about the Foreign Service and
                    the State Department. When I told my wife, she said, “What do you want to do?” I
                    said, “I don't see how I can get out of Russian language training and assignment
                    to the Soviet Union.” She said, “You'll probably be promoted faster. This will
                    mean more money,” and all of that. I said, “I guess I'll do that.” So I
                    telephoned John Stutesman in the Department of State the next day and told him
                    about it. John was irate. He said, “This is impossible. I'll get back to you.”
                    His boss, Loy Henderson, was, in effect, the boss of the Foreign Service. Well,
                    Loy Henderson wasn't the boss after all, and I got a call back from John saying,
                    “No, Bill, you're going into Russian language training.” That's how I was
                    assigned to Russian and Moscow . Q: How did this happen?</p>
                <p>MORGAN: I don't know and never asked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You never even found out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>A: I never found out. I had no need to find out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No “need to know.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Right. Don't ask questions unless you want the answer to be what you want
                    it to be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What criteria were used to select you to go to
                        Russia?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>MORGAN: I don't know. I said to John Stutesman, “John, which am I going to?” We
                    were a very disciplined service then. If my wife and I had felt very strongly
                    about one or the other, I probably would have voiced some objection. I won't use
                    the word “naive,” but I really think that, during my entire career, I accepted
                    what came my way. Yes, calls are made, and expressions of interest are recorded.
                    However, I really don't think that I ever complained about or fought an
                    assignment. At that time I accepted out of a sense of discipline. And both of
                    these assignments appeared to promise good jobs. I really didn't know what a
                    “bad” job was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If you could put yourself back in time, can you say what
                        you expected or what the life of a Foreign Service Officer would be in the
                        Soviet Union in the early 1950's?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: That's a wonderful question, because my first answer is, “I really don't
                    remember.” I don't have any negative feelings coming back from my memory—no
                    anxieties, no fears, nothing like that, except how would this assignment affect
                    the children and my wife? I could never exclude them from this consideration.
                    Back in those days the Department sent the post report to us, and still does. In
                    those days it was very important and very helpful. It talked about schools and
                    living conditions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did the post report for Moscow say about
                        schools?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Well, it said that life in the Soviet Union was difficult, and facilities
                    were far from Western standards. It described the housing available. The Soviets
                    assigned certain buildings to foreign diplomats. The post report described, and
                    I subsequently learned, what it meant professionally to serve in the Soviet
                    Union. Service there clearly meant entry into a very special group. That was not
                    meant in a “snooty” way but in a proud, professional way. Everybody assigned to
                    Moscow at that time had to know Russian. I would be going through a year's study
                    of Russian in the United States and then a period of time at a university. As it
                    turned out these two years were followed by a few months in Oberammergau
                    Germany. So any anxieties that I might have had about the Moscow assignment and
                    about how I would be prepared linguistically, academically, and from the
                    intelligence point of view were quickly put to rest. I also soon learned that,
                    despite the form of government and the nature of the Soviet “beast,” there was
                    Russia, a country with a great history, with many similarities with the United
                    States.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>The wives, however, didn't get any preparation. They didn't receive Russian or
                    university training. On their own, they went to libraries to read about the
                    Soviet Union and Russian culture and history. When you're spending much of your
                    time raising children, running a home and adding to the income by part-time or
                    volunteer work you also don't have too much time to learn about the next tour of
                    duty. That, to me was the greatest drawback in the process of preparation for an
                    assignment, especially as demanding a one as to Moscow. Oh, my wife and I did
                    prepare for Moscow together. But a lot of it involved my passing on information
                    to her. She tried to study Russian but it's hard on one's own. It's a hard
                    language. She knew—and I knew—that her association with Russian-speaking people
                    would be next to zero. We could find English-speaking people, but we knew that
                    she would be excluded from contact with most individual Russians. I knew that my
                    job would not be speaking Russian so much but mostly reading, although I didn't
                    know that my duties as Publications Procurement Officer would take me all over
                    the Soviet Union and in close contact with Russians, at least
                    bookstoresalespersons!</p>
                <p>That is a lengthy answer, but I think that, maybe, this is a good time to go into
                    these considerations. What you're asking is how I felt at the beginning. My
                    first answer was, “I don't know, I don't remember.” Obviously, some of my answer
                    came at the beginning and some of it in the course of the two years of
                    preparation for this assignment. Q: I'm also trying to get at how you felt about
                    the Cold War and how that affected you as an “insider” in the U. S. Government,
                    how that affected your professional outlook.</p>
                <p>MORGAN: I think that I already partially answered that question when we talked
                    about NATO. I had had an introduction to the realities of the Cold War and
                    America's role in it. I learned some things about the Soviets and their system
                    then. There were intelligence reports in USRO about conditions in the Soviet
                    Union. Even though I read stacks of telegrams every morning, at first I did not
                    focus on the Soviet Union. However, I learned about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, you have covered it. Were you aware of the realities
                        of living in the Soviet Union, meaning the physical infrastructure, the
                        political structure, and so forth?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes, once I got into the training program. I absorbed a lot [in the
                    classes and then I started reading. The academic year at Columbia University—the
                    university I was assigned to after the year of Russian at FSI (1960 and
                    61)—obviously had a great deal of material and courses that related to the
                    Soviet Union and its authoritarian and ideological systems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're saying that you read enough to understand, as
                        opposed to what the general public knew, that the Soviet Union, on an
                        economic or physical level, was not a super power. Were you at that
                        point?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>MORGAN: That's a major question. I don't know that anybody could answer that yet.
                    If that had been the case, we wouldn't have done some of the things that we did.
                    I think that we thought of the Soviets as “10 foot giants.” But once we lived in
                    the Soviet midst and saw first hand we saw it indeed less as the superpower.</p>
                <p>On the very day that we left Moscow, bag and baggage, even the elevator in our
                    9-floor apartment—and we were on that floor—didn't work. How in hell could they
                    get to the moon? Looking back on it, I was aware of the very real weakness and
                    oppression in the system and the reasons why the system could fall.
                    Nevertheless, I was amazed when the Soviet Union fell—and the way that it did.
                    Now, today, I say that. Were we “hoodwinked?” We knew the weaknesses. However,
                    the Soviet Union seemed to have such strength, in terms of nuclear armaments,
                    KGB intelligence, and the total control of the population.</p>
                <p>My boss in the Political Section when I was in the Embassy in Moscow was Mac
                    Toon. He always said, “Don't you know how strong they are?” This point was
                    relevant the minute you stopped and thought, “These people are really weak!”</p>
                <p>But to return to your opening question on how I felt abut the assignment. I knew
                    that I was going to serve in the “heart” of the Foreign Service. I had learned
                    in USRO that given the realities of the Cold War that our Embassy in Moscow was
                    the heart of our Foreign Service efforts. An up and coming Foreign Service
                    Officer needed to have that particular ticket “punched.” The career path through
                    Moscow also was a very interesting and satisfying one. We knew also that there
                    had to be major changes in the Soviet Union. If not, we had a “sick joke” in
                    Moscow: If war comes, we'll go first, and clean, by “good” bombs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you had a big career change when you accepted the
                        assignment to Moscow. Part of the training involved two years of
                        preparation? One year at the FSI (Foreign Service Institute) And a second
                        year at Columbia. Was the university optional?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the year at Columbia University was part of the
                        program?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes. In those days it was a two-year training program. One year of
                    language training and a second year at a university. The university was chosen
                    each year. I was fortunate to be assigned to the Russian Institute at Columbia.
                    The State Department had used other universities, including the University of
                    California. The four other Foreign Service Officers and I who were in Russian
                    training on this route to Moscow were Dick Funkhouser, Tom Fain, Peter Semler,
                    and Carroll Woods. We went through nine months of Russian language training,
                    from September, 1960, until June, 1961. Just to confuse you, Carroll Woods went
                    right on to Moscow, in part because he had previously served there and largely
                    because he had position to fill immediately. Dick Funkhouser worked in the
                    summer months at the Army school in Oberammergau, Germany, and then to his more
                    senior job as Economic Counselor. But Fain, Semler and I were left to find a job
                    for ourselves in the three months before our academic year began.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Until the fall?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes, until the Russian Institute at Columbia started up in September,
                    1961. We were literally without a job. We were told to go anywhere we wanted to
                    go. I got a job in the Department in the East-West Exchanges Program in
                    Washington. There were three principal areas which dealt with Soviet affairs:
                    the Soviet desk in the Bureau of European Affairs; the East-West Exchanges
                    Program which, by then, had grown into a very important part of Soviet-American
                    bilateral relations; and the Soviet Union unit in the Office of Research for
                    Eastern Europe in INR (Bureau of Intelligence Research. The four of us went to
                    different places. One of the others went with me to the East-West Exchanges
                    Program.</p>
                <p>It was fascinating. We were engaged in negotiations with the Soviets during part
                    of this time. This was very helpful when I came back from the Embassy in Moscow
                    to the Soviet desk (EUR/SOV), because one of my areas of responsibility there
                    was to be SOV's representative on the committee handling the exchanges program
                    with the Soviet Union. This was a fascinating program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll come back to that later. Let's switch now to the
                        Foreign Service Institute and the beginning of your Russian language
                        training. Could you talk a little bit about the training and courses you
                        took at the Foreign Service Institute, from September, 1960, to June,
                        1961?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>MORGAN: I remember that time as days of agony, but most people who have gone
                    through language courses look at them with less than joy. Of course, as most of
                    those who read or listen to these tapes know, the FSI was one of the first
                    institutions to start a new type of language training. In fact, the FSI adopted
                    the system developed, I think, at Syracuse University. Like a child, you started
                    with simple phrases and kept building them up. You did not learn the “grammar”
                    of the language, as most of us, including me, learned French, for example.
                    Rather, you learned the language something like the way a child learns. It
                    involved constant repetition of words and phrases. I remember that the word for
                    “railroad” in Russian was insufferably long. We learned it in bits and pieces,
                    as it were. The system works. Of course, most of us older people—and we were all
                    well along in our 30's, and some in our 40's—had a terrible time adjusting to
                    this system. The three Russian teachers that we had found this system equally
                    difficult to adjust to. They all thought that this system was terrible. It was
                    hard for them, because they were repeating and repeating these words and
                    phrases.</p>
                <p>I will never forget some of these phrases and remember them to this day—even some
                    that I never used. Some of them were hard to pronounce. Pronouncing Russian is
                    hard for the American tongue. Some of the sounds are very difficult or virtually
                    impossible for us to duplicate—like Chinese, for example, or Arabic. However, by
                    drilling the words and phrases in this way, it somehow stays in your memory.
                    That's what it was—nine months of that. Of course, we made some progress, but we
                    never, ever, studied Russian “grammar.” We never, ever, made translations of
                    what we studied. We could never ask the teacher, “What does it mean? What are
                    you saying?” No, you had to say it in Russian. On the first day she would lift
                    up a pen or pencil and say in Russian, “What is this?” Then we would move on,
                    having no idea what the word meant. I think that we didn't have a book for two
                    months. This was deliberate, because they wanted these sounds driven into our
                    heads. Finally, we got a book. At the end of nine months I came out with a grade
                    of 3-3 (Speaking - Useful, and Reading - Useful). As many of you know, 0 is
                    none, 5 is absolutely bilingual. These numbers apply to both speaking and
                    reading a language. I was sort of in the middle, as most of us were.It's
                    difficult in most of the “hard” languages, such as Russian, Chinese, Arabic,
                    Albanian, and some others, to get a much higher score. The course in Arabic and
                    Chinese, I think, lasts for two years, before you reach a 3-3 level. The
                    alphabet would be completely different with Arabic, and Chinese uses characters
                    or ideographs, but that is irrelevant. First of all, we didn't even deal with an
                    alphabet, until we were well into the language. The Russian Cyrillic alphabet
                    makes sense. Some of the more difficult sounds are represented in it. The FSI
                    training system works, but it involves back-breaking effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it was a complete “immersion” system.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>MORGAN: Total. We would use tapes at night. We got quite a bit of homework. You
                    had your tapes, which you would take home. You played them back. Then, when we
                    did get books, we had a text which I still have. The pages are brown with age
                    and worn. The text “walked you through” both Cyrillic spelling and the phonetic
                    spelling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What can you tell us about the “focus” of the language
                        [training]? Did it all involve oral communication?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes. That's the only weak point. We complained about it. It was corrected
                    a bit when we got to Oberammergau, which I'll tell you about in due course. A
                    lot of the vocabulary was not “practical.” It did not involve how to analyze
                    what a visa applicant was saying or how to “deal with” a Soviet Intourist guide.
                    It all involved things like, “Hello. How are you today?” “Oh, I must go down to
                    the railroad,” with emphasis on some of the more sophisticated but necessary
                    parts of the complexities of the language. That is, whether this involves a
                    “verb of motion” or parts of an automobile, in full adjectival declension!. And
                    the grammar, of course, was simply insane. They didn't teach it as grammar, but
                    it was there—the complexities of the endings, the complexities of the verbs and
                    the conjugations. While we never conjugated a verb, as we know it in the
                    old-fashioned way of language instruction, it was all out there. The “immersion”
                    system supposedly got you into the grammar and syntax, but some of us could
                    never get rid of this feeling, “I would like to know the grammar and see how
                    this verb looks when it is conjugated.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How big was your class at the FS]? Did they all make it
                        through?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: They all made it through. We were five in the class, but never more than
                    two or three in a given class room at any one time. We were mixed around a bit.
                    The three persons in the class weren't always the same, though they tended to
                    be. I think that we were assigned at first into groups. One of them included
                    people like myself, who had “zero” knowledge of Russian. The other two had
                    either served in Moscow as Marine Guards or, perhaps, had studied Russian in
                    college. They had a little knowledge of Russian.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was their status—were they all Foreign Service

                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes. Dick Funkhouser's specialty was in petroleum. One had served in
                    Yugoslavia. Another one had previously served in Russia, but without the
                    language. Another one was married to a Russian woman. He spoke some Russian. He
                    was the first one to “break the old rule” of not serving in a communist country
                    with close family member ties to that country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did all of them end up in the Soviet Union at some

                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes. Some of us went directly out of the FSI and did not go to Columbia.
                    Three of us went to the Russian Institute at Columbia:</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us a little about why the Foreign Service wanted to
                        send you to Columbia and why they decided not to send other people in your
                        class to Columbia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Before World War II, and definitely during World War II, when people like
                    George Kennan went into the training program, the Department had a language and
                    area studies program. Some of the students attending it went to a university for
                    the language and area. By “area,” I mean the area of specialization of that
                    particular country. Cornell, Harvard, Columbia Universities and the University
                    of California at Berkeley were all used for Russian studies. Similar programs
                    existed for other languages and evolved into the FSI, plus one year area studies
                    such as the Russian one.</p>
                <p>When it was our turn to go to the area part we were told Columbia had been
                    picked. The year before that it may have been Harvard or Princeton. I presume
                    this was negotiated between the Office of Personnel in the State Department and
                    the university. Each year Personnel probably goes out and looks around at the
                    various universities. People in the State Department still go to universities.
                    They go for management studies, and there might still be some area studies. I
                    believe that there isn't a Russian language/area program any more.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you tell me something about the courses that you took
                        at Columbia and discuss the teachers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes. In fact, Columbia was a high point of my career. It was a brilliant,
                    wonderful year. The Department paid the tuition. You did not have to work for a
                    degree, but you did have to write a paper, which I did: “Soviet Ideology and
                    Science”. The people in the Department gave us some guidance, but they didn't
                    get into catalogues and say that we had to take this or that. We had to report
                    to the Department which courses we were signing up for. We then got an “OK” on
                    it.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>The assignment covered a full academic year. We were detailed to the Russian
                    Institute, which was, technically, our “home” at Columbia. The three of us
                    reported to the Russian Institute together and were assigned to a “mentor” by
                    the name of Zbigniew Brzezinski, who, at the time, was an eminent professor, or
                    at least so proclaimed by “Zbigy,” but maybe by a few others too. He ended up as
                    National Security Adviser with the Carter administration. With us he was very
                    helpful and understanding. I'll be very blunt about it. He said that he enjoyed
                    working with us because he also had to be a mentor to some of the military. He
                    found them very difficult at the educational and intellectual levels that he was
                    used to. He didn't like the military, as he proved later at the NSC.. We met
                    with him individually and the three of us as a group once a month.</p>
                <p>I didn't take any of my other courses with the other two FSOs except one on the
                    Soviet system with “Zbigy.” He was brilliant. He was the most impressive and
                    practical of the instructors during that whole year. I took courses on 16th and
                    19th century Russian literature, a course in Russian history, under Florinsky,
                    an eminent professor of Russian history. He “wrote the book,” as it were. This
                    course covered two semesters. I took a course in 20th century Russian/Soviet
                    economics and another course in what amounted to Soviet ideology, under a very
                    distinguished professor, whose name I've forgotten. I wrote my paper under him.
                    This largely covered the period of the 1930's and 1940's, when Stalin exercised
                    control over the sciences—particularly sociology, to make sure that they were
                    ideologically “pure.” There were other courses which I have forgotten. However,
                    I was free to study what I wanted. The “bottom line” for all of us was to build
                    a body of knowledge, not only for the history, economic life, and even present
                    day realities that affect the Soviet people, but to get a perception of the
                    “Soviet/Russian mind.” In other words, the realities of today and how they got
                    that way. I also took a course in Eastern European history as an elective. I
                    felt that I had to find out how the Soviet Bloc was operating.</p>
                <p>Area studies worked! Without that year I don't know how it would have been like.
                    However, I felt that, during my two years in Moscow and subsequent years on the
                    Soviet desk in the State Department, I was extremely well-equipped.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us, then, what your feelings were toward the Soviet
                        people and the Soviet Government— before you went to Moscow. Do you recall
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>MORGAN: I guess, to think back to that period, I probably felt like anybody who
                    knew anything about the Soviet Union in a primitive sense. I had done university
                    work in French and European history, so I knew something about Russia, but it
                    was just another “blob” up there on the map. I certainly didn't have any strong
                    feeling about it—except, of course, that after several years in the State
                    Department and in USRO in particular the Soviet Union was “the enemy.” However,
                    to be able to distinguish between Russia and Russian history, civilization, and
                    culture, and the Soviet Union—this is what Columbia University did for me. And
                    Brzezinski in particular. He was very good at this. I did another paper on Peter
                    the Great's visit to France—how he was “ripped apart” by the French and talked
                    down to. That gave me an insight into the complexities of their feeling as
                    “second class people” and how they learned that the world looked down on Russia.
                    On the religious side, my own knowledge of religion in Russia was very
                    limited.</p>
                <p>By the time I was ready to go to the Soviet Union—and particularly after my time
                    in Oberammergau, which came that summer, after the end of the course at
                    Columbia—I really felt that I knew the Russians. I felt that I could distinguish
                    between Soviet authoritarian dictatorship and the Ruskaya dusha, the Russian
                    soul. Some people argue that there is no such thing as a “soul,” and I was weak
                    on communism. However, I feel that you need to know that feeling to understand
                    fully the doings of the Russians. How you deal with it and how you take it
                    varies with the individual. My background in French literature, history, and so
                    on probably led me to have a greater appreciation for the history and
                    civilization of Russia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you thinking about the Russian people—how they
                        suffered under the Soviet Government and their mentality? Were you looking
                        beyond this Soviet mentality?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Well, I take your question but I can't answer it quite that way. The
                    Soviet Government and mentality, on the one hand, and the outlook of the Russian
                    people, on the other, are so interrelated. I think that I knew that 50
                    years—really, two generations under that controlled system—had made their
                    impact. As a result of my area studies I learned a lot about the Soviet system;
                    about half of my courses related to the Soviet controls and techniques. After
                    all, the Russian people were used to living in a controlled society. The Czar
                    obviously controlled the people, as their fathers and the church controlled
                    their lives. I knew that the Russian people had fought against that system of
                    control. They wrote about it, they mimicked it, and they wrote marvelous
                    comedies about those forms of control—especially during the 19th century. There
                    was a Russian “drive” not to be ashamed, to stand up—a feeling of nationalism,
                    if you will, which goes back to the 14th and 15th centuries. There were
                    intellectual schools of nationalism. I studied those movements and activities..
                    I guess that what I'm doing is twisting your question to say that it isn't a
                    matter of distinction. It's integration, or how the Russians survived. You can
                    ask this question today: how did the Russian people “tolerate” the Soviet
                    system? Because it was the only way to survive. You “ratted” on your mother, if
                    that was called for.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the Russian language training at the Foreign Service
                        Institute and your studies at Columbia University ended in June, 1962. How
                        did you get your orders to Moscow?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Again, there was the summer. We finished at Columbia in June, 1962 and
                    were due at the Embassy in Moscow in September, 1962. Well, at the Department of
                    State they told us that they didn't know what to do with us. Dick Funkhouser,
                    who had been with us the year before at FSI and faced a similar issue, found out
                    that the U. S. Army had a special “spy school,” if you will, as an extension of
                    its advanced language courses at Monterey, California. This special school was
                    located at Oberammergau, Germany. He found out that they didn't operate in
                    summer. So they had all of those wonderful professors there, with not a thing to
                    do. When asked, the Army said, “You-all come.” So the three of us from Columbia
                    followed in Dick's footsteps of the year before.</p>
                <p>Problem solved: we three went to Oberammergau for three months, with our
                    families. It was a beautiful setting. We attended classes from 8:00 AM until, I
                    think, 3:00 PM, or something like that. Meanwhile our wives and children enjoyed
                    the scenery of Bavaria. We had no formal classes but rather private lessons.
                    There was a “sea” of teachers up there, some of whom had fled very recently from
                    the Soviet Union. They were “real” contemporary Soviets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the record, can I humbly admit that I don't know where
                        this Army school at Oberammergau really is. Can you say where it is and what
                        its purpose is?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Oberammergau is near Garmisch-Partenkirchen in Bavaria, about 40 miles
                    south of Munich. The center is there to “process” refugees from the Soviet
                    Union, particularly military and intelligence types, to learn from them the most
                    recent intelligence information on what's going on in the Soviet Union. By
                    “intelligence,” I just mean “knowledge.” They would ask the refugees, “What's it
                    like on the farm? What were you doing, what do you think of the regime,” and
                    many other questions. It was run by U. S. Army intelligence, but I presume that
                    the other services had access to the product. It was basically gathering
                    “background” information. These people, men and women, had defected from the
                    Soviet Union. They were refugees and somehow had gotten across the Iron Curtain.
                    They were “picked up” by the U. S. Army and interrogated and, in some cases, put
                    on the faculty at this center. Some ended up as language tutors, but at the
                    advanced level. All of the U.S. military students were there for, I think, two
                    years. They start with zero knowledge of Russian. The Army gave us this summer
                    deal because the professors were available.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So Oberammergau is not only a refugee processing center.
                        It is also a language center for U. S. personnel.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes, but let me state it differently. It is not really a “refugee
                    processing center” in the sense that the INS (Immigration and Naturalization
                    Service) is involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is an intelligence processing center.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes. It involves bringing together refugees who possess military and
                    general intelligence. As you know, that can involve anything about the
                    contemporary USSR. It largely concerns “attitudinal” information. Army
                    intelligence personnel interrogated these people. That was the purpose of this
                    center. The Army's Russian language training school was part of it. I don't know
                    whether it began as that.</p>
                <p>As “teachers” for the three of us, they had no curriculum, no texts or the like.
                    I sat down with one of them. He said, “What can I now tell you about live in the
                    USSR?” Each of us had our own tutors.. The U.S. director of the Oberammergau
                    center would say, “This instructor has just arrived, and I think that she'll be
                    good at talking to you about life in Moscow.” They would do anything that you
                    asked them to do. I told them that I was going to the American Embassy in
                    Moscow, that it was my first assignment there, and that I would be Publications
                    Procurement Officer.</p>
                <p>I said to one of them, “Teach me the practical Russian—language and mannerisms I
                    need to survive and get the job done successfully.. He answered (in Russian.
                    None of them spoke any English): I will be rude to you”. I will be just like the
                    clerk that is going to be in the bookstore. I will be like the KGB [Soviet
                    intelligence] officer trailing you. Actually, that was my job before I defected.
                    I will do all these things to you.” He knew a great deal of “street” Russian and
                    the kind of Russian which, he said, “will turn their ears onto you.” And he
                    actually did that for most of those three months. Above all, this gave me
                    confidence that I could step off the plane in Moscow and really walk into that
                    situation. He told me story after story. He had lived in Moscow for a while and
                    in other places which I subsequently visited. He was able to show me what the
                    Soviet Union was really like, using his heart and tears. Yes, “tears.” He had
                    had to leave his family behind. He was a wonderful man. He would tell stories
                    about the realities of the Soviet Union. Back at the FSI and Columbia, the
                    teachers were great, but they were academics in their approach.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you remember any of the stories he told you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>MORGAN: Not specifically at the moment. He would tell me story after story—when
                    you walk along the street, when you get on a bus, when you walk into a store. He
                    would say, “Don't do this. Do that.” I am reflecting back on the full two years
                    of training: my year at the FSI and the year at Columbia when my wife and
                    children stayed back here in Washington. I rented a room in a house owned by a
                    Russian couple. I took Russian lessons from them and spoke only Russian with
                    them. But that Russian was, of course, “Czarist Russian,” because they had been
                    refugees from “White” Russia back in the 1920's. The Russian I spoke would make
                    my teacher at Oberammergau laugh his head off. He said, “They don't speak that
                    way any more. It sounds ridiculous the way you say it.” And then there were the
                    acronyms and special words used in contemporary, Soviet society. I learned them
                    from him, thank Heavens..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I asked that because before, when I was in the Soviet
                        Union, there were several stories that stuck in my mind. They were my first,
                        real life and personal impressions.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Well, you are younger and closer to that time [when you were in the
                    Soviet Union]. I am trying to remember what happened 25 or 30 years ago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you work with any of the refugees?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was strictly at the school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Well, the teachers at the school were all refugees. This man I have
                    spoken of was a refugee—or defector, if you wish. I use the word “refugee” to
                    mean someone who had “fled”, sought refuge from the Soviet Union for a variety
                    of reasons—political or personal or whatever. They were refugees in that
                    sense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever witness any of the interrogations or
                        debriefings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: No. You see, nothing was going on during the summer we were there. The
                    school was closed when we were there. The U.S. and most of the Soviets faculty
                    was on vacation. However, when they weren't on vacation, there they sat, with
                    absolutely nothing to do. The U. S. taxpayers—you and me—were paying their
                    salaries. The Army welcomed being able to put them to work. We could do anything
                    that we wanted to do, as long as we showed up with our mentor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you live off base?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes, just off base—about a quarter of a mile down the road. The Base was
                    in the country, not in a regular town. The hotel we lived in was a regular
                    Bavarian picturesque place. It even had nasturtiums hanging from each
                    balcony.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then orders came in. At what point did you know that you
                        were going to Moscow?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: I knew that from the very beginning. When I was assigned to Russian
                    language and area training, there was a whole “block” order issued, covering
                    everything, including the actual assignment to Moscow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did the Foreign Service wait from June until
                        September, 1962? You finished your language study at the Foreign Service
                        Institute and your training at Columbia in June.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: September, 1962 was when my predecessor, Herb Okun, was leaving Moscow.
                    We were all replacing other people, and we replaced them when they left Moscow.
                    I think that we probably “overlapped” for a short time. We got to Moscow in late
                    August, and Herb Okun left in early September. Also, there was the matter of
                    housing. You had to have a place to stay, so you had to get your predecessor out
                    of the apartment so you could move in, after a repainting job!.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: May we come to Moscow now? May I ask about your immediate
                        impressions of the Soviet Union, if you can remember them, on your first
                        arrival?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: First impressions, above all, I will never forget. My wife, children, and
                    I were met by the Embassy driver.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you fly in on a commercial flight?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Let me think. We flew from Munich to Vienna, then Aeroflot from Vienna to
                    Moscow, non-stop. About the only way you could get into Moscow in those days was
                    from Vienna. There was no Pan Am or any other commercial airline service
                    available. Maybe there was a flight available from Paris, but I can't remember
                    it.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>It was an afternoon flight. We got off the plane about 7:00 or 8:00 PM. It was a
                    Sunday night, as I remember. It had to be a Sunday night. It was dark by the
                    time we were through the formalities. I think that Peter Bridges from the
                    Embassy came to the airport and met us. We took the apartment for temporary
                    visitors in a part of the Embassy where the Marine Guards and the DCM lived.
                    There were four or five apartments like this when we first arrived. Peter
                    Bridges, his wife, and children were in the adjoining apartment. He brought us
                    up to our apartment and then brought us over to theirs for drinks and to meet
                    his wife, and kids-on-kids. At that point, after this nice, warm welcome, and
                    the feeling you get in the Foreign Service or any other organization, where
                    people take care of their colleagues, we looked out at the skies of Moscow. On
                    our way into Moscow we drove past the Kremlin and through Red Square. We had a
                    nice view of Moscow, which was lighted. There was a tremendous display of
                    fireworks. The skies were just filled with flares and sounds.. Well, it wasn't
                    for us, of course. Every Sunday night the Soviets have fireworks. So our first
                    arrival in Moscow was just fine. Q: Did you have any trouble going through
                    customs?</p>
                <p>MORGAN: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a diplomatic passport?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes. I don't remember any delays. I'm sure that if there had been any, I
                    would recall. If my wife were here, she would remember more particularly, I'm
                    sure. After what I had heard about the bureaucracy and the heaviness, I thought,
                    “My God, are we really in the Soviet Union?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did your children feel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: The kids couldn't have cared less. They were about 10 and 7 years old.
                    They wondered who their new friends would be and where their new school was. I
                    should have asked my son that question before I came here today. He should
                    remember those early days because a few weeks later we moved into our assigned
                    apartment. The very first word of Russian that he learned was “durok”, the
                    Russian word for “stupid” or “idiot,” as you know. That's what a Russian
                    “neighbor” kid said in the courtyard of the apartment building when he hit my
                    son over the head with a brick! I saw my son scraping up the stairs with blood
                    running down his face. He said that a Russian kid had called him “durok.” My son
                    asked its meaning; it was his first serious encounter with Soviet society.</p>
                <p>As new arrivals we were waiting for our Finnish maid to arrive and getting
                    ourselves together. Of course, I went to work at the Embassy. My wife was well
                    taken care of by other Embassy wives. She did the rounds and met people.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do we still have the same Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes, it's in the old building on Tchaikovsky Street..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a very nice building.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: That's a real joke. It's a dump! I mean, you're crowded. It's a small
                    place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's very crowded. When I visited the Embassy three years
                        ago, the space for the Visa Section was extremely crowded.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Very poor conditions. I think that it's changed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Soviets who were waiting for visas said that the
                        conditions are terrible.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: A few years ago the Soviet authorities dismissed all of the Russian
                    employees. So the Embassy until recently has had none of the support staff to
                    help us in communicating with and doing the staff work necessary to process the
                    visa applicants. Let me interrupt this train of thought to make a point clear.
                    I'm not sure how long this was the personnel policy before and after me, but
                    during my time in Moscow all junior and mid-level Foreign Service Officers who
                    had gone through the Russian language and area courses and were then assigned to
                    the Embassy in Moscow got, with very few exceptions, two different work
                    assignments during their tour.. They had one year in one Section and one year in
                    another. For most of us the first year was in the Administrative, Consular, or
                    Publications Procurement Section. I was in Publications Procurement. Then,
                    during the second year, you were assigned to the Political or Economic Sections,
                    depending on your background. My second year was spent in the Political Section.
                    If you went to Moscow as the Science Officer, a highly specialized assignment,
                    it was different. For example, Dick Funkhouser was the Economic Counselor during
                    his whole tour. If you were assigned as DCM, that's what you were. But most of
                    us had come into the Russian program at the junior or middle level and went to
                    Moscow as middle level officers. There was nobody below us. That was the
                    program, and I thought that I should make that clear.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. Where did you live and what kind of Embassy
                        regulations did you live under—from Personnel? And what kind of Soviet
                        regulations were you subject to?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>MORGAN: We had two main apartment houses some distance from the Embassy: at Sorok
                    pyat (45) Leninsky Prospekt, the one we were assigned to, and another similar
                    one whose name I forget. The Soviets assigned us the space, as they did all
                    foreigners living in Moscow. They were supposedly “new, modern buildings.”, but
                    that was all: “new”.</p>
                <p>Our building was a nine-story shaft, in the sense that it had one staircase up
                    the middle of our wing of this enormous U-shaped monster. Everyone on that
                    “shaft” was from the American Embassy, with the exception of maybe one or two
                    American correspondents. One of them was really a reputedly KGB “employee” named
                    Ed Stevens, who lived on one of the lower floors. There were two apartments on
                    each floor. Each family was there for two years, coincidentally with their tours
                    of duty. Our neighbors were the Perrys, Kirks, Semlers, Morans and others. We
                    were all good friends and neighbors. You better be under those
                    circumstances.</p>
                <p>Of course, there was a big, ever-alert guard at the entrance. Allegedly there to
                    protect us (from whom?), no one else could come in but us or other authorized
                    diplomats. Additionally, we had a so-called concierge on the ground floor. Since
                    she helped us in no way I presumed she was just the secondary line of defense to
                    make sure that we didn't do anything “unauthorized or unobserved”. Her main
                    function was to suffer our curses as we went by her whenever the elevator didn't
                    work—which was frequently. We lived on the ninth floor. It seemed that the
                    elevator never worked on what we called “commissary days” when the Embassy
                    Commissary received a shipment of milk, lettuce, and fresh vegetables, which
                    came in from Finland. That would be the day when we would come home with huge
                    cases of groceries which lasted a couple of weeks, at least. But the elevators
                    wouldn't work, due to “technical difficulties.”</p>
                <p>On our last day in Moscow, we were all ready to leave for good. Our kids and
                    suitcases were out at the elevator—and, of course, it didn't work. So down we
                    went, lugging our bags and baggage. Of course, now, there is a procedure to go
                    through on your way out. This was a happy moment. The concierge was there,
                    grinning. We said goodbye. I said that the elevator still wasn't working. I had
                    to giver her my last words in impeccable Russian: “You got to the moon, but you
                    can't even get an elevator to the ninth floor! So that was my farewell to the
                    USSR. Smell a little bit of paranoia?...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As an anecdote, you said that you had an American
                        correspondent in your building who was really a KGB agent?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes, reportedly</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What paper did he represent?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>MORGAN: He was one of the top correspondents. I think that he represented the AP
                    Associated Press, or perhaps it was a British paper.. We all suspected that he
                    was a KGB agent. There has been some discussion about this in recent months
                    about an American correspondent who was in Moscow for a number of years. He was
                    accused by “Time” magazine of being a KGB agent. Then came Warren Zimmermann's
                    (DCM at the time), and our Department's responses, in part, to that. Everyone
                    serving in Moscow gets a share of his information from people who are tied into
                    the KGB in some way. The KGB is one of the best sources of information. Does
                    that make you an “agent”? If you know about your source you make allowances for
                    it.We, in the Embassy, more or less knew who is what, though not always.</p>
                <p>Another news agency American was Shapiro who had been in Moscow for 30 or 40
                    years. He was considered reliable. How can you survive that? How can you be
                    tolerated in the Soviet Union and have that kind of knowledge—and not have some
                    sort or another of a connection with the KGB? But I think that Ed Stevens, by
                    the way, “alluded” that he was closely tied with the KGB. But an “agent,” using
                    KGB information, often was spreading “disinformation,” along with good
                    information. Such an agent is probably paid, just as the CIA (Central
                    Intelligence Agency) has people who are recruited to provide information and at
                    times disseminate some. However, Stevens, as I remember when I was in the
                    Political Section, was known as a source of potentially flawed information.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever have any social contact with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes. He was at cocktail parties I went to, and I saw him about our
                    apartment “shaft”. He was not a “friend” in any real sense. Also, correspondents
                    live a different life than diplomats do. They are always after different
                    stories, which ultimately appear in the media or publications. At the time I was
                    in Moscow the American community was very small. It was just about limited to
                    correspondents and diplomats. There was also a delightful American Catholic
                    priest whose position had been there since the time of Litvinov-Roosevelt
                    agreements in the early 1930's. There were no resident businessmen, apart from
                    an American Express representative. However, I think that even he was a Russian
                    national. I don't think that he was an American. So, we “fed” on each other—and
                    still do. Correspondents are marvelous sources of information.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell us a little bit more about the demographics
                        of the foreign community there and, in particular, the American community,
                        and their role?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>MORGAN: I can't give you the number of people in the foreign community. There
                    must have been about 50 or more full-fledged embassies. They were there for
                    their own reasons. The British, the French—the NATO embassies, if you will—were
                    there as normal embassies in the capital of an “enemy” country, the Soviet
                    Union. The Ambassadors of these NATO countries would get together and have
                    regular meetings. The people in the British, French, and Canadian Embassies were
                    probably our closest social and professional contacts. We got together for
                    cocktail parties and small dinners. They were small because our apartments were
                    small. You could get six or eight people in our dining room for dinner, and that
                    was it. You could have a “stand up” cocktail party or buffet, and there were an
                    awful lot of them. As a matter of fact—and I am now rather “picky” about it—that
                    was probably, believe it or not, one of the greatest pressures on us in those
                    two years in Moscow. This way of life meant going out an awful lot—for personal
                    and professional survival. Just to be able to talk to people. Also, you needed
                    to exchange information with people. You needed to tell stories, just plain old
                    stories about life. These social contacts provided a means to “let loose.” In a
                    very closed society, that is what you have to do. This is how you can be
                    human.</p>
                <p>Also, to get back to your question as to what it's like to live in the Soviet
                    Union, given Russian history and authoritarian realities. Some foreigners lived
                    there for a number of years. Some of them were really “bilingual” or even
                    “multilingual.” Press people would show up on these occasions, but it was
                    usually American Embassy functions within the Embassy or with other diplomats.
                    There were rarely Soviets who showed up, and if so, very “authorized”
                    bureaucrats. You rarely tried to invite Soviets to your house. The chances were
                    “zero” that they would show up. We had acceptances from Soviet acquaintances,
                    but practically never had the honor of their coming. Of course to Spaso House,
                    the Ambassador's residence was something different. But he also never was
                    certain who would arrive at the front door. We in attendance had fun guessing
                    who'd come to his affairs.</p>
                <p>My wife had one special experience. If I may diverge here, I will mention this
                    because it was to us a very special example of the realities of the Soviet
                    Union. I was on a trip to Central Asia shortly after President Kennedy was
                    assassinated in November, 1963. When I came back, my wife said that she had had
                    a phone call. She knew well that she had to be careful about her calls, which
                    might be harassing KGB calls to shake her up while I was absent. They are seldom
                    from friendly Russians who are calling to find out what the price of eggs is in
                    New York. Although Russians lived in other wings of this huge enclave of perhaps
                    200 apartments, some with more than one family to an apartment, they didn't dare
                    to contact you directly, unless authorized. You might look out the window, see a
                    funeral, and realize that one of them had died. However, you never had any
                    direct contact with ordinary Soviets. That was a near impossibility.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>My wife received one of these rare telephone calls. We knew that it had been
                    “taped,” as all of our phones were. The man concerned was a young Russian in
                    tears. he wanted to know how saddened he was by Kennedy's assassination and that
                    most Russians felt as he did. I came on the phone and he went on and on,
                    recalling how he and my wife had met and he wanted us to know how ashamed he was
                    of the Soviet control system and had been caught up in it when he had accepted a
                    dinner invitation to our house some months before.</p>
                <p>He had actually met my wife when I was away on a trip the previous summer. She
                    was out with the children at the diplomatic, or almost totally diplomatic beach
                    on the Moscow River, where the Soviets allowed us to swim. This man came up to
                    her as she was reading a James Bond novel. He started speaking to her in
                    English. It was most unusual in itself that such a contact would be made. It was
                    a beach scene, and there are no “barriers” around the area. However, ordinary
                    Soviets don't go there. If a Russian went there, he would be picked up by the
                    police. They would be interrogated and asked, “What are you doing?” Probably,
                    they would just be whisked away.</p>
                <p>So she was approached by this fellow who spoke quite good English. It ended up
                    that she gave him our telephone number. He called again, a few days later, while
                    I was still away. My wife said, “Come on over.” He said that he would like to
                    come over. When I returned to Moscow, we set up a date for him to drop in for a
                    drink and have dinner. I even called him back on the phone so that the Soviet
                    authorities would know about it and that it was totally on the up and up. He
                    said that he had been told that he could not accept but he had asked for
                    reconsideration. So we thought that he must be a KGB officer. We even arranged
                    to have him picked up by an American Embassy car. This was so above boarWe even
                    learned more about who he was—a writer of some sort. The bottom line of all of
                    this is that the driver went to pick him up, and there was no such address
                    whatsoever. The whole thing had vanished. It really upset my wife.</p>
                <p>Back to you question about the diplomatic community. While the most numerous ties
                    contacts were with representatives of the Scandinavian and NATO countries, we
                    also had contacts with the Indians, Indonesians, Arabs, and so on. Many of these
                    colleagues had their own special functions to perform. India's mission, for
                    example, had its special relations with the Soviets. The Arabs were something
                    else, but most had particular issues to pursue because of their geographical
                    proximity to the USSR and that they were largely Third-World, trying to maintain
                    a balance with the West and the Communist world.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>The African countries had “Lumumba University,” established by the Soviets to
                    teach the African people of newly free nations, how “evil” the capitalist
                    countries were, and particularly the United States, and how wonderful the Soviet
                    system was. These students went back to their own countries, fully trained in
                    Russian and in Russian techniques and ideology. These countries obviously had
                    somewhat different kinds of diplomatic missions than we did. Most of these
                    non-NATO and non-Western embassies were there to make sure that the Soviet Union
                    was not harming them but, rather, was giving them support. The Cuban mission
                    obviously had a very special relationship with the Soviets. Once in front of our
                    apartment there was a very dramatic, special parade. Groups were assembled by
                    bus loads to applauded Fidel Castro with great gusto. After he went by, calm
                    returned and away they went in the organized buses..</p>
                <p>I can't leave this story without telling you about the special “access” these
                    non-Western diplomats had to Soviet sources. Their apartments were often filled
                    with exceptional works of Russian art and pre-Revolutionary antiques. I remember
                    we were once invited by the Second Secretary of the Indonesian Embassy to come
                    to dinner. There were just my wife and I and he and his wife present. Very soon
                    after we arrived and had had drinks, he took us back to his spare bedroom. It
                    was covered, top to bottom, and all over the floor with magnificent, really
                    “genuine” 13th to 19th century Russian religious ikons. There were
                    paintings—forbidden paintings under the Soviet system—by contemporary,
                    “impressionist” Russian artists. They were “good buys”—very good buys. When you
                    left the Soviet Union, you could sell anything that you wanted—your car, for
                    example, and the kind of “junk” that you wanted to get rid of at a yard sale,
                    for example. Only embassy people came—from most of the Arab countries, India,
                    Indonesia, etc. They “swarmed” through our apartment. They took my clothes out
                    of the closets. They would give me almost any price I asked. They were prepared
                    to buy everything that we had, except that, obviously, we didn't want to sell
                    most of it. The Sudanese ambassador bought my beat-up old British Ford! So this
                    was one aspect of the “unique” nature of Moscow society among the Diplomatic
                    Corps. Q: Did you use the diplomatic community as a source of information, say
                    diplomats from the non-aligned countries, for example?</p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes, indeed. But they were very poorly informed. Most of what they had in
                    the way of basic political and economic information came from us. We were
                    trained, we were the experts, we were the major power. They knew that, even
                    though Moscow and Washington were at odds, what we were told and how we were
                    told it, was significant to them. It probably was useful to them. Now, how
                    reliable they were as sources of information to us was another question.. That
                    didn't mean that there were not well-informed, professional and intelligent
                    people among them. However, you had to be careful. Were they in the pay of the
                    KGB or even innocently passing on to us disinformation? The amount of useful,
                    reliable information which you could obtain from them was surprisingly limited.
                    Some, of course, had deep ties—family and other—into the Soviet society. Some
                    had lived there for years. Others had a abetter life in Moscow than in their own
                    countries.</p>

                    <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I should have asked this question before we began to
                        discuss your time in Moscow. Did you have any kind of special security
                        training before you went to Moscow—on how to behave, the KGB, and so
                        forth?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Oh, yes. “Training” probably is too formal a word. I don't remember that
                    there was any course which you attended for a week or so. We did have to go
                    through a security briefing given by SY (Office of Security). We were warned
                    that we would be followed and that the Soviets would try to get us to “defect.”
                    They talked about Soviet KGB “methodology”. But this was the kind of the thing
                    that you would have picked up anyway by reading the “Washington Post.” It wasn't
                    any particular kind of “inside” information. The security people, for example,
                    finally discovered the place where all of the tapping of the Embassy was done.
                    One day the “Seabees”...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What's a “Seabee”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: A “Seabee” is an engineering, plumbing, technical, or electronic
                    specialist from a Navy Construction Battalion on loan to the State Department
                    for construction work in the American Embassy in Moscow. The American Embassy
                    building had been built during the Stalin era. Stalin couldn't abide the fact
                    that our previous building had been practically under the Kremlin Wall. He
                    wanted to get us away from Red Square and gave us this building on the Ring
                    Road, Ulitsa Tchaikovsogo. It was reportedly “built” for us, but in fact was
                    constructed for VIP Soviet authorities. It was a nine story apartment type
                    building in a nice district between the Moscow River and the Kremlin, with a big
                    courtyard. It would have been a great residence for senior officials of the
                    Communist Party. Therefore, the building was already totally “bugged” with
                    electronic listening devices, since above all the KGB had to listen in on their
                    own leaders. From Stalin's point of view the building was perfect for us. It was
                    making Stalin's dream come true, because it got us out of Red Square and into a
                    well “surveyed” embassy. So in the late 1940's or early 1950's, I think it was,
                    the Embassy moved to the building on Tchaikovsky Street, which, as I said, was
                    all nicely “bugged.” We knew that. We knew that something was wrong. The
                    telephones in those days, as you probably know—they're more sophisticated
                    now—were a wonderful source of information for the Soviets, because the
                    telephone lines belonged to the Soviet Union. Their wires ran right down to your
                    desk, and the phones made wonderful “speakers.” Actually, the “speaker” was the
                    telephone itself, because the “vibrator” on the telephone takes your voice and
                    converts it into minuscule vibrations. If you send these vibrations into the
                    telephone wires, an electronic device can reconvert them into the words you
                    actually use. But they can't make elevators work effectively! It's a matter of
                    priorities.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>What we did was to “unplug” the telephones by installing a kind of “circuit
                    breaker” between the telephone instrument and the telephone wire. That broke the
                    circuit, so that the sounds that came through the telephone could not get easily
                    into the telephone lines, and the Soviets could no longer “tap” the telephones.
                    For a long time we had known that they were doing this and probably had other
                    tapping devises built into the building. We knew they were actively trying to
                    listen in to our conversations because you could see them doing it. I could look
                    out my office window and see on top of the adjoining building some but not all
                    of the equipment they were using. We knew what they were doing. Once in a while
                    we could see someone “fiddling around” with the machinery up there on top of the
                    roof.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember the church across the street from the
                        Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes, in the back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was told that the church was completely taken over by
                        the KGB.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Oh, I am sure of that. Also, the building across the street and in front
                    of the Embassy a big apartment/office building and obviously was being used by
                    the Internal Security Forces. What I'm getting at is that we knew that there was
                    an “inner” listening system, in our building, but we couldn't find it. The
                    Seabees came in while I was there. Behind my free standing, hot water radiator
                    they found the first evidence of where the listening devices of the “inner”
                    listening system were. They ripped out the radiator and went at it. What they
                    discovered was that behind the radiator, to make it harder to find the listening
                    device behind it, was a pinhole. The Seabees found it because the paint job
                    wasn't very good behind the radiator and they used “sound waves” beamed through
                    the whole Embassy wiring system. Out came the first metal, straw shaped device
                    about six inches long. That went into a total wiring system buried in the middle
                    of the walls throughout the entire Embassy. So the Seabees went through the
                    Embassy, ripping out entire walls and uncovering this system. But that story is
                    a long way from your question about security training I was given!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I asked you whether you had been warned and briefed about
                        security before you went to Moscow.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Well, we knew or learned things like that. We also knew that we were
                    being followed, we knew that the intention was to get me to “defect” to the
                    Soviets and tell them all my secrets—which I didn't have!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you ever “approached” by the KGB?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>MORGAN: Oh, yes. During my first year as a Publications Procurement
                    Officer...Shall I tell you now about the two jobs I had in the Embassy in
                    Moscow? Would that fit in now?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, why not describe your work, and then we can work
                        around to the security aspect. You started work in the Embassy in Moscow in
                        September, 1962, as a Publications Procurement Officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Right. There were two of us—Bob German and I. The briefings before I left
                    Washington were at the CIA, the Library of Congress, and so on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a briefing on how to do your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes. The job, publications procurement, was exactly that. I bought books
                    and periodicals. In those days—and from the beginning of our diplomatic
                    relations with the Soviet Union in the 1930's, through World War II, and since
                    then—the PPO job was probably the single most important source of intelligence
                    about the Soviet Union. (PPO is obviously the acronym.) This was because our
                    contacts with anti-Soviet agents and defectors in and from the Soviet Union were
                    limited. As you know, the entire world of the CIA and other such agencies is to
                    decide what is good intelligence, what is important, and what goes to the
                    President. What is decided on the basis of such information is another matter.
                    The Penkovsky Affair was the big spy/intelligence story of our time, or at least
                    my tour there. In fact, my colleague, Bob German, was accused of being involved
                    in that case. I'll get back to that later.</p>
                <p>The publications procurement job involves going out and buying a copy of every
                    new book that you could lay your hands on published in the Soviet Union,
                    “period”. We called this “WF,” a not so terribly secret acronym for the funds
                    given us by the CIA. It stood for the “Working Fund,” and the Soviets must have
                    known this. We had a delightful Russian national packer down in the Embassy
                    storage area. He would bundle up books for us, once a week, to be shipped out by
                    diplomatic pouch. He must have known the purpose of his labors and the source of
                    his salary, or should I say salaries. That's how we shipped the books out to 19
                    agencies, as I remember, in the U. S. Government. The principal customer was
                    “WF.” They (the CIA) paid all of the bills, then, back in Washington, the
                    various agencies would resettle the accounts. The second biggest customer was
                    the Library of Congress. The Library of Congress wanted a copy of every new
                    book, magazine, newspaper and map published in the Soviet Union, except novels!
                    They would scold me if I sent them a novel by mistake.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would it affect their color scheme?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>MORGAN: I would like to accept that as the rationale, but I don't think that was
                    the reason. Other customers included the Library of the State Department, the
                    Department of Defense, and other major U. S. Government agencies. I can't
                    remember which ones they were in those days, but agencies concerned with the
                    environment, education, and so forth. So all I had to do was to settle my
                    accounts a month later or so with the “Working Fund,” and then the other
                    Washington agencies settled the bills with “WF”.</p>
                <p>The actual modus operandi was that Bob German and I would divide up the Soviet
                    Union. We would make trips to every single republic and to Siberia. One or the
                    other of us were on the road, most of the time. Usually a given trip lasted for
                    about a week. We would go to the capitals of the various Soviet republics,
                    because we were pretty much restricted by the authorities from going anywhere
                    else. They wouldn't let us into smaller places—and certainly not to the more
                    interesting places. Leningrad was, thank Heavens, one of the exceptions.</p>
                <p>In Moscow, Bob or I went to Bookstore No. 1 every Monday. We had a marvelous
                    relationship with the lady there who ran the shop. She said to us once, “You
                    help me to fulfill my monthly quota!” She loved us. She set books aside for us,
                    as did many of the other, specialized bookstores in Moscow, and particularly the
                    Map Library. We had a special, and very good contract with the U.S. Army Map
                    Service. In turn, we had a special arrangement with the guy at the Map Store in
                    Moscow. He knew where his maps were going, but he could meet his quota with our
                    help. He would curse us for buying maps by the dozens to ship to “the enemy”,
                    but then grin an appreciation whenever Bob or I would go into his store, and Bob
                    or I would do quite often. The Map Store had a different name in Leningrad, now
                    St. Petersburg.</p>
                <p>However, in Moscow the principal outlet was Bookstore No. 1—I can't remember the
                    full name in Russian. When the bookstore lady got in a shipment of new books,
                    she always set aside one copy for us. I would arrive at the shop and go back to
                    her office. She would pull out of a cupboard stacks—sometimes 100 or several
                    hundred—new books. I would take every one of those books. In pencil, up in the
                    corner I would put 0, 5, 15, 100 or whatever. Mentally, I had to figure out
                    which of my “customers” wanted this particular book, and how many copies. What I
                    did was to turn to the back of the book, look at the “tirage”—number of copies
                    published—and thereby whether this was a relatively “rare” or limited
                    publication book.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The term is “the number of books in print.”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes. Then I had to be careful. If I took all 100 copies of the book, then
                    she would say, “I can't do that, because I have to provide this to this or that
                    other customer.” So you had to figure out how to settle this. Our “coup” the
                    book by a Soviet general—Sokolov, as I remember—on new Soviet nuclear power
                    strategy. Somehow, this book got through the distribution system and was
                    published. The U. S., military, and others at home, went wild about that one. We
                    bought about 300 copies of it over a period of time. It was “the” document used
                    by the U. S. military for years as “the Bible” as far as our relationship was
                    with the Soviets in terms of our nuclear power interface. That is just an
                    example. The Russians were very precise. They don't “lie” unless they have to,
                    for some ideological reason. They are proud of their scientific research, their
                    map making, and all of this. So we knew that what we were buying was pretty good
                    stuff—unless it was deliberately intended to mislead us.</p>
                <p>But that's the way we did our job. We marked the copies. Then the bookseller
                    might say, “Oh, I only have 10 copies. I don't have the 20 copies you want.”
                    Then she'd say, “Why do you want 20 copies? Who back there [in the United
                    States] wants 20 copies?” And she'd laugh. She couldn't care less.</p>
                <p>I would go to other bookstores, although less often, all over Moscow and the
                    Soviet Union. I went to Leningrad, probably every two months. Kiev we did every
                    two or three months. The Dom Knigi (House of Books) in Leningrad had the same
                    arrangement with us as Book Store No. 1, in Moscow. They loved to have us come,
                    and were even more friendly and less “heavy”. The farther you were from Moscow,
                    the more relaxed the booksellers were and the more they enjoyed it—with some
                    exceptions, and that's where the KGB came in. They knew what we were doing but
                    they didn't dare stop us. If they did, we could, although to a less effective
                    degree, pull down the curtains in the U. S. on them and make their purchasing of
                    U. S. books more difficult. I hope that they knew in their heart of hearts that
                    their information, which we were getting, was far more valuable than what they
                    could get out of public sources in the U. S.</p>
                <p>To go back to your question about the context and atmosphere of our trips during
                    my first year in Moscow as PPO, that was where Bob German was caught. “Caught”
                    is the wrong word, but that's what happened, in connection with the Penkovsky
                    story. Bob was publicly named as having been in a certain bookstore, taking
                    information from Penkovsky. It was in the newspapers as part of the material
                    bought up at Penkovsky's “trial,” at which Penkovsky was found guilty and
                    subsequently executed. I was not included as one of the “evil” Pops. We
                    concluded German was singled out in order to blacken or at least throw suspicion
                    on our book-buying and perhaps caution our book store helpers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For our readers, could you give us a brief overview of the
                        Penkovsky affair?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes. Penkovsky was a Soviet military officer who defected to us “inside”
                    the Soviet Union. Those who defect decide that they wish to associate themselves
                    with the United States or another country. Those who stay in their country are
                    the greatest sources of intelligence because they remain “plugged into” the
                    system. He was a Soviet Air Force officer, I believe, although I am not sure. It
                    doesn't matter. He was high enough up to have access to some very interesting
                    material at the time of the Cuban missile crisis in 1962. This relationship with
                    Penkovsky lasted over a period of years. Our Embassy doctor was an Air Force
                    officer. I don't think he was the CIA Chief of Station. Anyway, he was the
                    principal contact with Penkovsky, “under the lights and by the bridge” as was
                    reported in the Soviet press. The “doctor” was PNGed—declared Persona Non
                    Grata—and kicked out of the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>What the KGB caught Penkovsky on was passing information over a lengthy period of
                    time. But the most significant thing was that he—as I understand it, though not
                    from my own sources but from the newspapers—was the principal source for
                    information about Cuba over the years regarding what the Soviets were going to
                    do and how they were going to do it. This climaxed after the Cuban missile
                    crisis in 1962.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever meet him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: No. Good gracious, no American ever met him! That would be denied
                    categorically. Americans assigned to go to the “lamp post” may have met him,
                    but...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What does that mean, “go to the lamp post”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: That's where they exchanged information and money, the traditional—or at
                    least written in spy novels, and Pravda—way in which espionki (espionage agents)
                    do their business. They do it in a mail box, or by lamp poles, “under the bush,”
                    or something like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said that Bob German was approached by the KGB?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: No. Well, no more than I was, in terms of being roughed up by some huge
                    guy behind you. Harassment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us a little bit about the harassment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Well, middle of the night telephone calls. You're all set to go on a
                    trip, and it's canceled. You go to the train station to catch a train, and
                    you're not allowed to board it. Your permission has been canceled.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say “harassment by telephone,” what are we
                        talking about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Things like telephone calls at unusual hours and “heavy breathing.” We
                    used to get those at our apartment frequently, and in patterns. People would
                    come to our apartment.</p>
                <p>This story was not exactly harassment aimed at me, but I put it into the general
                    Soviet anti-US antics. I was called in the middle of the nigh by the Embassy
                    Duty Officer since I was on the Embassy fire team or its housing group. The
                    story given me was that the building was on fire. One of our Marine Guards, who
                    should have known better, had his replacement or a new Marine on duty for the
                    first night. The new Marine was brand new to Moscow and, poorly briefed,
                    assigned to burn the classified waste for the day. The place that you burned the
                    classified material was up in the Embassy building attic. The poor guy burned
                    the material in the wrong place. He actually started his fire next to the open
                    ventilation system of the entire Embassy. Flames and smoke were going through
                    the vents. Well, we had to call the police and finally called the fire
                    department. That's when I was called in. Several other officers of the Embassy
                    and I stood there, preventing the Fire Department from getting into where they
                    wanted to go, which was the Code Room. They kept insisting, “The fire is back
                    here on this level.” We kept saying, “It's upstairs! You can see it up there.
                    That's where the flames are.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You kept them from entering which building?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: We prevented the Soviet firemen and other “authorities” from going into
                    that part of the Embassy where the Code Room was, which is where they really
                    wanted to go. They used every ruse (I wonder where we got that word?) they could
                    to say that the fire was back there. They said, “That's where the water system
                    is.” We kept saying, “No, the fire is up in the attic.” And then the firemen
                    proceeded to put the fire out. I think that we could have as effectively put the
                    fire out. Of course, the Marine Guard involved was on the next plane out of the
                    Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was anyone in the Embassy, to the best of your knowledge,
                        ever “roughed up”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes, or poisoned, which was one of the principal ways of doing it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us about it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>MORGAN: Say you are on a trip. You have dinner. You always travel in pairs—like
                    nuns. Someone slips something into your food. When I say “poison,” it can be
                    anything. You wake up in the middle of the night and wish you were dead—in pain
                    and so forth. It never happened to me, but to several of those with me at the
                    time. My “misadventures” of that sort were in Eastern Europe. In Romania I had a
                    woman come into my shower to proposition me.. That's the closest I came to being
                    poisoned!</p>
                <p>I would say that almost every U. S. military officer, who traveled all the time,
                    has had an experience with poisoning or drugging. And often the whole party of
                    who were together, sometimes other NATO attach�s They were traveling in areas
                    that were very “questionable.” Their Soviet counterparts wanted to discourage
                    them from such trips, or just simple harassment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How can they be sure that it is “poisoning”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: You often can't be sure, which is why they the Soviets did it they way
                    they did..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What I meant was that when I was traveling in the Soviet
                        Union, I personally suffered from food poisoning several times.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: They know the way to do it! Or how about just plain bad food?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They got me that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: You don't know, nor did we always know. You often can't prove anything.
                    By the time they get to our own doctor, so that the contents of their stomach
                    can be analyzed, they're “clean”—they're purged. I don't know of anybody that
                    died in one of these “drugging: episodes. But the object is to intimidate and/or
                    ultimately to “get through” to you. They try to find out your weaknesses—whether
                    sexual, or you can't stand to be around mice, or whatever. They do their best to
                    “turn” you psychologically. Then, at the right time, they make the right offer
                    to you, or simple blackmail. I'm rather proud of saying that none of them ever
                    succeeded in “turning” a Foreign Service Officer, or at least in Moscow. The
                    “forces” did get through to one in Warsaw, using sex. Some of us didn't do as
                    well. After you read the latest “spy” novel, or even non-fiction, you wonder
                    whether the effort was worth all the resources that the KGB put in, particularly
                    when they profited so seldom their efforts. But then, every Ames is worth it to
                    them, as Penkovsky was to us..</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>In fact, the easiest target is one who is ideologically favorable to the Soviet
                    Union, or just needs the money. That happened in a number of cases in the 1930's
                    and 1940's, in the early days when communism seemed an attractive alternative to
                    capitalism. But usually, like the Ames case, it's a matter of money, sex, or
                    greed. Another motivation is that somebody is “mad” at his boss. The KGB would
                    work on that. They would come across such a fact, and use it. Or they would try
                    to trap your wife in some weakness or indiscretion; they would try to find
                    something that would cause you to “step over the line.”</p>
                <p>In most cases the harassment, including drugging, is intended to keep you “on
                    edge” and to let you know who's “in control, the boss.” Let you know whose
                    country you are in.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: The Soviet side was easy. The number one technique was to use travel

                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: You couldn't travel more than 25 kilometers, I think it was—or 40
                    kilometers outside of Moscow without Soviet permission. You couldn't travel to
                    certain areas at all—prohibited zones. A large part of Moscow and the “open
                    areas” were also off limits. You couldn't take a trip without the permission of
                    the UPDK (Uprovlenia po Diplomaticheskom Korpusom — Office of the Diplomatic
                    Corps), a branch of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but really run by the KGB.
                    So travel was a primary and specific means of control.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: You went first to one of our Foreign Service Nationals, Yelena, in our
                    personnel office. A charming, highly qualified FSN, who we understood to be a
                    Lt. Colonel in the KGB.. She would get you tickets to the Bolshoi ballet and
                    various special cultural programs. She would do all of these “wonderful” things
                    for you, like half a pint jar (you brought the jar) of Black Beluga caviar for
                    $25, or was it $15?. Only she could do them. You couldn't go down to the Bolshoi
                    Theater and buy, say, three tickets. I could try. Sometimes it worked but
                    usually it didn't, especially if the box office found out you were a diplomat.
                    She'd get tickets when nobody else could get tickets. So you used her. However,
                    incidentally, she also took all travel itineraries when she got the tickets.</p>

                <p>May I interrupt to tell a story. I was tutoring, doing some teaching, at the
                    fourth grade of my grammar school behind my house where I know live in
                    Alexandria, Virginia.. I had two Russian kids in the class—one from St.
                    Petersburg, and the other one from Moscow. The parents of both of them came to
                    the school for a “show and tell” night. One of the fathers came up to me and
                    chatted at great length. He was asking me about my time in Moscow. I mentioned
                    the UPDK. He said, “Ah, I was a junior diplomat in that office!” He said, “I
                    didn't like to be mean to you diplomats.. I thought it was terrible, but it was
                    my job. Today (at my job in the Russian Embassy in Washington) it is very hard
                    to stop being communist and authoritarian!” You don't just undo all your
                    previous life-style. His office is now in charge of commercial affairs.. He was
                    thinking of quitting the service and going into business as a capitalist travel
                    agent. But it's very hard to get that old way of doing things out of your
                    system.</p>
                <p>Yelena handled all of the travel for our Embassy officers. So you would give her
                    an itinerary. When I was the Publications Procurement Officer, I laid out the
                    travel plans myself. I didn't need permission from my superiors but I did send
                    my proposed trip to other offices in case there were any projects I might do for
                    others. We were supposed to “cover” the Soviet Union as well as possible. The
                    travel money came from other sources. It wasn't paid by the State Department, so
                    we didn't have to worry about funding authority as much as other Embassy
                    officers..</p>
                <p>I would give Yelena my itinerary. Then you would wait and wait. Usually, the day
                    before your scheduled departure she would phone and say, “Oh, Mr. Morgan, I'm
                    very happy to tell you that there is room for you on the train.” or at the
                    hotels. That was always the way she put it. Or, in the case of air travel, “We
                    found a plane that goes there!” What it meant was that you had permission to go.
                    Or sometimes she would say, “Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Morgan, there's no room left on
                    the train,” or, “Oh, Mr. Morgan, there's no plane that goes there!” That was the
                    way they handled it. Sometimes an hour before I was to leave, she would call and
                    say, “Oh, I made a terrible mistake! The train has been canceled.” So all of my
                    plans went out the window, in terms of getting out of Moscow to do part of my
                    job. It was very frustrating.</p>
                <p>The same procedures and results happened for all of the other offices in the
                    Embassy. So my next year in the political section our trips were subject to the
                    whims of the Soviet authorities. Only then I also was subject to the fiscal
                    strictures of the State Department.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>I mention travel controls as the primary harassment thrown at us. There was just
                    that idea of inefficiency mixed in with control over your daily lives. You
                    weren't in charge. They were. And then the idea that your phones were “tapped,”
                    or whatever you want to call it. The Soviets called it “regulations.” No way. It
                    meant simply, “We will keep our eyes on you.” There were purely Soviet
                    realities. For example, shopping for food on the local market. Although we used
                    our commissary and imported food, we did try the open markets for some things,
                    or just to get out and shop. My wife came back from the market one day with
                    four, wonderful pears. I asked, “How much did you pay for them?” She said, “I
                    paid $8 for these four.” I said, “Well, how much in rubles?” She said, “Well,
                    80; you divide by 10.” I said, “You don't divide by 10. It's the same thing as
                    $80 for those four pears.” But everyone had to suffer that, obviously most
                    Soviets. That was the system, I guess, not the regulations.</p>
                <p>Whenever they wanted to “get” you, or you were doing something which they didn't
                    consider proper, they would just “PNG” you—declare you “persona non grata.” If
                    you had “crossed the line” — their line—they would say, “You are engaging in
                    conduct not suitable for a diplomat.” That was always the term used. But I would
                    argue that many of those :PNGed were in retaliation (reciprocity?) for one we
                    had kicked out—for cause.The other half of your question concerned U. S.
                    Government controls or regulations on us. I never felt really “controlled.” I
                    never was told, “Do this or do that.” You were treated like an officer and a
                    gentleman, if you will, well-trained linguistically and in area studies, etc.
                    And everyone—all your bosses—treated you accordingly. Foy Kohler was my
                    Ambassador during almost all of this period. He knew the Soviet system. He had
                    been the head of the Voice of America. He knew what was expected of us. I never,
                    ever, felt that someone was “directing” me. I might go to my bosses for advice
                    and general instructions. I might say what had happened, or I would say that I
                    was going on a trip and was seeking “input” on what I should look for in such
                    and such a place or how best to undertake a project.</p>
                <p>The only way I can really answer your question on U. S. controls on me while I
                    was in the Soviet Union brings up a very interesting and fundamental question.
                    And this point came clearly to me as I've pulled together the Association of
                    Diplomatic Studies and Training “Reader” or “Collection” of oral history
                    interviews of fellow FSOs who have served in the Soviet Union. My impression
                    from the views of others is that I think that it is fair to say that there are
                    some with Soviet experience who might be considered as “soft” on the Soviets and
                    people who are “hard” on them. A new Ambassador or supervisor would arrive. He
                    would be looked at and, say, found to be very “rigid” and perhaps characterized
                    as “anti-Soviet.” These are extremes I am dealing with in using such words.
                    Obviously we were all more to the center and conversant with the complexities of
                    the world we were dealing with. What I'm trying to say is that some FSOs were
                    seen in terms of their over-all attitudes toward the USSR and Russia.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>For example, take Ambassador Mac Toon. I had a series of bad experiences with him
                    at an earlier stage, when he was my boss in the Political Section. We are
                    talking now about inter-relationships in the Embassy, “control,” mechanisms and
                    so forth. Mac just considered, in my view, that the Soviets were a bunch of
                    SOB's. His attitude was, “Don't be fooled by anything they do. Don't have
                    anything to do with the artists, don't have anything to do with other such
                    groups, because they don't have power.” Really, I think, that attitude came, not
                    so much from Mac's feelings about the Soviets as his impression that he was
                    mistreated and misunderstood in his position on power—especially when he was
                    Ambassador. We didn't serve together then at that later point.</p>
                <p>Subsequently and since he's retired, he has just gone on and on, at great length,
                    in the same vein. He was appointed the head of a presidential commission to look
                    into allegations that the Soviets had held American “prisoners of war” from
                    World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. He was on television and
                    radio a year or so ago. He came out with the same old stories. He said, “When I
                    served in Moscow, especially as Ambassador, they didn't relate to me, they
                    didn't share their information with me.” Well, of course they didn't. They had
                    other people, they had other ways of conveying information to U.S. authorities.
                    They didn't necessarily go through the American Ambassador in Moscow. So there
                    was that kind of “school.” You can call them “hard liners” or people who had
                    basically only bad experiences in the Soviet Union, who were “PNGed,” and who
                    had reason to feel the way they do. Maybe they are a little “right wing,” maybe
                    they are a little less “liberal,” if you will.</p>
                <p>And then there are others, like Peter Semler, my colleague at Columbia and in
                    Moscow, and a number of other officers, who knew and appreciated Soviet history
                    and culture. They had more of a place in their hearts for the “Russian” side of
                    things. I am exaggerating this in part, but there was that sort of feeling. I'm
                    giving you this more for the real answer to the issue of “control” over the
                    officers in our Embassy in Moscow I guess I'm sort of talking about “thought
                    control”!!</p>
                <p>Certain people were in positions of authority or influence, for example, military
                    attach�s, bosses in the Political Section, the Ambassador, or the Deputy Chief
                    of Mission. They would tend to react to what you had done—or not done. This
                    could have been advance guidance or after the fact. You might have your hands
                    “whacked” for having done something which the Ambassador, the DCM, or your boss
                    felt was “uninformed.” They might say, “You almost asked to be arrested. You put
                    the Embassy in a difficult position. Do you realize, Mr. Morgan, that the U.S.
                    Government has spent two years training you for service in the Soviet Union?
                    They've spent all of this money, and you're in a very important job. Now you're
                    about to be 'PNGed.' Do you realize that all of this effort is now 'down the
                    drain,' just because you did this stupid thing of walking up to this man on the
                    street corner and chatting with him?” Obviously, I'm making up a “speech-story”.
                    I wasn't PNGed. But there was that anxiety—especially felt by some of U. S.
                    military people assigned to the Embassy in Moscow. They were in the most
                    precarious position of being PNGed or doing something that State Department
                    officials questioned.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>The military were very daring and got themselves into very difficult positions.
                    That's why some of them were “poisoned” at dinner, and so on. And the Ambassador
                    would “go through the ceiling”—particularly with the military. Some of the
                    military would think, “Who the hell does he think he is? He's supposed to be the
                    American Ambassador. Why isn't he 'with' me on this?”</p>
                <p>I've heard many stories about Ambassador Llewellyn “Tommy” Thompson and
                    Ambassador George Kennan. They would say, perhaps, “Why did they 'blow' this
                    thing? They know what the Soviets are like. They know that they're impossible to
                    deal with rationally, in some ways. So deal with them as we know them. If you
                    don't, you're going to be 'PNGed.'” Or, “You're going to create serious problems
                    for the United States Government. In some cases just your being arrested or
                    beaten up might have tremendous bilateral significance. It could even result in
                    World War III, if you will.” That's what I'm trying to say in terms of U.S.
                    control by the Embassy over what you do.</p>
                <p>There was control. It was subtle control. It was a varied type of control. The
                    only explicit controls that I can think of was that any time you met with a
                    Soviet citizen, you were to report it to the Security Officer. That is security
                    control. Most of us didn't do this. For example, I was in touch with Soviet
                    citizens all the time. I wasn't going to prepare little memos about what the
                    Intourist guide said or did to me, or whatever. I think that, in Kathmandu,
                    Nepal, maybe, it's better to report something like this, but not in the Soviet
                    context, where it happened repeatedly. Of course we did report to various
                    elements in the Embassy, Security included, when we had something to say about
                    the contact and the setting in which it took place. Full trip reports were of
                    course made, but not to bookstores in MoscoThat's the only direct or technical
                    control that I can think of.</p>
                <p>However, as I said, there was all kinds of “ indirect guidance.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My impression is also that there was a requirement that
                        you travel with another American.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Oh, yes. That's another form of control. Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were your travel companions limited to Americans or could
                        it be with “good guys” people from friendly countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: You could, in certain circumstances, travel with “good guys.” I never
                    traveled with non-Americans, but I know that some of the U. S. military did. I
                    know that the American military often traveled with their Canadian counterparts,
                    because they all were traveling all the time. They couldn't afford to “wipe out”
                    their staff by requiring travel in pairs of Americans. However, it was largely
                    Canadians and British—but not French.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where would the U. S. military travel and why?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Any place and every place that they could get to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To collect intelligence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Oh, yes, or shall we call it information? That's the only reason that
                    they were there in Moscow. They were not there to work out bilateral agreements
                    with the Soviets or sell them arms, as we do in many other countries!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While we're on the subject, I think that it's a good time
                        to cover CIA's role at that time in Moscow.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes. CIA had what was called a small “Station” or group in Moscow. It
                    just wasn't something one talked about, especially in-country. You knew who they
                    were, in most cases. I don't think that I was ever surprised, because it was
                    such a small group. You knew that the Embassy doctor was from CIA, because of
                    the Penkovsky case. He was an Air Force doctor seconded to CIA. The Chief of
                    Station, also served as the Embassy Security Officer. He and I took Russian
                    language lessons together two times a week. The Russian teacher was there
                    throughout the time I was in Moscow. She would just “pick” at me. A new Chief of
                    Station arrived just before I left, Dick Stolz; a great guy who recently retired
                    from the CIA in a most senior position. I must tell you a side-bar at this
                    point. I mention his name because when he retired he did so with lots of
                    publicity. He was in charge of the clandestine, “black”, side of CIA operations
                    (the Directorate of Operations or DO). He was one of those mentioned concerning
                    the Ames case because of his position..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What does the “black” side mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Les, this is not an interview on the CIA. However, as is well publicized,
                    the Agency is basically divided into Intelligence Research (Directorate of
                    Intelligence) and Operations (Directorate of Operations). The “black” side is
                    the Operations side, the DO. Q: Does the Operations side include “covert
                    action”?</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes, covert action. The other people are analysts who analyze books and
                    other, written material, including reports from the field. Dick Stolz arrived
                    shortly before I left Moscow. We got to know each other right off. He said,
                    “Bill, you know, I've got to do some travel. I'd like to go to Leningrad. I
                    understand that you are going there on your final trip.” I said, “Sure, I'd be
                    glad to go with you.” We got permission from the Soviets, in the sense I
                    described above; that is, tickets etc. were available. We took off, and the
                    plane landed at Leningrad airport. The pilot was maneuvering on one of the
                    tarmacs. We were right in the middle of the main tarmac. We had landed and
                    turned around and were about to move to the arrival gate. The pilot stopped the
                    aircraft, right in the middle of the tarmac. Dick, sitting next to me, could see
                    a plane landing—coming down onto our tarmac. Dick was a very responsible,
                    level-headed person, with a lot of experience. He said, “Bill, isn't that plane
                    coming down where we are?” I said, “Yeah, it looks like it.” He said, “But you
                    don't seem concerned.” I said, “Oh, I guess I don't feel particularly troubled.”
                    Well, this other plane kept coming down, and he said, “It's going to hit us!” I
                    said, “It's a Soviet plane, and they can't afford to lose one.” So the plane
                    that had been about to land pulled up and flew right over us! Dick and I were
                    together in the Soviet Union for a month or so more. Every place we went he
                    would tell this story. He said, “Some day I will really understand the Soviets
                    when I know that they consider a plane more important than human lives or
                    because they can't afford to lose one.”</p>
                <p>The CIA had a very small Station in Moscow. It was in a very delicate situation.
                    Obviously, I didn't know what they were doing, because I didn't have any “need
                    to know.” You might wonder why they were the principal suppliers of the funds
                    for publications procurement and why they didn't have their own people doing it.
                    Well, they were indeed the biggest “consumers” of published Soviet material and
                    had been given responsibility in the Washington intelligence community to do
                    financial analysis on the Soviet economy, rather than leave it to their Station
                    in Moscow to do. Obviously, they also were recipients of State and Agricultural
                    Departments reports which did a lot of analysis All we had to do as Pops was to
                    buy and package the books we bought and send them to the various Washington
                    agencies. I should add that we also did periodicals but these we published
                    routinely through Soviet sources. This free and efficient “flow” of information
                    never became a problem; our office subscribed routinely along with Embassy
                    subscriptions. We always bought independently, and enthusiastically, periodicals
                    to which you couldn't subscribe, say from the Republic capitals and large
                    cities. Somehow, editors in the boonies seemed a bit freer, or perhaps naive,
                    what they published so you got some interesting insights into Soviet life in the
                    far-away places.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>When we would get back to the Embassy the books up on a shelf in the basement. We
                    had a shelf for “WF”, “LC,” (Library of Congress), Interior, State, etc.—and the
                    names of all the other agencies which received books from us. I would open up
                    the packages. Sometimes we'd only get half of the number I wanted.. The FSN
                    packer, who had enough knowledge of the letters of the English alphabet to pack
                    them, or keep them on the shelf if I indicated we needed to get some more :”to
                    meet our quota”. He understood that! Once a week—I think that it was every
                    Monday—Igor, or whatever his name was—would pack them up in bundles for shipment
                    in the diplomatic pouch..</p>
                <p>I don't think that I had to make any accounting for the books. In Washington they
                    took what they got, gratefully, and bills went out. Once in while I'd get a
                    cable or letter singling out some 'treasure” they particularly appreciated, or a
                    gentle “reminder/reprimand” if we strayed from target. (50 copies of “Gone with
                    the Wind”?)I only went to the Eastern European countries twice during my service
                    in Moscow to encourage and give guidance to the part-time PPO's. That's how I
                    got “approached in Bucharest!</p>
                <p>It wasn't a CIA “operation” at all. The CIA was just the principal “consumer” of
                    books and publications and the paymaster. However, the State Department would
                    “go wild” when they received some of these books. You can go to the Library of
                    the State Department today and find some of those books on the shelves there.
                    They continue to flow to the State Department—probably not as many books,
                    though. This program, during my time in Moscow, involved looking at virtually
                    every book that was published. To use that position as “cover” for a CIA agent
                    could have been very dangerous. It's very hard to do the PPO job, which is a
                    full-time one. Think what would have happened if that person's other job were
                    “blown.” What would happen to the PPO job? It would just stop. You don't walk
                    into that position easily. It was, traditionally, a Foreign Service job, and it
                    was a good one. You need to know Russian, you travel, and you get to know Moscow
                    and other cities as much as possible. We picked up our own “sense” of what was
                    going on. I would do reports for the Political, Economic and Military Sections
                    on things I had seen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While we're at it, could you tell me a little bit about
                        the Embassy itself? What was the staffing and what were your relations with
                        the people in the different parts of the Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: During the time I was a PPO, I the FSN who wrapped up the books. He had
                    some other functions as well, in Admin as I remember. I don't think that he was
                    really a KGB agent, the poor soul. But, God love him, he had a terrible case of
                    “B. O.” I had an American administrative assistant who would not go down to that
                    room when he was there. She could “smell” him.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>We also had a nicely equipped Embassy library, run by an FSN, under my
                    “guidance”; obviously me, I was the book man.. She told me one day that she had
                    been a colonel in the KGB. She'd been “demoted” and threatened with dismissal by
                    the KGB because she hadn't gotten enough information out of us. The Soviets were
                    going to demote her to captain, or something like that. She was in tears and
                    went on and on. She asked if I could do something. I think that her name was
                    Yelena. She asked, “Couldn't you give me some little, interesting things that I
                    can give to my bosses?” I told her to make up any stories she wanted. She
                    continued on her job in the library and I never heard anything more. I guess she
                    must have satisfied the KGB with U.S. “disinformation”.</p>
                <p>Then we had an Embassy wife who worked as our American part-time administrative
                    staff person who kept our books and did our travel vouchers. She worked with us
                    and helped downstairs, when “he” wasn't there..</p>
                <p>On paper (to the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs and on the diplomatic list) I
                    was assigned to the USIA operation. Officially, there was no USIS (United States
                    Information Service) operation (in the Embassy in Moscow). I did some of the
                    cultural exchange program work. The Soviets considered USIA as a propaganda
                    agency and would only accept USIS's work in Press and Cultural Exchanges. They
                    were aware that I also worked for USIA. Rocky Staples, Public Affairs Office and
                    in charge of the USIA operation, was my immediate boss. As one of my USIA
                    assignments, I took the Robert Shaw Chorale all over the Soviet Union—right in
                    the middle of the Cuban Missile Crisis, which was a fascinating story in itself.
                    I took professors from the University of Michigan down to Chechen Ingush
                    Autonomous Republic(s) which nobody ever heard of and never would have, except
                    that Chechnya happens to be in the newspapers these days.. Such escort
                    assignments gave added credence to my position. The Soviets liked it that way,
                    too. I think they thought Publications Procurement belonged better in Cultural
                    Affairs. We had a fairly “open” cultural exchanges program with the Soviets for
                    many years.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>Now on to my second year in Moscow: The Political Section had a Political
                    Counselor, with Internal and External Political Units. I served in the Internal
                    Political Unit. The officers assigned to that unit were the “Kremlin Wall”
                    watchers, so to speak, dealing with internal Soviet matters. The External Unit
                    was concerned with Soviet relations with third countries—such as Indonesia,
                    Cuba, and so forth. During my time in the Political Section the Political
                    Counselors were Dick Davies and then Malcolm (Mac) Toon. There were two senior
                    Political Officers under them as deputies and then a batch of Junior Officers.
                    These junior officers were Jack Matlock, Peter Bridges, Bill Luers, and myself,
                    under the boss, Ken Kerst, a U.S. Civil Service employee from INR (Bureau of
                    Intelligence Research) and a specialist in Soviet affairs. He was a wonderful
                    person and a superb boss. Going back in this interview when we talked about
                    bosses, I talked about Kerst as a sophisticated and human leader. He understood
                    all of the complexities about the Soviet Union. He knew how to deal with and
                    lead us as younger, inexperienced but learning FSOs. One of my colleagues, Peter
                    Bridges, followed the arts and the literary types. He had a real challenge; his
                    job was to talk to people that we weren't supposed to talk to, at least under
                    our boss's boss's directions. That's a throw away thought, but an excellent
                    example in my mind of how we did our job and under certain controls and
                    leadership pressures.</p>
                <p>The External Unit of the Political Section had, as I remember, a leader and two
                    FSOs at the mid-to junior levels as was I and my three colleagues in Internal.
                    They had area expertise, Africa and China/Vietnam. They all concentrated on
                    USSR-rest of the world relations and how they affected the U.S. This involved
                    such complex topics as Cuba, Vietnam, NATO, Disarmament, China, et al.</p>
                <p>Dick Funkhouser, fellow Russian language student from FSI, was the Economic
                    Counselor. Under him, we had an Agricultural Attach� from the U. S. Department
                    of Agriculture, with an assistant as well. Finally, in the Economic Section,
                    were Commercial and Science Officers and a State Department FSO Economic
                    Officer.</p>
                <p>The Administrative Section was relatively large. Jim Moran was the Administrative
                    Counselor. He was great, because he really knew what the administrative function
                    was all about and he also knew how to deal with people. He had a bunch of young
                    FSO's assigned to him. We had some Foreign Service Staff people, including a
                    Budget and Fiscal Officer and a Security Officer. We had a Personnel Officer who
                    was from the Staff Corps but also had Jack Perry, an FSO going through this
                    multi-assignment two year program. I would say that about half of the people in
                    the Administrative Section were Foreign Service Staff specialists and the other
                    half were on the first part of their tour as language and area FSOs. They went
                    to the Administrative Section instead of being Publications Procurement Officers
                    or working in the Consular Section.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>The Consular Section, was headed by Tom Fain, fellow language and area colleague;
                    he stayed in that position for two years. In those days the Consular Section was
                    busy and important. Not that it isn't always important, but it was a
                    particularly challenging job at the time. There were a lot of Americans who had
                    come to the Soviet Union in the 1920's and 1930's and had become Soviet citizens
                    but who now wanted to go home to the U. S., especially people from Soviet
                    Armenia. There was total Soviet control of all exits from the Soviet Union for
                    everybody. “Tourists” didn't exist. There were “official” visits, all tightly
                    controlled, all on a “quid pro quo” basis. For every Soviet scientist who
                    visited the U. S. you had an American scientist who could come to the Soviet
                    Union. The Soviets going to the U. S. were all well briefed on the “evils” to
                    anticipate in that capitalist country. Additionally, most Soviet travelers were
                    ineligible for an American visa since they were members of the Communist Party.
                    So it was necessary to obtain waivers from the U. S. Attorney General for these
                    Soviet scientists, for example, to get a visa to enter the U. S. In addition to
                    Tom Fain, Jack Matlock was the other Consular Officer there for my first
                    year.</p>
                <p>There were two officers and a very excellent, support staff of four or five
                    Russian FSNs. Excellent, but also KGB officers. Nevertheless, since there is
                    something absorbing and demanding about consular work, I sensed, and learned
                    from what my colleagues said and I could see, that maybe these Foreign Service
                    Nationals were quite proud of working at the American Embassy. Incidentally, the
                    Soviet authorities got more valuable information from then concerning those
                    wishing to leave the U.S., Soviet or American. We certainly knew that they
                    reported back to the KGB on anyone who came into the Consular Section. There
                    were problems, of course, with those affected by such information.</p>
                <p>There was an American Catholic priest who surfaced many years after his arrival
                    in the Soviet Union; most of the time he was in a prison in Siberia. We finally
                    got the Soviets to release him out solely because of a Civil Service employee
                    back in Washington in SOV (Soviet Affairs) in the State Department. She kept
                    after Embassy offices and in SOV to get him out. There were other
                    prisoners—people who had “vanished.” All of them were entitled to protection as
                    American citizens, except that the protection of Americans in the Soviet Union
                    is quite a limited, to put it mildly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When I visited the Soviet Union, I met a man who was
                        working as an electrician in the building where my company was located. He
                        was an American named John—I can't remember his last name. He had come over
                        to the Soviet Union in the 1920's. His parents had brought him over as a
                        child. He was “stuck” in the Soviet Union. The authorities wouldn't let him
                        out. Now he's 70 years old and can barely speak English.</hi>

                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>MORGAN: There were a lot of people like that, especially in Soviet Armenia. The
                    minute we went into a hotel restaurant in Yerevan, Armenia, we'd be surrounded
                    by all of these guys speaking Brooklyn English. They had been brought over to
                    the Soviet Union as kids and had grown up there. They were brought to the Soviet
                    Union by their parents for ideological reasons. Armenians, as you know, were
                    given a special welcome by the Soviets. But the family kept their English, and
                    their accents!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if you could tell us if you ever encountered or
                        can mention any first hand incident with American citizens or former
                        American citizens who were “kept” in the Soviet Union. Were there any
                        particular problems that we had to deal with or any “sticky” issues in this
                        connection?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Not at first hand, because I was not in the Consular Section. There were
                    stories I got at second hand and have forgotten them. These were traditional
                    cases, except for those which I became acquainted with when I was on the Soviet
                    desk in the Department on my next assignment. There was Virginia James, the
                    Civil Servant I mentioned above who worked for years there. It was part of her
                    “job” to take care of issues like this. Basically, she was involved in consular
                    “support” activity. Specifically, on this Catholic priest, I was on the Soviet
                    Desk and became aware that we needed an American “detained” in the Soviet Union
                    to exchange with a Soviet. I was involved in “exchanges” of “prisoners” when in
                    SOV and the U..S. had decided to return a Soviet citizen that the Soviets wanted
                    back and we had no problem releasing. As a quid pro quo, they would return an
                    American. So Virginia James said, “It's got to be Father So-and-So!” I don't
                    know how long it had been, but after 30 some years that this priest had been
                    held in the Soviet Union. She really, through her persistence, caused it to
                    happen. They probably thought that we were idiots to ask for a priest, but we
                    did.</p>
                <p>I don't have anything else to mention from my first year and in general about
                    Moscow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK, one last question about your days as a PPO. Can you
                        tell us what you really got out of it? What did you learn from being a
                        PPO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: I was able to travel and I got everything that goes with travel. I had
                    more freedom than most of my colleagues to get out and see Russians and other
                    people of Soviet nationality. I got to see the Soviet Union—every republic in
                    it. Central Asia will always have a special place in my heart. And that goes for
                    Siberia, Lake Baikal and the vastness of the frozen north. I will never forget
                    this experience. It's different. But you could get to hate it in some ways
                    because of the Soviet bureaucrats and general inefficiency of the system. You
                    always had these Intourist guides with you. They were generally “horrible”
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't think that you mentioned that you had to travel
                        with a guide as well.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>MORGAN: Well, I didn't exactly travel with a guide. I traveled with my companion
                    from the Embassy. However, once we got to our destination, we had to deal with
                    “Intourist,” the Soviet national travel agency, so called, to get a taxi or a
                    car, to take a local tour of the area, to get a service at the hotel, or to do
                    anything. They were at “your service”. Not that they were good at watching you
                    at all times. They didn't go with me to the bookstores. I would explain to the
                    Intourist guide that I was going to spend the day at bookstores. He or she would
                    say, “I don't understand why you do that. What a waste of time! I could go and
                    buy a book for you.” They did anything they could do to harass you, if you will,
                    or to find out what you really do when you're buying the books. He wanted to
                    know where the books would go. The Intourist guide would say, “Tell me, Gospodin
                    Morgan, exactly who are the customers.” I would say, “Come on, Sonya, or
                    whatever the guide's name was, don't be so dumb to ask such a straightforward
                    question.” Then I would think, “Oops, I shouldn't say that. I could get PNGed”
                    Under stress you could get so angry and frustrated that you might make an
                    “provocative” (they loved the word “provokatzy”) remark].</p>
                <p>Or you might have to bunk with three Soviet travelers who were completely drunk.
                    You couldn't sit at just any table in a restaurant. If just any Russian sat with
                    you, innocently or for the excitement of it, the Intourist guide, or maitre-d'
                    would say, “Oh, no, they really don't want you to sit with them”. Then we might
                    start a provokatzy!</p>
                <p>Or take the little lady, actually she was huge, fat and not really too lady-like,
                    that we in Odessa. This was when I was in the political section and I was
                    traveling with a USIA officer. We took a ship from Odessa to Sochi just North of
                    the border between the Russian and Georgian Republics. Or was it to Batumi in
                    Georgia?.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>We were having dinner one night in Odessa when this “lady” in question, and a
                    very young and attractive woman came over and sat down near us. Well, you know,
                    it was so obvious what happened that it became pathetic. They approached our
                    table and said, or at least the “trainer” did, that they wanted to practice
                    their English because they were learning it. The conversation, not to mention
                    the antics, became ridiculous. My traveling companion, Jerry Prehn, and I had a
                    couple of glasses of wine. About that time our inhibitions were lowering[. We
                    finally said to the two women, “Look, you've gotten about as much out of us as
                    you can. Go back and tell your bosses what you did. We will send you a letter of
                    recommendation, but please, enough is enough. You are being very amateurish and
                    doing a very poor job of picking us up.” The older woman said, “Oh, don't say
                    that! Look at this woman whom I am training. I'm trying to show her that I'm a
                    model person and I want to help you Americans.” So we said, “Enough,” paid our
                    bill, and walked up a hill, which was fairly steep, at a relatively fast pace,
                    to our hotel. After us came “Mamma” with her so-called “daughter.” I said to
                    Jerry, “Let's go a little faster.” So we did, and the poor lady just puffed in
                    defeat. They both also were wearing shoes with high heels, because they were
                    very “chic,” you know. They were very “kulturny”, you know. They finally
                    couldn't keep up with us. The older lady was puffing. We turned around and waved
                    goodbye. But they had tried!</p>
                <p>Experiences like that really don't add greatly to oral history but they meant a
                    lot to me at the time as revealing the realities of the USSR. I tell it to give
                    you an example of how we had always to be on the alert, to be careful. You know,
                    you didn't know whether that extra glass of wine or vodka would make you tell
                    them what you really thought of the internal security system. It “controlled”
                    you. That was their goal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's move on to your position as a Political
                        Officer working on the internal affairs of the Soviet Union, beginning in
                        September, 1963. Is that correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes, it sounds right. I had that job for a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us how your position was changed and why.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>MORGAN: The Embassy made such internal assignments. If you were a language and
                    area officer you weren't assigned to a specific job in Washington, just to
                    replace a person scheduled to leave. However, I knew that I was going first to
                    the PPO job, though I didn't know what I was going to do in the second year.
                    That second assignment was handled by the DCM and the Ambassador, probably about
                    half way through your first year, during which time they could see your
                    strengths and weaknesses. There were openings coming up in other parts of the
                    Embassy. There were openings coming up in the Economic or Political Section, in
                    most cases. It was a “sore point” if you didn't get moved up to one of those
                    positions. The officers were moved up were congratulated and you knew that you
                    had made it on that “promotion list,” which is silly. However, that's life in
                    any organization. There are certain jobs which are regarded as being “better”
                    and more interesting and “main track, substantive” than others. The Political
                    Section was one of those jobs. That spirit permeates the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>I was told that I was going to the “Internal Affairs Unit” of the Political
                    Section. There my responsibilities included reading newspapers, because you
                    couldn't meet anybody, except when you traveled, and then with difficulty. Even
                    then, there's only so much that you can talk about when you meet people. The
                    farther you got out of Moscow, the more people would talk to you. I went to
                    Central Asia. I could tell you story after story about people telling you how
                    they feel. But these times were rare.</p>
                <p>Dushanbe, capital of the Tajik Republic. was the locale of one of my favorite
                    stories. I think that Jack Perry and I were “fellow travelers”.. I remember
                    asking our waitress, a lovely and charming person in her 50's or 60's, where she
                    was from. Americans are usually initially identified as coming from Estonia,
                    Latvia, or Lithuania. The local people thought that we had to be Soviets and
                    certainly couldn't be Americans, because foreigners don't get to Dushanbe very
                    often. The Baltic States are considered “sophisticated” and well dressed, as we
                    appeared to the waitress.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>The farther away you get from Moscow, the more relaxed the local people are. This
                    woman was very pleased to talk to us. We told her a few stories in answer to her
                    many questions of what it was like “out there”. Most questions begin with, “Is
                    it true that...?” I noticed the meat skewers in our kebab that we were served
                    (the only entr�e) were interestingly made. I told her, “Do you know that I spent
                    an hour today at your market, trying to get some meat skewers? My wife would
                    love to get some real, Central Asian meat skewers. Do you know where I might buy
                    some?” This is before we were assigned to Beirut, where they have lots of
                    skewers. She said, “Oh, yes, I can go to the chef. I'm sure that he has some
                    skewers that he can sell you.” Shortly after that she reappeared very, very
                    upset, with the chef right behind her. He wanted to meet an American, because
                    she had obviously identified us.. He was great, and we had a nice, long chat. He
                    said, “I understand that you are having some trouble getting skewers. Here we
                    have a supply system which is insane, it's crazy, it's terrible.” Then he
                    reached for the plate, shook off the skewers, and said, “These are for you.” I
                    said, “How much?” He said, “Nothing! Do you think that I would charge you for
                    this? Take these skewers and good health to you!” I still have those skewers to
                    this day.</p>
                <p>Such are the long-lasting memories you preserve from traveling in the Soviet
                    Union. First, you learn about what people feel. That woman was in Dushanbe for
                    one, simple reason. She said, “I had to get out of Leningrad. It was too
                    controlled.” She said, “Out here I'm a waitress and I'm poor, but I'm free. I
                    can say things that I want to say.” She had been a professor of English, I
                    believe. Those are the kinds of things you learned. They are all fed into at
                    least a trip report and perhaps into a larger report on a more general topic.
                    You kept files. Other people in the Embassy might use them for something they
                    were writing about. They gave reports a certain amount of local flavor and
                    supporting examples.</p>
                <p>I will give you one other example. I read newspapers from all of the republics,
                    whenever we could lay our hands on them. I was responsible for military affairs,
                    a large part of the Soviet power structure, and struggles, education, and all
                    aspects of Soviet-American bilateral relations. We divided up the Soviet Union
                    among the three of us in the Internal Affairs Unit of the Political Section. As
                    I recall, I followed developments in Leningrad. I had been reading a biography
                    of Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev, who at the time was the leader of the Soviet
                    Union. It was one of those rare books which, I think, the PPO gave me. It was
                    relatively new. It was simple, pure, and unadulterated propaganda. However, I
                    found myself—as I was supposed to do—focusing on what might be new or little
                    known about him, as well as any between the lines insights into what made him
                    tick, or at least the author thought about him. After all, all leaders can be
                    succeeded. That's the kind of thing the Political Section does.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>I read other newspapers from Leningrad, including the “Vyechorka,.” slang in
                    Russian for the evening newspapers, which are published in most of the larger
                    cities. They are real “gossip sheets,” comparatively speaking. That's where you
                    can often find out what is really going on, or at least between the lines. They
                    are controlled by the Communist Party or the local government, of course. But
                    they also focus on movie and theater schedules and have a lot of local “goings
                    on,” the equivalent of Soviet gossip, less ponderous reporting. So I was reading
                    the “Vechernaya Leningrad.” It carried a letter to the editor from an leading
                    educator in the city. It didn't exactly complain, but you could read between the
                    lines. Whenever you read Soviet newspapers, you had to read between the lines,
                    of course. I looked for this “hint.” I gave it [the article] to one of my
                    colleagues, who said, “Well, you look for one word.: “odnaka”—”however”, in
                    English. There was extensive praise about Nikita Sergeyevich and how great a
                    leader he was. Then another paragraph began, “Odnaka”. That's when you start
                    reading carefully. In fact, that's the only reason you read the newspapers.
                    [Otherwise, you couldn't possibly get through all of the garbage that was
                    there.</p>
                <p>You look for the “counter arguments,” if you will, which begins with, “However.”
                    The article continued, “However, Nikita Sergeyevich is making a great mistake,”
                    or words to that effect—obviously not that strong—in his educational reform
                    program. But the article said things like, “Vice Minister So-and-So,” who was
                    Khrushchev's “follower, stooge” Khrushchev had really put forward this new
                    educational program. I mean it was a real reform, a masterful, “liberal” reform.
                    So I went in to my immediate boss, Ken Kurst and I said, “It might be that this
                    is a real complaint.” He agreed and said, “Draft a telegram.” And I did. I drew
                    some material from this book which I was reading and pulled it all together as a
                    sort of report due at an appointed time. As you know, that is what most
                    reporting is. It is not someone's immediate reaction to something. In reporting
                    from the Soviet Union it is mostly “think pieces” which have developed over a
                    period of time. This report was on education.</p>
                <p>Mac Toon, who was the Political Counselor and Ken's immediate boss, threw the
                    telegram back to me and put a note on it: “See me.” “Do you really believe this?
                    Do you really think that this is indicative of weakness in the Soviet
                    structure?” I said, “Well, I'm just reporting what I saw in this article,” and
                    how I had come to the conclusion I did. I was indeed my defensive self,
                    especially in front of strong-man Toon. These aren't the exact words that Mac
                    used with me, but he said, “If you insist, I suggest that you put it in an
                    Airgram,” a slow way by mail of getting words back and probably not read in
                    Washington, at least by the people in power. I went back to Ken and said, “I'm
                    not happy. I don't think this is right.” He said, “You know, Mac feels strongly
                    that he's not around to train you.” I said, “Then who trains me?” Ken answered,
                    “Well, he feels that he's above that.” I'll never forget that. Hopefully, I kept
                    that with me for the rest of my career. That is, you are there to train
                    subordinates, no matter who you are, the Ambassador or anyone else. Ken said,
                    “Well, Mac won't sign off on a telegram.”</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>That was in late August, early September, 1964, just before I was leaving. I had
                    the “pleasure,” one month or so later, at the most, while painting my fence on
                    Home Leave to hear on the radio that Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev had fallen.
                    You can imagine my reactions. Such silly things as, “if only I could have gotten
                    that draft telegram approved.” On the other hand, perhaps it shows you how
                    people react to bosses sometimes and way we run things.</p>
                <p>The final answer to your question about what the Political Section does or how I
                    functioned in it is that the highlight of that year was Khrushchev's political
                    decline and demise, and we didn't see it coming. The highlight of the previous
                    year, when I was PPO, was when we declared an embargo on Cuba. I was the only
                    foreign diplomat permitted to travel during that time. I was in Leningrad with
                    the Robert Shaw Chorale. I was assigned to be the escort for the group to a
                    number of cities in the Soviet Union—I think, five or six.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you tell us what the Robert Shaw Chorale is?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Robert Shaw is one of our great, American conductors. He was the
                    conductor of the Cleveland Symphony Orchestra at the time. He was subsequently
                    with the Atlanta Symphony. I think that he is retired now, or close to it. He
                    also established a choir, which he developed during the years when he conducted
                    symphony orchestras in various cities. His chorale was a group of about 50 or 60
                    singers. They are magnificent—probably the best in the United States. They came
                    to the Soviet Union under our Cultural Exchanges Program. I think they were the
                    first group of that size to come to the Soviet Union under that program. Among
                    other things they performed the Bach B Minor Mass which, of course, made people
                    fall apart when they heard it. That was on the program performed in Leningrad.
                    They also did a lot of American folk music, classical and religious choral work.
                    But the Bach B Minor Mass the peak of it all.</p>
                <p>I was with the Chorale for about weeks or longer—a long time—as “escort officer”,
                    which means the official, Embassy person who goes along to give them guidance
                    and support and solve problems if they arise. Goskoncert is the Soviet agency
                    responsible for all concerts and musical shows in the Soviet Union. It is in
                    charge of all the logistics and overall management of the tours.. We had a
                    delightful man from Goskoncert, who really ran the show, of course with the help
                    and arrangements of the local representatives. I was just a little American
                    Embassy presence and make sure the group was not “mislead” or got into any
                    serious troubles. Some called me their “Nanny”. I didn't actually do much except
                    keep Robert Shaw as sober as I could and the group from squabbling with each
                    other, as artists tend to do.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>A few of the members of the Chorale were of Russian ancestry or actually had
                    emigrated. They wanted to see the “motherland”. The Soviets loved the
                    performances. People stood in line for 24 hours at a time, waiting for tickets.
                    Often high Soviet and local society was present. The Russians appreciated the
                    beautiful music the Chorale performed and the simple fact that an American group
                    of such caliber was in the USSR.</p>
                <p>At the end of the program of Leningrad, the center of culture in the Soviet
                    Union, or at least the Leningraders thought so, there was a standing ovation
                    that lasted for 30 or more minutes. People would not sit down and would not stop
                    clapping. They were doing the Russian-style, synchronized clapping. Robert Shaw
                    was up there, bowing and getting all of the members of the Chorale to bow with
                    him. He was in tears. I was in tears every time I attended one of their
                    performances and watched the appreciated Soviet audience.</p>
                <p>MORGAN: In the middle of the Leningrad performance of the Robert Shaw Chorale, I
                    got a telephone call from Bob German, my deputy, at the Embassy. He said,
                    “There's a little something going on that I think you should know about, which
                    you can read about in the papers.” I said, “Well, I did look at 'Pravda.'” Bob
                    continued, “Well, actually, the United States has proclaimed a quarantine around
                    Cuba. All diplomats of every nation have been recalled to Moscow.” I said, “OK,
                    Bob, what do you want me to do?” He said, “What would you like to do?” I said,
                    “Well, I'll tell Bob Shaw. I don't know what his reaction will be, but I'd
                    prefer to stay with the Chorale. We still have a couple of performances. I'll
                    call you right back.”</p>
                <p>So I went to see Bob Shaw. He said, “That's too bad. If you're withdrawn, you can
                    tell the Embassy that I will not perform another note. I'm going to pack up the
                    Robert Shaw Chorale and leave for the United States. You can tell them that.” I
                    said, “Well, our Soviet hosts have to know about this.” There was this poor,
                    sweet old guy whom I told. He said, “You cannot do this!” He was a man of the
                    arts who genuinely seemed to love us very much. So he said, “I must make my
                    [phone] call.” So I said, “Go ahead and let me know.” He came back in a few
                    minutes and said, “Yes, it is true. My government has called all diplomats back
                    to Moscow.” I said, “What did they say?” He said, “They said that they would
                    make no exception for you.” Well, I said, you'd better find out because I'm
                    about to call my Embassy. After a short while my Soviet colleague came to be and
                    said that his authorities had said they would reconsider their decision. I
                    called Bob German back and said, “I've had a Soviet reply; I presume that you've
                    been doing something from your side.” He confirmed that the Ambassador had
                    called the Foreign Ministry, but it was unwilling to make any exceptions. I told
                    Bob that apparently, the Soviet authorities were having an internal
                    communications problem. Bob agreed but added that he understood that every
                    diplomat was back in Moscow, except me In about an hour Bob German called with
                    the words: “The Soviet Foreign Ministry has withdrawn their demand, you may stay
                    with the Robert Shaw Chorale, and they may continue with their program.”</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>Before and after this “mini crisis” Bob German and I had done a little “double
                    talk,” although I'm not sure how “double” it was. Bob's real message was, “keep
                    your eyes open.” He hoped that there would be no anti-American demonstrations or
                    activities because of the Cuban events. I said, “On the contrary, I think it is
                    the opposite.” I also understood him to be telling me to keep my eyes on the
                    Soviet ships in the Leningrad harbor. I knew that if the ships set sail, that
                    would indicate that there were some problems with the Soviets militarily
                    reacting to the Cuban missiles crisis. But our indications, apparently through
                    Penkovsky, were that the Soviets didn't intend to do anything. The Soviet ships
                    already en route to Cuba would reverse course and in fact honor the quarantine.
                    So I would reported to the Embassy over the next few days in “double talk” on
                    the location of Soviet Navy ships in Leningrad; they were not moving, nor was
                    there any anti-American demonstration. Nothing. All was incredibly calm.</p>
                <p>I thought about this later as I was reading a front page story in the “New York
                    Times.” It reported that I was the only American diplomat who had not returned
                    to Moscow, that the status of the program of the Robert Shaw Chorale was
                    probably indicative of the trend of events, and that the Soviet Union was not
                    about to do anything “inflammatory,” for whatever reasons.</p>
                <p>That happened in October, 1962, during my first year in Moscow. I'm giving you
                    that anecdote in response to your question about what happened when I was in the
                    Political Section. I said that I would have to go back in time to my PPO days
                    and tell you one of my best “political” tales: the “Cuban Missile events.”</p>
                <p>Against this background, the next dramatic bilateral event that took place
                    occurred when I was in fact in the Political Section. That was the assassination
                    of President Kennedy in November, 1963. I've already told you how my wife was
                    involved in that and how the Soviets really showed their grief. During the
                    actual assassination, we were at the Embassy “dacha” (country house), outside of
                    Moscow, a place where you could go to relax. The Ambassador had a “dacha,” and,
                    adjoining that, was a “dacha” for the rest of the Embassy staff and their
                    families. It had about 4 or 5 bedrooms We were there with Tom Fain and his wife
                    and were enjoying the evening very much.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>I had gone to bed. I was awakened by my wife who said that Jack Perry had just
                    called from the Embassy. The President was dead. He had been assassinated.
                    Ambassador Kohler had issued special instructions to everybody. Tom Fain and I
                    were part of “everybody,” and the Embassy knew that we were at the dacha. We
                    were told that, under no circumstances, were we to display any outward feelings
                    toward any Soviets about this incident—in the sense of who might have killed
                    President Kennedy, why he was killed, or anything else. Not that we would be
                    dealing with any Soviets, but this was an extraordinarily delicate time. I think
                    that Jack said this over the tapped phone for the obvious reasons since the
                    Soviets already were being seen by some as behind the assassination. Some people
                    at home were apparently saying this was done deliberately, and some were merely
                    speculating. When we got back to the Embassy, I remember Ambassador Foy Kohler
                    talking to us and to the American staff of the Embassy in general, about the
                    delicateness of the times. He said how final this was. There would be lots of
                    rumors and accusations and we were in the heart of the activity.</p>
                <p>In that context a couple of weeks later—maybe it was a couple of months—the DCM,
                    the Deputy Chief of Mission, Walter Stoessel, called me up to his office and
                    said, “Bill, I've just had a call from my counterpart over in the British
                    Embassy. The British had a 'walk-in,' a Soviet citizen, who says that he knows
                    who killed the President.” This man had defected from the KGB and was in the
                    British Embassy, seeking protection. The British had a Russian language officer
                    there to interview him, and they wanted someone from the American Embassy to be
                    present as well, for obvious reasons.</p>
                <p>Three hours later, after a very lengthy interview with this Soviet defector, the
                    British decided to release him. They said that they couldn't give him any kind
                    of protection there. They let him out the back door of the British Embassy so
                    that he could escape, if he were legitimate. Obviously, the fundamental question
                    which my British colleague and I were trying to determine was whether he was a
                    legitimate defector. The Soviet talked at length about Lee Harvey Oswald, and
                    his Soviet wife whom he said he knew well in Minsk. The defector was trying to
                    make the case that Oswald, and particularly his wife, were KGB agents. He said
                    that Oswald had killed President Kennedy on orders from the Soviet KGB. This was
                    pretty heavy stuff.</p>
                <p>I went back to the American Embassy and told Walter Stoessel what had happened.
                    Like a good boss, he said, “What do you think? Do you think he is telling the
                    truth?” I said, “Walter, I don't know. Frankly, my greatest concern was whether
                    I got every word right which the defector had said.” Here we were, talking to
                    somebody who was rattling away in Russian. I had agreed with the British Embassy
                    officer that he and I would sit down afterwards and talk it over, comparing
                    notes to make sure that we had the right verbs and nouns, etc., to see what we
                    were sure he said and to compare our conclusions.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>So we did this afterwards. As I remember, my British Embassy colleague and I
                    pretty much agreed that we couldn't conclude he was a “legitimate” defector or a
                    KGB “plant”. To carry out his defection the way he did certainly tilted our
                    opinion to the view that he was a “plant.” You can't get into any Embassy in
                    Moscow—British or American—without having to walk past Soviet guards. He came
                    into the British Embassy via a back entrance. But he was there and we did hear
                    what he said, but it was only his story, all verbal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what made you virtually certain that he actually knew
                        all of that much about the case? I think that the name of Oswald's wife was
                        Maria (Marina?).</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes, that was a question. I guess that we were more satisfied on that
                    matter. But then, again, he could have been “briefed” on how to do the whole
                    thing. So I sent off a report on the interview, through Walter Stoessel. We had
                    asked the State Department how this information should be submitted; to whom. It
                    wasn't really a “normal” Embassy report on the Soviet Union. It was somewhat
                    “privileged” information, concerning the assassination of President Kennedy. As
                    I remember, we were instructed to send it to the Warren Commission. It went out
                    as an Airgram.</p>
                <p>Nothing ever happened as a result of this report. I've been waiting to be called
                    since then. When I was Deputy Director of the Visa Office 15 years later, I got
                    a call from a person I had inspected in Mexico City. She was on the Mexican desk
                    in the State Department. She said, “I need your authorization for something.” So
                    I went over to her office. The subject was my Airgram on the interview with this
                    alleged Soviet KGB “defector”, which was in files sent to her from Mexico City
                    concerning Oswald's days in Mexico. The Warren Commission or post Warren
                    Commission phase keeps going on and on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was on the role of the KGB in Mexico?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Something like that. My Airgram surfaced, having obviously got to Embassy
                    Mexico City because it concerned Oswald. I think that there was a request for
                    material under the Freedom of Information Act or a Congressional inquiry. I had
                    to “sign off” on reducing the security classification I had put on the original
                    document. I had to agree that making this information public would not endanger
                    U.S. security, etc. I was so embarrassed to see this report after so many years.
                    I thought, “Did I write so poorly while in Moscow? This language is terrible!
                    Even the spelling is off. How did Walter Stoessel ever let me send this report
                    off?” That was my chief concern. My initial concern had been my Russian language
                    ability. My second concern was my English language ability in drafting the
                    report. Ego does play a part of our professional careers. I'm sure that the
                    document was released. That's the end of my Oswald story, and that piece of
                    history.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It might be a little beyond the scope of this interview,
                        but what would be the purpose of a Soviet “plant,” claiming that Oswald was
                        working for the KGB?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: That's a very good question. At the time, I'm sure that I had a detailed
                    answer to it. However, thinking about it now, perhaps the objective was to
                    create confusion, to mislead, and to test the British Embassy's handling of
                    “informants”. Perhaps they also were testing the American reaction. Those are a
                    few ideas which come off the top of my head. Because it wasn't an “authorized”
                    KGB operation—I'm assuming that it was a “plant—it had to be done by the KGB.
                    Remember that the KGB at that time, under Khrushchev, probably was more
                    “sensitive” to criticism. Probably, it was more “sensitive” to whatever role it
                    did play. We do know some things about Oswald and his wife and his connection
                    with the KGB, etc. “Disinformation” is often used to mislead or to try to
                    confuse you. You may recall from the days of World War II that there was a view
                    that we should “give the [Abwehr] highly detailed information so that Germany
                    would fall from the weight of this information, since they wouldn't know how to
                    file it all.” There is that consideration. However, finally, I don't know. It
                    may have been stupidity, and the Soviet Union was fond of intrigue and
                    complexity. Don't forget that a lot of the things they did were just “dumb.” Is
                    that enough for this interview?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Let's turn now to the post-Moscow period , which was
                        in the fall of 1964. Is that correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes. About September, 1964, the point when Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev
                    fell from power.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Routinely, in the sense that most of us in those days who had served in
                    the Embassy in Moscow were “lined up” for a job in INR (Bureau of Intelligence
                    Research), working on Soviet Affairs, a job in the USSR Exchanges of Persons
                    program, or the Soviet desk in the Bureau of European Affairs. Most of us went
                    to the latter, unless we were highly specialized, like a petroleum or science
                    officer or something like that—or came from some other place. But those of us
                    who were “trainees”, if you will, or were involved in a two-year language and
                    area studies assignment in Moscow, would go to one of those positions. I was
                    assigned to SOV (Office of Soviet Union Affairs).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us about the office and how it was set up. Some of
                        our readers may not be so familiar with the State Department. What exactly
                        is a “country desk”? You might think of people sitting around a table who
                        were the greatest experts in the world on a given subject.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>MORGAN: Well, we were. That's characteristic of the State Department. It still
                    has “tables of experts.” However, the real answer to your question is that the
                    Department of State, to put it very simply, is basically cut into two parts. One
                    is composed of “functional” bureaus, and the other is geographic bureaus. The
                    functional bureaus include consular, intelligence, economic, political-military,
                    administration, general services, and so on. Those are all “functional” areas.
                    They are big offices. They have “desks”, let's call them offices, where the
                    specialists of varying degrees work. They are a combination of Civil Service
                    employees and Foreign Service Officers and staff. The same is true of the
                    geographic bureaus, which have both civil service and Foreign Service Officers.
                    They are very much intermingled. However, the functional bureaus largely deal
                    with their [particular] function. The Consular Bureau, for example, has to carry
                    out the laws dealing with consular affairs—visas, the protection of Americans
                    [overseas], and passports.</p>
                <p>The geographic bureaus cover the world, which is broken down into geographic
                    areas: Europe and Canada, East Asia, South Asia, the Near East and North Africa,
                    South of the Sahara Africa, and Latin America. Those are the geographic bureaus.
                    Within each one of these geographic bureaus are subordinate offices, sometimes
                    called desks if the office is confined to one country.. SOV is part of the
                    Bureau of European Affairs, although it also covers that part of the former
                    Soviet Union, now mostly Russia, which extends into Asia. In fact,
                    responsibility for Moscow is assigned to the European Bureau. Canada was under
                    the European Bureau, but finally, the Canadians “got their independence” and the
                    Bureau of European Affairs became the Bureau of European and Canadian Affairs.
                    Within the European Bureau there are many desks. SOV had about 12 officers
                    assigned there, plus eight or so support staff, including secretaries and
                    clerical help. We focused on the Soviet Union, which in turn was broken down
                    into three parts within the Office of Soviet Affairs. First was Soviet Bilateral
                    Affairs, to which I was assigned. It dealt only with U.S.-U.S.S.R. relations in
                    all of their dimensions. Another section was Soviet Multilateral Affairs, which
                    dealt with U.S.S.R.-third country or international organizations such as NATO,
                    UN affairs and how they affected the U.S. interests. Soviet-U.S. economic issues
                    was the third element of SOV and was a very small office consisting of two or
                    three officers. This is not to be confused with the Economic Bureau of the
                    Department!. Yes, they all worked together, but this was a specialized area
                    within SOV, the Soviet “desk.” It focused largely on Soviet agricultural and
                    economic affairs. In my Soviet Bilateral Affairs section I was deputy to Carroll
                    Woods, the director. We had two other, more junior officers, neither of whom had
                    served in the Soviet Union. Also was Virginia James, about whom I spoke above
                    and, as a Civil Service employee, had served in SOV for many, many years. She
                    largely followed issues with a need for continuity, like people in jail, for
                    example.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>In turn, to go on with your question, we divided responsibility for specific
                    aspects of our bilateral relations among the three or four officers in SOV.
                    Carroll Woods, as the Office Director, was involved in all of issues and some
                    topics he was especially interested or qualified in. As one of the three Office
                    Directors in SOV, he reported to the head of the Soviet “desk,” who was, my
                    first year, David Henry. Mac Toon succeeded him. There was also a Deputy
                    Director. They took care of the larger problems that related to the Soviet
                    Union, many of which started with us subordinates or at least were tracked on a
                    routine basis until they escalated to the bosses, including the White House. I
                    have read with great interest of recent efforts to “de-layer”—remove supervisory
                    personnel—the bureaucracy. It's not easy, as you naturally report through your
                    own channels to bosses of more authority, and hopefully more skills and
                    knowledge. There were numerous such layers at that time. Nevertheless, I
                    reported to Carroll Woods, period. Once in a while I would find myself taking
                    guidance or direction directly from Toon or Henry or even from an Assistant
                    Secretary of State—although that was most extraordinary. The structure was very
                    “layered.”</p>
                <p>Finally, there were my specific “areas of competence”, as we called them. Whether
                    I was really “competent” or not didn't matter; the desk called them that. They
                    included maritime, military and general consular affairs. I also followed the
                    activities of those “spying” Soviet diplomats as they maneuvered around our
                    society. I looked into such things as violations of their travel status. Another
                    responsibility of mine was the control of travel by Soviet diplomats in the U.
                    S.. This was a result of the Soviets' restricting our travel and access the
                    Soviet Union. I did the same thing against them, in “retaliation”. I made sure
                    that in the case of any diplomatic note which came from the Soviet Embassy to
                    the State Department, advising of the travel plans of Soviet diplomats, that the
                    local authorities in whatever state knew that they were coming there and what
                    they were coming for. And I “made note of” and advised them in writing when they
                    violated the approved itinerary. That was a “black mark” against them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that I remember hearing that even until recently
                        cities like St. Louis, Seattle, and other places that either had military
                        installations or buildings with military significance, like the Boeing
                        Company or McDonnell-Douglas aircraft factories, were “off limits” to Soviet
                        diplomats.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: I don't know specifically that those areas were “off limits” but let me
                    use the case of the Boeing factory, because I think that it is a very good
                    example of the difficulties of U. S. relations with the U. S. S. R. Certainly,
                    this was the case in those days and up until the fall of the Berlin Wall,
                    communism, and the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do these restrictions continue today?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes, every nation has the right and obligation to guard its own national
                    secrets. So if you have a naval base or an air force base, you “close” it. You
                    “close” it also to Americans in that sense. I'm sure that today there still are
                    special rules about keeping Russians or Poles or French or Canadians away from
                    certain installations. They may be still today applied on the basis of
                    reciprocity; I just don't know. Remember, there are two considerations here. We
                    and the Soviets had the “need” to protect certain facilities. At the same time,
                    some of the effort we exerted to keep the Soviets away from some installations
                    was sheer “pressure” on them to give up their control on our diplomats in areas
                    which, as far as we were concerned, should have been “wide open.” There was no
                    military interest in them at all. They just wanted to control us. I underscore
                    that.</p>
                <p>When the Soviets first applied a travel restriction on us—I should remember the
                    date, but I do not—they started saying that you cannot go beyond a 40 kilometer
                    (25 mile) circle of certain areas in the Soviet Union, Moscow for instance. You
                    cannot travel to these areas. You must get permission to go any place else in
                    the Soviet Union. There were certain areas which, by definition, were “closed.”
                    You needed special permission to go there. Other areas were “open,” but you
                    still had to get specific permission to travel there. All of that was a bore and
                    a symbol of authoritarian controls by a totalitarian state of the worst sort. It
                    was a symbol of a bureaucracy which had run “amuck.” I can assure you that an
                    awful lot of these restrictions were cases of bureaucracy at its worst. It
                    wasn't really that the Soviets wanted unnecessarily to harass us, although they
                    enjoyed doing that very much. It wasn't to keep secrets. It was just the
                    bureaucracy. This kept a lot of people very, very busy, watching where we were
                    going and then turning over to the KGB all of this information so that they
                    could follow us.</p>
                <p>Obviously, the first purpose of these controls was to preserve secrecy, but it
                    was also just to keep the system going. This was like winning World War II by
                    inundating the Germans with too many documents. I think that the Soviet Union,
                    in part, fell because of the heavy and inefficient bureaucracy—just plain
                    inefficiency.</p>
                <p>Seriously, though, those are some of the things I did on the Soviet desk for my
                    two years there (1964-66). I had to follow where the Soviets went, constantly
                    reminding them that we were not going to harass them. We did it largely to
                    convince them that their excessive travel controls was a system which they
                    should abandon. Of course, both sides had to protect those areas which were
                    highly sensitive for military or other truly sensitive reasons. Remember that
                    the Soviets thought that some of the areas which were “sensitive” were
                    non-military in character or were “sensitive” for non-military reasons. They
                    were embarrassed—or there were problems there that they wished to keep from
                    foreigners, or often from their own citizens. There may have been internal
                    issues, not that a revolution was under way, but there were a lot of reasons to
                    keep us out. They didn't want us to see certain areas, lest they be shown to be
                    not up to standard, etc.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>What we did was constantly work at them and remind them that, “Yes, you must ask
                    permission to go to St. Louis. It's a wide open and wonderful city. The only
                    reason that we are doing this is in reciprocity for what you have done to our
                    Embassy people in the Soviet Union.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you tell us exactly how you would do that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes. We did the exact same thing they did. Doesn't that sound awful.
                    Every time that travel was scheduled to a university, a meeting, a lecture, or
                    any other purpose Soviet diplomats in the U. S. were required to send us a
                    diplomatic note with a schedule of the proposed trip. I would get the note and
                    copies of the note would go out to the areas concerned and to U.S. government
                    concerned agencies. If a Soviet diplomat were going to visit the University of
                    California to make a speech on this or that subject, they had to put down the
                    specific reason, the date, the method of transportation, and so on. This
                    schedule was turned over to the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation), the
                    University of California, and the local authorities (in California), so that
                    they knew who was coming and what the purpose was. We would also confirm the
                    schedule with the sponsoring group. Of course, under an agreement with the
                    United Nations, anyone going to New York could not be restricted. However, we
                    insisted on knowing when they were going and what the circumstances were.</p>
                <p>If the purpose of the travel was in connection with a controversial meeting of
                    some sort and the press had already learned of it, or there were groups opposed
                    to that Soviet official going there, we might double check the circumstances and
                    ramifications of the travel]. Sometimes I found myself caught between groups
                    that wanted a Soviet representative at a meeting and groups which did not want
                    him there. Going back to your question about the aviation industry—a visit to
                    the Boeing Aircraft factory in Seattle and so on—not all U. S. Government
                    agencies were in agreement on how to handle such a matter. CIA might want one
                    thing, the FBI might want something different, and the U. S. military might want
                    something still different—or had different inputs into the reasons for making
                    certain areas “out of bounds” for travel by Soviet diplomats. Some of the
                    proposed travel resulted in long, inter-agency battles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you “walk us through” one such controversial case that
                        you can remember—that really takes us through the decision-making
                        process?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>MORGAN: Well, as you can imagine, picking a specific case out of my memory is not
                    easy, but let me walk you through the process. Then I'll either come up with one
                    example and/or give you a typical case. First of all, not every single request
                    for travel requires the approval of a huge “sea” of bureaucrats. Most of these
                    requests were very, very routine and were approved without difficulty. Let's
                    take first the case where only the State Department was concerned. That would
                    involve reciprocity. We would have reason, because of a very bad case recently
                    in Moscow, where the Defense Attach� ran into one of these very difficult
                    situations in connection with, for example, a proposed visit of his to
                    Vladivostok. We wished to retaliate. So our comparable “reciprocity” in this
                    case would be to delay action on the next application by a Soviet diplomat to
                    visit some place in the United States. This request might involve the simplest,
                    most acceptable, proposed visit in the world. However, it well might involve an
                    application for permission to travel by a man of relatively the same rank as our
                    man in Moscow who had been denied permission to travel. In other words, we would
                    try to find a case as similar as we could find. We usually we make no reference
                    to the case in Moscow, at least by name, etc. That was our way of showing that
                    we disapproved of the way the Soviets had handled a comparable case in the
                    Soviet Union. But the Soviets knew, of course. In such cases the State
                    Department acted on its own authority, in retaliation. Reciprocity is the word
                    we would use. To say it today, thirty years later and post-USSR, it sounds a bit
                    childish. But we were convinced at the time it was an essential quid pro quo to
                    get the Soviets to make changes in their system, if they wanted to “play with
                    the big boys”.</p>
                <p>Take another case involving the State Department and other U. S. Government
                    agencies, but not in the intelligence community. Let's say that St. Louis
                    University had invited some Soviet scientists to go out to St. Louis, as well as
                    the Science Officer in the Soviet Embassy in Washington to join them. The Soviet
                    scientists would come under the exchanges program. That would have been approved
                    ahead of time—their itinerary, and so forth. Their visit came under my
                    counterpart in the US-USSR Exchanges office. The Soviet scientists were in
                    exchange for a comparable program of scientists from the U.S. going to the
                    Soviet Union.. Both itineraries, their programs, and their leaders were all
                    agreed to in advance, and visa applications submitted and approved, or turned
                    down. My office was not directly, “operationally” involved, although both of us
                    in the State Department went through the same process of U.S. clearance.</p>
                <p>Now we have the case of the Science Officer of the Soviet Embassy wanting to join
                    in at the program at the university. The embassy officer has received some
                    previous bad local publicity. This all results in a tremendous, local brouhaha.
                    The White House and several Members of Congress have gotten involved. There are
                    various groups taking pro and con positions. We would find ourselves at the
                    State Department—and this is something like approving a visa, if you
                    will—working at this issue from the political point of view. Is it in the U. S.
                    national interest to have this issue go one way or the other? The Secretary of
                    State—and maybe the President—would have to decide. Many of these questions
                    reach the very highest level. An issue like this is not an intelligence one, but
                    a policy question, including the integrity of the Exchanges Agreement.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Exactly how was that decision made? When you received such
                        a request for permission for the Science Officer of the Soviet Embassy to
                        attend a meeting, what did you do with it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: I “worked” the Science Officer's diplomatic note. I knew the purpose of
                    his visit and the opposing views. I'd wrap the elements of the case into a
                    “Decision Memo”, get clearances from all those with differing views, largely in
                    the Department and then start the paper “upward”. I would probably make a
                    recommendation. Cases like the one above were settled in the State Department,
                    probably at the Assistant Secretary Level or maybe just by the Soviet desk. In
                    some cases a functional bureau, say, the Consular Bureau, if a visa were
                    involved, or the Economic, Science, or Energy Bureaus on other issues might have
                    a strong “vote” in the decision. But most discussions largely focused —were
                    worked— on the geographic desk. This was not just the case with the Soviet desk.
                    Whenever there are issues that need to be decided, reconciled, they always end
                    up on the geographic desk. If they can't be settled at a lower level by the
                    desk, in consultation with other parties, they go up to the level of the
                    Assistant Secretary. From there, they may go up to the Secretary of State or
                    even the White House—the “Seat of Authority” of Power. That's the route
                    involved, to answer your question as to how you get a request approved or
                    disapproved.</p>
                <p>If the Secretary of State should approve the request and another agency such as
                    the ABC (Atomic Energy Commission—now Nuclear Regulatory Commission)—didn't like
                    that decision, it can appeal to the President. And that's what it does. Then
                    there is Congress, of course. Let's not forget that members of the House of
                    Representatives and the Senate are involved in such issues all the time, usually
                    because there is a constituent who has expressed himself one way or the other,
                    or because there is a Congressman whose area of competence causes him to get
                    involved.</p>
                <p>What you're getting at is the more routine, clearance procedure needed for
                    national security related issues. All of those others were basically “political”
                    issues, in which the State Department is primarily involved in U.S.-U.S.S.R.
                    bilateral relations. However, a decision may involve other areas, such as a
                    military base or a KGB agent who is off “spying” or “ensnaring”. That was also
                    my area of “expertise.” We pretty much knew who was who. We kept a little book
                    listing who was and who wasn't a KGB agent. Of course, no government agency
                    would say, “So and so is a KGB agent.” The phraseology would always be, “He is
                    believed to be a KGB or GRU (military intelligence) agent.” I would say that a
                    good 50% of the people assigned to the Soviet Embassy in Washington were KGB
                    agents. But the distinction between diplomats who were employed by that agency
                    or other Soviet agencies, as far as security is concerned, is moot.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>Remember, they had no “local American” staff—no equivalent of the Foreign Service
                    National staff. They were all Soviet citizens. Many of them at the theoretically
                    “lower” levels, in fact, were intelligence operatives. Other officials in the
                    Embassy often took their directions from them. KGB officials often had the
                    “cover” of “First Secretary for so and so.” The senior officer of the KGB was
                    known as the “Rezidyent,” and most in the Soviet Embassy knew who he was. I
                    think that he “passed” semi-officially as “Rezidyent.” Beyond that, other agents
                    were sort of “buried” in the Consular Section or other parts of the Embassy. The
                    Soviet Ambassador's chauffeur was probably at least a colonel in the KGB. Then
                    other Soviet citizens holding various jobs, such as journalists were also
                    considered to be, if not under the control of the KGB, certainly under its
                    influence. At the Embassy, too, those not employed directly by the KGB might be
                    real Soviet Foreign Office people. However, they walked a very careful line. The
                    Ambassador was not a KGB officer, but he listened carefully to the
                    Rezidyent.</p>
                <p>The other intelligence group was the GRU, the military intelligence organization.
                    They were a large group but they focused on military questions, just as in
                    Moscow we had a large, military attach� office. The people in our Embassy in
                    Moscow were largely from DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency). Some of them were
                    associated with the CIA.</p>
                <p>When GRU people traveled or were out “doing something,” they were looked at very
                    carefully by all of the members of the clearance committee. On the committee
                    were representatives of the military, CIA, FBI, I think, maybe, the ABC-all of
                    those agencies involved in national security in one way or another were members
                    of the clearance committee. We didn't meet around a table. It was very rare that
                    we sat down and discussed some issue. We handled it by telephone. Obviously, we
                    were not discussing classified material on the telephone, but we knew what the
                    issue was. We also used interagency memoranda transmitted by secure, interagency
                    means, much like telegrams from our Embassies abroad. If the FBI, for example,
                    had a reason to object to a certain person leaving Washington, they would send a
                    “No” back to the State Department and often come and visit me to discuss the
                    problem. We would have to go back to them and say that you can't just say “No.”
                    A negative response was only acceptable if one of the agencies had a very strong
                    defendable objection to the individual's travel. Usually, there weren't many
                    objections. For instance, you didn't have the FBI and the CIA squabbling over
                    whether one Soviet official went on a particular trip or didn't go. Usually, if
                    there was a serous doubt, they didn't go.</p>
                <p>Often, reciprocity was the principal consideration. I don't say that we did it to
                    be mean. We would declare someone persona non grata, taking the next person in
                    the list I kept of folks deserving to be expelled. Action of this kind wasn't
                    taken out of meanness. It was because the persons involved had the biggest or
                    the most “black marks” against them and/or because it was time to exercise
                    reciprocity for what was being done in Moscow.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned the “black box.” First of all, what did that
                        mean and how did you rank the bad guys?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: I had 5” x 7” file cards and a black file box big enough to hold them. It
                    was three or four inches thick. I kept cards which I made out myself, every time
                    a new Soviet diplomat arrived, with his (there were few “hers” in those days)
                    name and probably date of birth, as well as his title. The CIA keeps regular
                    biographies on these people. I probably prepared a summary of their biographies
                    on the front of the card. Basically, these were UNCLASSIFIED cards. That is,
                    there was UNCLASSIFIED information on them, but it was not to be distributed. I
                    didn't put extraordinarily sensitive information on the cards, but I indicated
                    on the card whether they were believed to be GRU or KGB. I indicated what their
                    assignment might be.</p>
                <p>Routinely, FBI information flowed to us on these people, as they were observed in
                    their functions, or were visited, perhaps, by somebody. As you know, it's rather
                    common knowledge that the FBI kept a keen eye and ear on what happened within
                    the Soviet Embassy and when Embassy personnel traveled. FBI reports on these
                    people went across my desk. I would read them. They tended to be terribly
                    involved, extraordinarily bureaucratic, and written in a kind of “double talk.”
                    Never could they say that the information came from eavesdropping, because they
                    would never admit it. They would say that the information came from “a known,
                    reliable source,” a “thought to be reliable source,” a “suspected to be reliable
                    source,” or a “sometimes reliable source.” They used these “jargon” words to
                    describe a mechanical device or, in some cases, a real person “who is known to
                    be.” The report contained those “caveats,” and I would then make a note—if the
                    man had been “caught” servicing a suspected mail box or “lamp post”. In other
                    words, activity which involved really serious indications that the man was
                    “performing duties not in accordance with his diplomatic status.” That, of
                    course, was the basis for declaring him persona non grata. This, of course, is
                    what the Soviets did frequently, but it was a matter of degree or seriousness
                    behind their motive.</p>
                <p>I would put little sentences on the card which would accumulate over the year or
                    years that the Soviet diplomat had behaved in “improper” fashion. Then I
                    shuffled the cards in “rank” order of black marks. Number one card probably was
                    PNGed next.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it really at your discretion to pull out a card, give
                        it to your superiors, and say to him, “This is the next person in line to be
                        'PNGed'?”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes, but the only word I would argue with is “discretion.” It was a
                    mechanical thing. I kept records of this kind on these people in the box,
                    basically in chronological order. As new people arrived, I would put them at the
                    back of the box, to work their way forward. What we tried to do was what the
                    Soviets tried to do. That was to “PNG” the right person. Obviously, there would
                    be people whom we would “PNG” in their own right. If a person really got caught
                    “red handed,” the FBI wanted to kick him out of the country. Sometimes they'd go
                    “public” which forced our hands. We objected, but the CIA really raised the
                    roof: “Now they'll get one of ours”. The question would get into the newspapers,
                    and the American public would demand, “Get this man out of our country.”</p>
                <p>However, often—and I don't have any specific recollection of a real case—if the
                    Soviets “PNGed” one of our people, later on they would say that it was their
                    right to do this, and they of course were correct. Hopefully, it would be
                    somebody who was nearing the end of his tour in Moscow. To expel somebody early
                    in his tour meant that you were “throwing him out” forever, because once a
                    person is “PNGed,” he will seldom be able to go back to that country. In a very
                    few cases we were able to arrange for people who had been “PNGed” to go back to
                    Moscow, but there were very few of these. So by “PNGing” somebody, you were
                    ending that person's career in Soviet affairs, as well as blow years of
                    preparation and expertise.</p>
                <p>So PNGing was a very serious step. It applied to the Soviet Bloc countries, too.
                    The Soviets also did not want their person to have to leave the United States
                    after he had only been here for, say, a week or a month. He would have gone
                    through an enormously extended period of training. Read the book, “The Charm
                    School,” by Nelson De Mille, for example, to get some idea of the years of
                    training involved for some of them. Our people are trained for a shorter period,
                    but it still involves a long period of time and lots of resources.</p>
                <p>So the decision to “PNG” somebody was a chronological decision. You tried to find
                    someone who had been in, say, Washington about the same length of time as the
                    person expelled from our Embassy in Moscow. However, the thickness of the card,
                    the length of the entries, “earning” his place at the top of the list (or front
                    of the box) because of the behavior he had been involved in would also play a
                    role in the selection of the person for expulsion. Maybe there had been clear,
                    previous expressions of our dismay at the behavior of the person. That sort of
                    thing would cause such a person to come to the front of the box. I would
                    maintain the box mechanically, but often driven by the lengthy of service in
                    Washington.. I would be asked, “Who's next?” And I would say, “Abramov,” or
                    whoever. I would prepare a memorandum giving the reasons for the choice—maybe
                    attaching the full FBI reports which I had received and filed away. The final
                    decision would always be decided at a very high level. Maybe it would require
                    approval by the Secretary of State for someone to be “PNGed,” because of the
                    possible ramifications</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could we talk about some of the other things that you did.
                        Did you monitor the movement of ships?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes. For lack of a more specific term, I had a sort of “military”
                    responsibility: the military, in general, although certainly our
                    political-military people and our military people had a big piece of that.
                    However, on bilateral political issues, I was pretty much responsible for
                    military matters. Very few of these involved the Soviet Army or Air Force. Once
                    in a while an incident would occur in which a U. S. plane had been shot down by
                    mistake, deliberately, or whatever. But that was rare. The same was true of the
                    Soviet Army. All of the exercises held were so routine that nobody ever crossed
                    the line into the Federal Republic of Germany.</p>
                <p>I think that the biggest thing I got involved in concerned John Hemenway, a
                    former U.S. military officer and later an FSO, diplomat in Moscow. He was on the
                    German desk when I was in SOV. He came storming into my office one day and said,
                    “Bill, we must get ready to go to war!” He was livid. I asked, “What happened?”
                    He said, “Well, the Soviet Army in Berlin is making us lower the tail gates of
                    our trucks.” We had refused to lower our tail gates, and this became a very
                    serious issue between the Soviet Army and the U. S. Army. Things like that were
                    rare. That was more a question of John Hemenway getting excited than it was an
                    issue between the Soviet and American Armies, because in Berlin all sides kept
                    things fairly under control and orderly. They weren't “poking” each other.
                    Incidentally, John calmed down, eventually, and we didn't go to war, and I can't
                    remember what we did with our tail gates!</p>
                <p>That left the Navy—and the Treasury, because, I might remind you—the Department
                    of the Treasury was then responsible for the Coast Guard. (I believe the Coast
                    Guard came under the Department of Transportation in 1967.) The Coast Guard was
                    where most of the “action” was for me. But, first of all, the Navy. Both the
                    Soviet and the American Navy—I would like to say, absolutely equally—like to
                    play “chicken.” I think it must be something written in the manuals of both
                    navies. My son is in the Navy. I must ask him to say what the manual says about
                    encounters with Soviet Navy ships. Clearly, it was part of the “game”—to break
                    the boredom, that's what you do on the high seas in the North, when the icebergs
                    are coming at you. You play “chicken.” to test each other—each other's prowess
                    and professional abilities. I exaggerate somewhat, but not a lot. When we got
                    into these cases afterwards, we found out that that's what was happening. They
                    had become too damned “clever” and “cute.” And, of course, I would have to blame
                    the other side for being equally “cute,” or I think I used the work
                    “provocative” in the diplomatic note I drafted. I knew the Soviets would
                    understand that word. I got into such incidents, encounters; they ended up on my
                    desk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you remember one, specific incident? What does that
                        mean and how did it reach your desk?</hi>

                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>MORGAN: Let's say that it happened near Murmansk, out on the high seas, where
                    there are more Soviet than American ships. We have an American submarine, and
                    there is a Soviet submarine operating nearby. Or an American cruiser or
                    destroyer. A Soviet flotilla is coming out from Soviet territorial waters and
                    into the high seas, off Norway. The first thing you know an American cruiser is
                    passing a Soviet cruiser, six yards apart. Or they scrape each other or back
                    into each other. They are “playing games” on the high seas and at some speed.
                    This was happening—and still happens. It's a way—I should not go on any further
                    in characterizing this behavior. But it was trouble, because you had to back
                    your way through “non-apologies,” through “who saw it first,” through “intensive
                    examinations,” through things that took an awful lot of time for just one,
                    simple thing. From one Navy to another Navy. And no lessons learned whatsoever,
                    nor victories claimed.</p>
                <p>The big thing with the Navy, with the Coast Guard, in part, and with the Canadian
                    Government, because it sometimes happened in Canadian territorial waters,
                    transit through the “Northwest Passage,” for example, in the area of pack ice,
                    and sometimes under the ice. The Navy made an annual or maybe semi-annual trip
                    through the Northwest Passage. Some of the trip was by submarine under the ice.
                    A lot of it was by cruisers through the pack ice, preceded by icebreakers. It
                    was our Navy's way of asserting our “rights.” We did not accept Canadian claim
                    of national waters or said all navies have the right of transit from one
                    national territory to another. This basically is international naval law and
                    what keeps lawyers in business. The high seas are anyone's territory. There was
                    a big question regarding the Dardanelles Strait, which flows into the
                    Mediterranean Sea, and other, similar issues, involving international waters.
                    Who proves that they are international waters? The fleets of the various
                    nations. That's where we got into trouble. Sometimes it involved the Canadians.
                    They said that the Northwest Passage is in their territory, and we have to ask
                    their permission to pass through it. The Soviets would go through, our Navy
                    would go through, and we would find ourselves involved in encounters and
                    disputes—sometimes caused by “provocative acts” on our part or on their part. In
                    some cases these were accidental. Some of these incidents were tragic, in which
                    some people lost their lives.</p>
                <p>But naval tradition was also the basis for one of the nicer aspects of bilateral
                    Soviet-American relations. Let me now switch 180 degrees. When one sailor is in
                    trouble, another sailor helps. It doesn't matter what country it is. If there is
                    an accident on the high seas, a ship of another Navy will come to the rescue.
                    I've seen some cases of the Soviet Navy helping the American Navy.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>As an outgrowth of the Navy and other U.S. agencies, I remember case of
                    exceptional cooperation. When I was in SOV I got very much involved in a program
                    which the Soviets wanted. It first came up when I was on a trip to Siberia and
                    visited the Far North The topic is “permafrost.”—permanently frozen earth just
                    inches under the surface. The Soviets had an excellent Permafrost Institute in
                    Yakutsk up near the Arctic Circle. I spent a day there with the director and
                    staff. We had some undertakings with Canada, especially since we adjoined
                    territorially in the frozen north. With the Soviets, who joined in with Canada
                    and the U.S. some wonderful things developed—testing permafrost conditions and
                    exchanging information. That was one of the more positive things that happened
                    with the U,S.S.R. back in the days of the Cold War.</p>
                <p>Contact with the Coast Guard was really the area where most of my time with
                    maritime affairs was spent. This involved Soviet ships coming, either by request
                    or by accident, into American ports. There were far fewer American ships going
                    into Soviet ports, in part because the USSR doesn't have the number or types of
                    ports that we do. Soviet ports are located in a very limited area along the
                    Pacific Ocean and the Baltic and Black Seas. We had some problems with the Black
                    Sea when American ships tried to get to Soviet ports. Actually, some of the
                    Soviet ships had accidents or problems off our coasts and they needed to be
                    rescued or assisted. But all of that needed our permission—literally, my
                    agreement.</p>
                <p>We had one official from the office of the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury
                    who was responsible for Coast Guard affairs. We had some stressful moments. I
                    guess that I “excited” him, particularly when I had to raise a problem with him
                    in the middle of the night, such as Treasury's ok for a Soviet ship to come into
                    New York. Usually, under such extreme conditions, such a request involved an
                    accident to the ship's engines or something like that. In other cases it was
                    deliberate—they were merely testing us. Finally, in some cases, it was simply a
                    “formal” request.</p>
                <p>We in State were always looking for ways to try to improve Soviet-American
                    relationships. Sometimes, there were little things like these maritime issues
                    which were symbolic and which both sides, down into the two system, wanted. That
                    is, the U. S. Coast Guard and the Soviet Maritime fleets and counterparts. There
                    were a lot of forces out there that weren't trying to find ways to show us as
                    enemies but, rather, how we might relieve some of the tensions that existed
                    between the two superpowers..</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>This often involved working within the Soviet system of bureaucratic controls. We
                    knew that if we could “eat away” at rigid, “knee jerk” reactions to Cold War
                    antagonisms it would eventually produce a more relaxed relationship, d�tente, if
                    I may use the exact term.. It would be better to keep working at this tactic:
                    the visitor exchanges program, for example.. By the way, the Soviets had—how
                    shall we say it—ideological reasons to support such exchange agreements. They
                    were ideological in the sense of showing the Soviet Union as a country rich in
                    cultural affairs such as music, opera, ballet, literature...and highly
                    competitive in scientific research and accomplishments. It was rewarding to see
                    some of our military colleagues—certainly maritime—recognize that it was in our
                    national interest to strive to reduce tensions and sources of disagreement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you think of any other, specific issues that you
                        covered which were of particular interest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. Then, after two years on the Soviet desk,
                        1964-1966, you moved to the Office of Personnel in the Department of State
                        as a Career Counselor. Would you tell us how you got this assignment and why
                        you, in particular, were given that assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes, it has a very Soviet-related answer. As my tour in SOV was nearing
                    an end—and remember that at that time we didn't “bid” for assignments—we
                    “shopped” for them or people “shopped” for us. They looked us up in various
                    lists of jobs in the Foreign Service around the world. Or many of us simply
                    waited for the system to tell us where we were going. There was a certain sense
                    of “discipline,” if I may use that word. It was more common and acceptable than
                    it is today.</p>
                <p>I went to a Career Counselor or someone else in Personnel and asked, “What's
                    next?” I was told, “Well, the next logical thing is to talk to Jake Beam.” He
                    had been Ambassador to the Soviet Union and, I think, was subsequently
                    Ambassador elsewhere. Anyhow, he was a Sovietologist who was a very senior
                    person in the Foreign Service. He was assigned to Geneva, in charge of a series
                    of delegations there which primarily were involved in Soviet-U. S. discussions
                    on disarmament and other, major policy issues. I think it was U.N. connected. I
                    was supposed to go and replace a senior person on his staff, who is actually
                    bilingual in English and Russian. He was of Russian origin and had done nothing
                    in his life but work on the Soviet Union. He had served in the Foreign Service
                    in the Soviet Union and wanted to spend his professional life in Soviet affairs.
                    At least, this was the way I was told this. I can't remember his name, perhaps
                    Peter Tarnoff</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>Well, I was interviewed by Ambassador Jake Beam, who was in Washington at the
                    time. I was very impressed with the man. He was very kind and generous and
                    seemed very pleased with the meeting. He called me up afterwards and said that
                    he would be very honored if I would join his staff. However, he said, if I
                    didn't want to do this for any reason, I should feel free not to take up this
                    offer. The more I thought about it, the more I thought that I would be replacing
                    a very highly qualified person who had worked on disarmament issues. Many of
                    these issues are extremely sophisticated and with which I had had no working
                    knowledge to do with. I had been involved in bilateral, not multilateral affairs
                    on the Soviet desk and internal affairs in the Embassy in Moscow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is the difference between “bilateral” and
                        “multilateral” affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: I should have made that clear before. On the Soviet desk there were three
                    sections: multilateral, bilateral, and economic. In “multilateral” affairs you
                    would get into “other country” or multinational issues and such as disarmament
                    and NATO relationships. “Bilateral” affairs refer to U. S. - Soviet bilateral
                    relationships, involving more “nitty gritty” ship confrontations, PNGing Soviet
                    diplomats, and that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>So I thought quite a bit about this choice I had. It was a great honor to be
                    offered a position on Ambassador Beam's staff, and my ego was properly inflated.
                    However, the job would involve an assignment to Geneva much of the time and
                    would require a great deal of travel back and forth between Geneva and
                    Washington. In my view my knowledge of Russian would have to be at the 5 - 5
                    (bilingual, or “perfect”) level. It isn't, it wasn't, it never would
                    be—certainly not on the level of the native-born Russian speaker that I would be
                    replacing. Secondly, dealing with issues like disarmament which were so complex
                    and with which I had had minimal touch would be very difficult. My wife and I
                    talked it over. I discussed the assignment with colleagues of mine.</p>
                <p>Finally, I decided to go and see my Career Counselor in Personnel. My Career
                    Counselor was Morris Draper, an Arabist himself who later worked with Ambassador
                    Phil Habib on various aspects of Lebanese affairs. We chatted about it. He said,
                    “Bill, I hear exactly what you're saying. I think that you've been in Soviet
                    affairs for a long time now. You've been in Russian language training and Soviet
                    affairs, in Moscow and Washington for six years. I think that it's time for you
                    to expand your horizons a little. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger is talking
                    about getting people 'out of their area of specialization' and mixing them up a
                    little. I think it's time for you to do something else.”</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>I said, “Morrie, what do you think I should do?” He said, “Come and join me in
                    Personnel.” I said, “You're crazy. I don't know anything about Personnel.” He
                    said, “Neither do I—none of us does here. We have lots of 'technicians' who do
                    the 'nitty gritty.' You would be the one who does the counseling. You would be
                    the one who advises Foreign Service Officers on where to go. You would work with
                    the Geographic bureaus on who gets what person for what job.” I said that that
                    was an interesting thought.</p>
                <p>I was introduced to his boss, Bob HoughtoWe ended up in agreement on my next
                    assignment: Central Personnel. Bob Houghton ended up being my boss in my next
                    assignment: Embassy Beirut. I spent two, wonderful years in Personnel and worked
                    with people at my own grade, age, and experience level in mid career. They
                    became good friends and remained so throughout the years. To me—and I have said
                    this to any Foreign Service Officer who would listen to me—it was a vitally
                    necessary assignment in any institution. You've got to know how the system
                    works, and you learn this in Personnel. Subsequently, during service on the
                    Board of Examiners for the Foreign Service and as a Foreign Service Inspector
                    and my last tour: Director of the Office of Employee Relations, I saw that this
                    assignment to Personnel had been my first, real exposure to the realities, the
                    fairness, the openness, and the integrity of the system. Of course I also saw
                    some “negatives” or ways to help the System help itself.</p>
                <p>Then the System had fewer strictures on it. I would say that some of the
                    strictures that have been imposed in recent years have had a negative impact.
                    However, that's just my opinion, though I know that I share it with others.
                    During the time that I was in Personnel I won't say that the Service seemed to
                    be composed of “gentlemen,” because that would obviously sound “sexist.”
                    However, it was composed of a group of people doing what they thought was best
                    for the interests of the Department of State, the nation, and best for the
                    individual in terms of assignments.</p>
                <p>That's what I ended up doing. During my first year in Personnel I worked with
                    mid-career, Political Officers, working out ways for them to get the best
                    “growth” assignments and training. In time I added mid-career, Consular Officers
                    to my “bag.” That was at a time when we had a large number of Foreign Service
                    Staff Officers who had never been required to serve in the U.S., as an FSO is.
                    These Staff Officers had been integrated into the FSO Corps under the Wriston
                    Program some years before and now their time to serve at home had arrived. I had
                    about 80 technician-type former Staff Officers whom I had to bring back from
                    overseas on their next assignment and find a job for them in the Department of
                    State.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>I was also there at the time when the “Cone” system was installed. Many people in
                    the Foreign Service today think that the “Cone” system goes back almost to the
                    foundation of the United States. Actually, this system was developed when I was
                    in Personnel in the mid-1960's (1966-1968). It represented an attempt by
                    Personnel “experts”—not Foreign Service Officers—to try to adjust the system and
                    make it more capable of coming up with a “proper” balance between jobs and what
                    was needed in these jobs and people. It also evaluated FSOs' strengths and
                    weaknesses and how to train them to the future needs of the Service. One of the
                    ways of doing that was to try to identify their professional skills and assign
                    them to certain specialties: Political, Economic, Administrative, and Consular.
                    To this day the “Cone” system has not worked effectively. However, it was an
                    attempt to do this. It really doesn't matter, as long as you have some sort of
                    system, and keep changing it as has been the case. Oh, and don't tell the
                    “troops” too much about it; they might catch on and learn how “to beat it”.</p>
                <p>To achieve this balance between job needs and people skills, we—as career
                    counselors and custodians of the Central System—fought with the Geographic
                    bureaus—who had to fill jobs— to make sure that officers got “good” positions.
                    We tried to make certain that the assignments had growth potential in them. We
                    sought to get them out of some specialties that they had been assigned to over
                    the years and to make them “generalists,” We also had a “new” buzz work:
                    management. We worked to give them a kind of “raw” management skills. You don't
                    get management skills by simply going into consular or administrative
                    assignments where obviously such skills were essential. You learned these by
                    working effectively with people, the intricacies and demands of managing people
                    effectively. At the same time leaders had to manage programs and the resources
                    necessary to run them. Let's add foreigners into this pot, officials and
                    employees and all of this in foreign settings. If you don't have the right
                    officer in the right spot, fully equipped and trained to perform effectively,,
                    the assignment is not done well—and the boss gets mad!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your interaction with other Foreign Service
                        Officers as Career Counselor for the Consular Cone?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: We all had our own little areas of responsibility. Mine ended up FSO-3
                    and FSO-4 officers—mid-career— in both Political and Consular “Cones” At the
                    time, based on their experiences, they had just became “Coned.” Lorry Lawrence
                    took over the Consular officers nearer to the end of my tour. Whenever a given
                    person was on home leave, he or she was required to have an interview with a
                    Career Counselor. We would read their entire personnel file before the
                    appointment, which means I would have read all of the efficiency reports that
                    had been written on them. Obviously, the more recent ones were the more
                    important ones. I would do a summary of what they had done, where they had gone,
                    and what their job future looked like. I would project 10 years of future
                    assignments for them. I would hand this report to them, after having sat with
                    them and summarized my impression of how they had done. Before the session they
                    also had the opportunity to reread their file.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>Remember, the only way that an officer really knows how he is doing—no matter
                    what his boss says or anything else—is a promotion. If he made the promotion
                    list, he knows that he has “done it.” If he doesn't make the list, he thinks
                    that he's a failure. Now, that's unfair. It's wrong. However, as a
                    “dispassionate, highly professional” Career Counselor, I could give them what I
                    hope they would take as a fair, clear analysis—not from anybody who was their
                    boss or had a operational line of concern in him, but rather a dispassionate
                    evaluation. That's what the interview consisted of. As a result, we more or less
                    negotiated over their next 10 years of assignments. I would tell a given officer
                    that, from what I hear, it's time for you to do a little bit of this, or get out
                    of this area and into that. They could speak up, for or against my views. Then
                    they got a final product. We had negotiated a projection of their next 10
                    years.</p>
                <p>It didn't mean that they were going to get those assignments, as the system
                    works. However, that's what we would aim at. They would know openly that this is
                    what the System was looking at and that they could expect support from Central
                    Personnel if they would go along with it as much as feasible. So, in that sense,
                    it was communications between a colleague and the individual officer. They were
                    getting an appraisal from the System as to how they were doing and where they
                    were going.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the FSO's respond to you as a Career
                        Counselor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Well, of course, I have a biased view. I have my own impression of them.
                    They weren't about to say, “I hate you!” I compared notes with other Career
                    Counselors. Others would say, “You just 'bombed out' on Charley X. You'd better
                    call him back in. He went out, screaming and yelling.” Well, that didn't happen
                    very often. I think that I can say, dispassionately, that I had positive
                    feedback on the vast majority of the officers I interviewed.</p>
                <p>The geographic and functional bureaus, of course, had direct supervision of these
                    people, because they were assigned to a specific bureaus. First of all, as I was
                    in Moscow, working for the European Bureau, the Bureau knew best my performance.
                    The Bureau knew about the career counseling interview, especially if the officer
                    concerned went charging in to his colleagues and complained, or whatever. I
                    think that, weighing all of those things, the procedures at that time worked
                    pretty well as a part of the assignments process. As I recall, we developed
                    figures during my first assignment to Personnel which indicated that 75% of the
                    assignments we recommended were agreed all the way through the system and,
                    hopefully, professionally developed the officers concerned. I think that another
                    answer to that question is, “We all like to know that the system, the
                    organization, as opposed to your boss, your colleague, or whoever, has a view of
                    you, appreciates what you have done, and gives you an opportunity to talk back.”
                    These conversations, obviously, had considerable impact on the officer. They
                    really “let their hair down.” They said, “You know what I just went through at
                    this post? You know what that boss was like? That Ambassador is a mess.”</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>This is where these very privileged, private memoranda of our individual
                    counseling sessions were particularly useful. These memoranda went to no one
                    else. It was a very privileged file. No one had access to it but the individual
                    officer and the very small group of Career Counselors. This file was not shared
                    with any of the geographic bureaus. I think that that was one of the most
                    important aspects of them. The officer could speak most frankly and talk about
                    things—give an opinion on a post, give an opinion on other people and the ways
                    the system sort of brings us together. Some people might call it “corridor
                    talk.” Well, it doesn't take place in the corridors of the Department of State.
                    It takes place in these privileged files, in a sense.</p>
                <p>When a person is coming up for an assignment, you can refer to his file and,
                    based on your knowledge of the person, say, “No, I don't think that that's the
                    place for that officer to go.” I recommended very strongly against one person
                    going to Africa. He ended up going there anyway—despite my input. During this
                    African assignment he ended up murdering the communicator at the post to which
                    he was assigned. My advice was that he had spent too long a time in Africa. I
                    thought that he was “around the bend” or “over the cliff.” And he was
                    psychologically troubled, in fact. I'm not trying to say, “I told you so,” but
                    we had some ability to “defend” the overall professional interests of the
                    officer. We really were “systems people” for the individuals that we were
                    talking about.</p>
                <p>That involved talking about all of their strengths and weaknesses. We at times
                    had to say, “Charley, this is something in your performance which is clear as a
                    bell.” The career counselors had a file on these officers, going back 10 or 15
                    years, so you knew that this was not a one-time report. Everything in the report
                    said, for example, “You would improve if you drafted better! (That really means
                    you don't know how to write!) I think that there's a problem there.” I wish that
                    it were that simple, explicit, though it sometimes was. However, there was
                    enough there that you could share the system's views of performance with the
                    officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After your two years as a Career Counselor in the Office
                        of Personnel, 1966-1968, you were assigned to the U. S. Embassy in Beirut,
                        Lebanon, as the chief of the Consular Section. Was it an interesting time to
                        be assigned there? Tell us how you got that assignment and how you felt
                        about it at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: That's one of the stories that I do remember. Many of these other
                    memories have “faded,” haven't they? They always say in the Foreign Service, as
                    they do in most institutions, that if you're in Personnel, you can “name” any
                    assignment you want. You can have your “pick” of the system. Well, that's kind
                    of true, but not quite. You still have to be approved by the Bureau involved and
                    you have to be qualified. However, it is true that you do have a little “edge”
                    on where you want to go.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>I had the possibility of one of two assignments. The first one would have been as
                    Political Counselor in Belgrade Yugoslavia. The second one would have been as
                    Political Counselor in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Neither of those assignments
                    materialized. I convinced the Yugoslav desk officer that Russian was not the
                    same as Serbo-Croatian, that I couldn't make the transition without taking
                    another language, and that I wasn't about to take on another Slavic language. A
                    dear friend of mine had served in Belgrade. He said that it was kind of “the
                    pits,” not very interesting, and a dirty, dirty place. Haiti sounded a little
                    better. I remembered a couple of friends who had served there. Then, of course,
                    there were a lot of complications. Haiti was the country of “Papa Doc” Duvalier.
                    Well, I was formally assigned to Port-au-Prince. I was “paneled,” as they say in
                    the Department.</p>
                <p>Loren Lawrence, who had recently come to the Department from Tel Aviv Israel, was
                    my Career Counselor colleague in charge of consular affairs. We became very,
                    very good friends. I went in to see him one day and said, “I've got this fellow
                    who is terrific. He's been in Moscow, and I know him very well. He did a superb
                    job in Moscow, doing consular work. There is this job in Beirut as chief of the
                    Consular Section. He would be perfect for the job. He is up for assignment.”
                    Loren said, “Bill, we've been trying to 'sell' this guy. No one will take him. I
                    know you are well intentioned, but that job is too good for him. It is
                    fascinating. I've just come from Tel Aviv and know what Beirut is like. It's
                    simply a beautiful country. You'll love it. Your family will love it. It's just
                    great for you. It is a responsible job. You'll have a really interesting job
                    there.”</p>
                <p>I said, “What do you mean, that I'm going to have an interesting job there? I'm
                    going to Port-au-Prince.” He said, “No, no, Bill, Port-au-Prince is not for you.
                    You're going to Beirut.” I said, “Come on, Loren, this is insane.” I told my
                    wife about this conversation, and she said, “I refuse to listen to you any more.
                    You tell me where you're going. I refuse to discuss any more future assignments
                    with you.”</p>
                <p>So I was assigned to Beirut, and it was just the job which involved my strengths
                    and didn't focus on my weaknesses. It was a hell of a lot of fun for five years.
                    So I was assigned there “through the back door,” if you will. I had really
                    excellent career counseling by a fellow Career Counselor.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your tour in Beirut from 1958 to 1973 is covered in the
                        first interview with you, which took place on June 27, 1988. You were
                        interviewed by Charles Stuart Kennedy. That interview also covers all of
                        your service after Beirut, with the exception of 1973-1974, when you served

                        assignment in the Foreign Service— when you were Director of Employee

                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>You were transferred from your position as Chief of the Consular Section in the
                    American Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, to Director of the Consular Panel of the
                    Board of Examiners for the Foreign Service in the Department of State. Tell us
                    how you got that assignment while you were in Beirut and how you felt about
                    leaving an overseas assignment and coming back to Washington.</p>
                <p>MORGAN: I received a telephone call from a friend in the Bureau of Consular
                    Affairs, who was a staff assistant to the Assistant Secretary of the bureau. He
                    was “bracing” me for this “terrible” news, which I was obviously going to
                    reject, that I was going to be assigned to the Board of Examiners for the
                    Foreign Service. I say “bracing,” because the Board of Examiners has not had a
                    terribly good reputation over the years. That's the place where the Department
                    sort of “dumps” people when they have reached the end of their careers. It's
                    always been filled with a lot of bureaucrats. That was its reputation, although,
                    as you know, reputations are not always fully deserved. Certainly, the Board of
                    Examiners, at that period, was doing everything in its power to become a very
                    active, very significant, vital process—indeed, the only way in which you could
                    enter the Foreign Service, unless you came in under very special programs which
                    they have. So my informant was certainly waiting for me to “blow up.” Instead, I
                    said, “Well, no, that sounds interesting. What does it mean?” He said, “It means
                    a lot of travel. It means that you're going to have to leave for Africa right
                    away and give the Foreign Service oral exam to candidates all over Africa. And
                    you're going to have to travel all over the United States.” I said, “It sounds
                    great! I'll take it!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can we back up a little? Can you give us a job description
                        of this assignment—what the Chairman of the Consular Panel is?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: The Board of Examiners as, I suppose, most of your readers know, is the
                    body which administers the oral examination to all candidates who wish to come
                    into the Foreign Service as Foreign Service Officers. It also is responsible for
                    screening and recruiting clerical staff employees, such as secretaries, for
                    Security Officers, and for other specialists. However, the biggest “chunk” of
                    the job I was in—not in terms of numbers of people but in terms of effort—was
                    the administration of] the FSO oral exams. With the exception of certain,
                    special programs, which we can talk about later, all candidates had to take a
                    written exam. When I came into the Foreign Service, it was a three-day exam.
                    When I was on the Board of Examiners, it was a one-day exam. As I recall it,
                    roughly 200,000 people took the written exam, and 20,000 passed it and 200 pass
                    the oral. (As a marvelous euphemism we said, “recommended for further
                    consideration.”.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is the written exam given on the same day as the oral
                        exam?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>MORGAN: No. The written exam is given once a year—it used to be on the first
                    Saturday of December. This year [1995] it won't be given at all, because we have
                    too many people in the Foreign Service, so “Management” says. But that's a
                    different subject. I think that the number of people who take the exam is still
                    roughly 200,000, with 20,000 passing. This pass mark is based on a “curve.” In
                    other words, you “draw the line” after the top-scoring 20,000 candidates have
                    been reached. That “line” then becomes 70 percent, the passing score.. Those
                    that “pass” are sent a letter and invited to take the oral exam. Of those who
                    are invited, not all come. Some took the Foreign Service exam as a “lark,” some
                    have meanwhile received better job offers, or whatever. I don't know the exact
                    figure, but roughly 50 percent plus of the 20,000 actually sign up for the oral
                    exam.</p>
                <p>The oral exam is given by the Board of Examiners. During my time there, the Board
                    was divided into four “cones,” which I described previously. The “cone” system
                    tried to look at people specialized in one or more areas during the major part
                    of their careers (Consular, Administrative, Political, or Economic). When I was
                    Chairman of the Consular Panel in the Board of Examiners, there were three other
                    “chairpersons,” one for each of the other three “cones.” With us was a
                    representative of USIA since that agency, under the Foreign Service Act,
                    recruited and examined and successful candidates were appointed as FSIOs, “I”
                    being Information. We were basically responsible for the “tone” and the general
                    way in which the exam was given, in terms of our respective specialization. Now,
                    what do I mean by that?</p>
                <p>All Foreign Service candidates are orally evaluated “across the board.” Everyone
                    is queried about their suitability in general competence as well as potential
                    Political, Economic, Administrative, and Consular affairs. My job was to make
                    sure that the “consular” type of questioning was good and “honed in” on the
                    qualities which various, scientific studies and our own experience had shown to
                    make the “best” consular officers. They had to be Foreign Service Officers,
                    first and foremost. They also had to have, shall we say, certain tendencies to
                    “succeed” in the specialization for which they were applying for admission. At
                    the time of the written or the oral exam—I can't remember which—they were
                    required to say what “cone” they wanted to compete in. This is ludicrous,
                    obviously. A person doesn't know, usually. He or she usually doesn't have but
                    the faintest idea what those “cones” are. However, they were required to “lock
                    themselves in” to one “cone” or another. Clearly, this system hasn't
                    remained—and couldn't remain—that rigid. However, at the time of the oral exam,
                    it was my job to see that we were getting the best opportunity to select those
                    who had chosen the consular “cone” to be competitive and to be productive,
                    consular officers. By sitting in on the exams, I was present, or we had other
                    consular examiners on the Consular Panel there. One of the three of us assigned
                    to BEX sat in on the oral examination of every person who had chosen the
                    consular “cone.”</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>We also sat in on other “cone” exams. Maybe I would “steer” consular questions on
                    those exams. We all worked together as a very well-tuned group of 12 or so
                    examiners, including our USIA colleague, In addition, during the peak season, we
                    also had part-time people. They were not volunteers but were assigned to these
                    duties on a part-time basis. They were good people who were available for these
                    duties, perhaps between assignments. They would join us, especially as we
                    traveled about the U.S., because when the full “season” came around, we gave the
                    oral exam in a number of places—about 10 or 15 cities around the country.</p>
                <p>When people were told that they had passed the written exam, they were asked when
                    and where they would like to take the oral exam. They would put in dates, and we
                    would get to the dates they requested as nearly as possible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us about the kind of qualities you looked for, as a
                        representative of the consular “cone.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: I examined them against the overall qualification of a “well rounded” and
                    well equipped human being. I say “human,” because consular work demands a little
                    extra human quality, I think—an understanding of other people, including
                    suffering people. Some of the qualities included an ability to make a decision.
                    Consular Officers have to make decisions—sometimes unpleasant ones. A visa “line
                    officer” has, perhaps, 30 seconds to make a decision on whether a person is
                    qualified to come to the United States as a tourist, a student, a Ph. D. in
                    physics, or whatever. This is really “impossible” to do, but Consular Officers
                    have to do this, under pressure, often in extremely hard, physical conditions.
                    Visa lines in Jamaica, for example, are insufferable. A visa line in Moscow is
                    an extraordinarily difficult place to work, for a different reason. So, first of
                    all, we examiners searched for signs of the candidate”s ability to demonstrate
                    confidence in their own judgment and to make good judgments as quickly as
                    possible.</p>
                <p>Secondly, I looked for a sense of humor. If you can't face all that with a sense
                    of humor, seek another career.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>Thirdly, there is the question as to how a candidate makes decisions without
                    adequate information. How do you “save” yourself? Do you go and “hide”? I'll
                    give you one example, my favorite, if you will. We would formulate this question
                    in one way or another. “Suppose that you are a vice-consul in Cairo. You know
                    nothing about consular work. This is your first day on the job, and the phone
                    rings. You're sitting at your desk. A tourist guide calls you from the Pyramids
                    and informs you that an American woman in his group has just died. What are you
                    going to do?” How did the candidate react to that question? Did he or she
                    “blanch”? “Giggle”? “Go and hide”? “Just hang up the phone”? “Run to the
                    Ambassador for assistance”? “Reach for the Foreign Service Manual”? What did he
                    or she do? There's no “right or wrong” answer to these questions. However, there
                    are some things which are a better indicator as to the candidate's ability to
                    make decisions. The response might be, “Well, I went and got the 'Foreign
                    Service Manual' and read it for the next three hours.” If so, I might think that
                    the person was perhaps better suited to intelligence research than to be a
                    consular officer.</p>
                <p>Let's say that the candidate did react by going right to the scene, sensing that
                    on-the—scene was where the action and decision-making was, was needed there—or
                    thought so. He or she may have gone by the boss on the way out, saying, “Do you
                    have any advice, boss?” Since newly appointed, this reflects the wisdom of
                    picking up some clues on how to proceed. This “new Vice Consul” gets there and
                    goes through it all, examining the corpse, and arranging with the tourist agent
                    to have it brought back to the proper authorities and all that sort of thing,
                    plus a lot of TLC (tender, loving care) for the other tourists in the group.
                    Then, all of a sudden, we, the examiners would say, “How do you know that she's
                    an American?” Wham! We'd just sawed off the candidate's limb. How to recover
                    from that? Smiles, laughter? Or, “Oh, oh, you got me on that one, Charley.” Or
                    does the poor soul panic, or what? All of these little things. Perhaps that's
                    not a good example, but it's the idea of reactions as a human being. If he or
                    she starts lecturing us and trying to change the subject, we recognize a
                    potential “cover up,” trying to “fool us.” After a while we get to be quite good
                    examiners.</p>
                <p>This sort of example is applied all across the line. It isn't a straightforward
                    series of questions like, “What do you do if...?” It's really situations that we
                    put these people in—or opinions. We might ask, “Do you feel that the immigration
                    laws should be more strict and that fewer people should come to the United
                    States?” See how they handle this question. Maybe they know nothing about the
                    subject. They don't have to know anything about it. However, if they signed up
                    for the consular “cone,” they ought to know that visas and immigration are part
                    of that area. So you think that they know something. How do they formulate their
                    logic? Does their response cover the complexities of the immigration issue for
                    the United States? Again, they can't be held responsible for any given set of
                    knowledge. You hope that they have something there, and the written exam
                    hopefully brought out some of this. Does that answer your question?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very well. Do you remember any other questions that you
                        asked? What was your favorite opening salvo?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>MORGAN: My favorite opening salvo was always directed at making the candidate
                    feel at ease. Any Personnel Officer knows this. Obviously and by definition,
                    they're not “at home.” They're as nervous as they come. So what you want to
                    do—to get the best out of the individual and to see what the person is like—is
                    to set a relaxed tone to the interview, the exam—that's what it really is, for
                    both sides. You can't shout at them, “Relax!” That will only make them the more
                    tense. In those days we could know something of the person's background.</p>
                <p>Today, the examiners are not allowed to know anything. They know the sex of the
                    applicant, because that is obvious, and they might recognize their race because
                    those characteristics haven't yet been hidden from the examiners.. Otherwise,
                    they know nothing about the person's background. In our day we knew something.
                    We had read something about their university studies and we knew that they had
                    worked in other jobs. We would call upon their strengths from the beginning. We
                    might ask, “Tell us about your tour in Costa Rica in the Peace Corps. What did
                    you learn the most from that? What did you dislike about it?” That sort of
                    thing, because they're talking from their own experience. Then we would start
                    getting into specific areas of the exam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Demographically speaking, what were you looking for? I
                        suspect that 1973-1974 was not a very good time for young people to go into
                        government service. So, demographically, who were the candidates and what
                        were you looking for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: I would have to reject out of hand your suggestion that we were looking
                    for any particular candidates, from the demographic point of view. We saw young
                    people right out of university and older ones as well. After all, they were
                    people who had signed up for the oral exam, so they weren't going to come at us
                    in an aggressive way. There were a few exceptions. I think that there were a few
                    “weirdos” who got in. They may have felt that this was an opportunity for them
                    to talk back against all of the “evils” in society, and especially the U.S.
                    Government. We'd bid them a pleasant day after they started this approach, but
                    it was rare. We had people right out of university and an awful lot of
                    candidates from the Peace Corps. There were a lot of people from the military
                    who had had, perhaps, a tour in Germany for five years, or whatever. There were
                    a lot of candidates from teaching positions at the universities. We had a man—a
                    very distinguished gentleman 52 years old. He had run the space program at Cape
                    Kennedy, as it was called then; now it's again called Cape Canaveral. It was
                    mind boggling. He was a man who was a GS-17, or at least a very senior Civil
                    Service employee. He was coming in to be a junior officer in the State
                    Department!</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>But we did have older people. They always “sicced” me on them, as the Chairman of
                    that candidate's panel, since I had grey hair. I would ask them, “Do you really
                    know what you're doing?” That would be, of course, after they had passed the
                    oral exam. The chairman of that exam always discussed the successes and failures
                    (I should say “strengths and weaknesses!) of each of the candidates. We would
                    tell them why they didn't make it.. It was always stated in terms of “Why you
                    were not found as competitive as other candidates.” Then, on the other hand, we
                    would say in what areas they were found to be competitive. We couldn't say how
                    we had ranked them. You could say, “You did very well. The chances of your being
                    appointed to the Foreign Service are quite good.” But whenever the person was
                    older, we would ask, “Do you realize what it's going to be like, going down from
                    your senior position in the Civil Service to being a junior officer, “managing”
                    the toilets in the Embassy in Ouagadougou, with the Ambassador's wife on your
                    back all the time? Are you prepared for this?” This was a fair question. It
                    wasn't part of the exam. We just wanted to make sure that what they were walking
                    into was not going to be a surprise, because they would have to start at the
                    “bottom.” “No, you're not going to make Foreign Policy right away—if ever.”</p>
                <p>I think we did this in the oral exam itself with this man from NASA (National
                    Astronautics and Space Agency). I said, “You know, what brings you to the
                    Department of State?” He said, “You know, you can 'shoot the moon' just so many
                    times. And then you realize that, down here on earth, it's a lot more fun. I've
                    always wanted to travel. I'll always have a place in my heart for NASA. I've
                    learned more and more about what life is like in other countries. I'd like to
                    have a 'go' at it.” I said, “Well, you've only got nine years (or whatever it
                    was) before you're mandatorily retired.” We had to consider for employment
                    anybody, I think, who had five years left before mandatory retirement. That is,
                    anybody who was 55, because in those days the mandatory retirement age was 60.
                    In other words, there could be no discrimination based on age, with that one
                    caveat. If the person passed the exam, that was all there was to it. This guy
                    from NASA did pass the exam. He was terrific. He got one of the highest scores.
                    He has long since retired, because we examined him 20 years ago!</p>
                <p>Back to your opening question. The applicant had to be of a qualifying age, which
                    was 21 to 55, to take the written exam. If he passed the written and the oral
                    and was still under 55, we had to appoint him. We couldn't say, “You're going to
                    have a terrible time as a junior officer” and make this a basis for refusal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you looking for any one kind of person in particular
                        at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes, good officers.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you be a little bit more specific than that?</hi>

                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>MORGAN: No, because that was exactly what we were looking for. We wanted truly
                    competitive, good officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you absolutely gender, color, and age blind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: No, of course not. I'd argue no human can be, fully. But we had one,
                    overriding rule. We had a psychiatrist available who advised us, trained us, and
                    worked with us all the time. He helped us tremendously. The rule was, “Don't
                    hire in your own image.” What he meant by that was that it is only natural to
                    identify somebody in front of you as a candidate who is in your own
                    image—somebody who thinks, acts, and looks like you, is a male like you, is
                    white like you, and is all of those other things. We were all very conscious of
                    that.</p>
                <p>Also, we were very conscious that we did not have a proportionate number of women
                    and, above all, a proportionate number of minorities, especially blacks. We had
                    a few Asians, and the same was true with Hispanics. However, there were very,
                    very few African Americans. They didn't come to us. They either felt that the
                    Foreign Service wasn't “for them,” or their own backgrounds led them to more
                    lucrative opportunities. So, yes, when we had a Black or female candidate,
                    without “tilting” or varying the score, or anything else, we did our best to
                    make sure that the questions we put to them took into consideration the fact
                    that they weren't white, male, Anglo-Saxon, and from an Ivy League school.</p>
                <p>You might ask, “How do you do that?” Well, you don't do it under instructions
                    from higher authorities in the State Department. There were no—and I understand
                    that, as of very recently, there still are no—”instructions” on what to do with
                    “ethnic” or female candidates. However, if you're trying to follow the general
                    guidance of the Secretary of State and the United States Government, which
                    encourages “opening up” and “diversity,” and we found somebody from North
                    Dakota, we were cheered to see him or her.</p>
                <p>Now, do you “tilt” the examination? No. Do you recognize that maybe that person
                    hasn't been exposed to some of the things involved in foreign affairs which
                    somebody from Massachusetts has been exposed to? The highest scores which I ever
                    gave in my life were to two applicants from South Dakota, who had graduated from
                    a college with an unpronounceable name. But they knew a former Foreign Service
                    Officer who had retired, resigned, or whatever, and was heading the department
                    of foreign affairs in their college. He had turned out classes that were
                    incredible. These people were brilliant, I inferred from the candidates in front
                    of us. They had developed minds, personalities, and so forth. If I remember the
                    panel scores correctly—the oral game was given in Chicago—we gave them 100%.
                    This had never been done before. But they were just “mind boggling.” Were we
                    influenced by the fact that they came from South Dakota? Maybe subconsciously.
                    Maybe we were just very pleased to see two wonderfully turned out people from a
                    place from which no one had ever entered the Foreign Service, except Secretary
                    of State Warren Christopher. I think that he's from South Dakota.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q What about the lowest score? Do you remember ever being
                        “shocked” at the performance of one candidate? Did anybody ever “fall apart”
                        during an interview?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes. Whenever things like that happened, you did everything that you
                    could to get the person to relax and to bring out themselves. They would
                    “freeze.” They just couldn't answer the questions. There was absolutely nothing
                    wrong if candidates said, “I do not know.” That's fine. We would go on to
                    another question. This wasn't a “negative.” It was just that we would want to
                    get on to something else. Yes, there would be cases where people would “fall
                    apart”. I think that the answer to your question is that those who felt that
                    they were so good that they had to pass—those are the ones who “went to the
                    bottom.” That is, the arrogant ones—arrogance without substance. I mean, it's
                    something to be Henry Kissinger. There is something about arrogance without
                    competence.</p>
                <p>Some of the more “overly self-confident” candidates came from the School of
                    Foreign Service at Georgetown University. They had practically already seen the
                    exam. Some were “briefed” from the beginning. Some of the candidates who went
                    through that school, and a few others schools specializing in foreign affairs,
                    had been briefed on how to take the exam—what to do and what not to do. A
                    perfectly understandable thing to do. But too often these candidates walked in
                    to the exam and thought that they knew the examination procedure backwards and
                    forwards. Well, they didn't, in fact, because they didn't know the “mix” of
                    questions that day. They didn't know the importance to the examiners of
                    “balance” and “control,” of being able to handle your ego. And that's just being
                    a “know it all,” destined to be declared “not competitive”.</p>
                <p>Let me add one thing. As chairman of the panel, ultimately—at the end of every
                    single exam or at least at the end of every day, I was responsible for making
                    sure that the proceedings of every exam were written up correctly. “Correctly,”
                    in the sense of my viewpoint, since I had participated in it. I reviewed all of
                    the oral exams and gave the final score, which determined where they would go on
                    the register, the candidates listed by descending score order. I would base that
                    upon the recommendation from the oral panel and what their exam scores were. I
                    would “sum up” each candidate and do a very short accounting of the
                    performance]. In other words, what made them “viable” candidates and why. A
                    summary of their strengths and their weaknesses and if there were any questions
                    because then, if they were called up for appointment, they had to go through
                    medical exams, security clearance, and so on, as well as whether there were any
                    question of, for example, drug abuse. If these clearance procedures raised any
                    questions about possible ineligibility for appointment I would single those out
                    so that, when they did come out to be appointed, the Registrar would know which
                    questions had to be resolved. A person was not appointed to the Foreign Service
                    until he or she went through the whole process, which meant obtaining all
                    required clearances. In sum, that was my ultimate responsibility for those who
                    had signed up for the consular “cone.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you made your final evaluation, did you actually come
                        up with a numerical score?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: As I remember, the “numerical score” was agreed to by the oral
                    examination panel. I think that I accepted that number. I don't think that I
                    ever changed a number. However, the number could be changed if there were some
                    extraordinary reason for doing so. I mean, the “numerical score” of a person
                    could actually be reduced to 70, if there were some overriding reason, though I
                    can't think of any, off hand. I know that we did have some problems with drug
                    cases.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: That was when a person was addicted to drugs. I mean, seriously addicted
                    and who had “lied” to us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Addicted to what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Oh, heroin or something else that was serious. Not these “passing
                    fancies” such as smoking “pot” for a time. As a matter of fact if they claimed
                    “pure abstinence” in those days, we wondered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you remember finding out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Through the physical and security exams. Remember, they stayed in contact
                    with me or the Registrar until they were actually appointed. In other words,
                    they were part of the BEX (Board of Examiners) system, until actual appointment.
                    It's only then that they moved on to the Junior Officer Course at the Foreign
                    Service Institute.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So after someone, say, “passes” the oral exam...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: With an acceptable, competitive score.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, gets an “80.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then they are put on a roster.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: They are put on a register when they have 70 or above, and that list is
                    known only to the Registrar. Obviously, I could go in to his office and ask
                    about an individual's nearing the top of the list as persons would be taken off
                    the top for appointment. However, that roll or rank-ordering, can “move around.”
                    More importantly, you don't know how far down you're going to go on it. Everyone
                    is “on your back” to find out “when am I going to be appointed?” This is a
                    perfectly natural question. What if the Secretary of State decides that there
                    will be no more appointments this year? Then no one is taken off the register.
                    It is frozen, but newly examined candidates are place on that list, “frozen” or
                    not, in rank-order. What if somebody “falls out,” or quits, just as they're
                    about to be called up to enter the A-100 course at the Foreign Service
                    Institute? Then the Registrar reaches down and takes the next person on the
                    register, maybe put on but the day before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what did some of these people do while they were
                        waiting to be appointed? Did you ever get any “feedback” on that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Oh, yes. Very much so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were they doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Some of them were working on their master's degrees. Others had jobs.
                    Those were the ones that you heard from, other than the normally “anxious” ones
                    who wanted to know—and we tried to be as helpful but non-committal as we could.
                    We would say, “We can't tell you. We don't know.” Some of the decisions were
                    totally out of our hands, like how many are going to be appointed Foreign
                    Service Officers in a given year. There would be questions usually from those
                    who were facing a “date.” They would ask, “Should I start into my next
                    semester?” “Should I renew my commission as a Navy officer?” “Should I divorce
                    my wife?” Or whatever these “dates” are that are out there. They would call
                    Personnel, often just looking for information. They would usually call the
                    Registrar of the Board of Examiners and say, “I can't accept an appointment
                    before such and such a date.” They would be told, “Well, you do know that if you
                    don't want us to call you, you'll be taken off the register.” So they were
                    “feeling” their way out there, gambling in some cases.</p>
                <p>I would like to underscore that this is 1995, the date of our interview. I am
                    talking about 1975—about 20 year old procedures. I would like to think that it's
                    all the same. We know that the process has become much more restricted by
                    various influences which I call “inhibiting forces.” But that's because of
                    certain court decisions, and so on. Let me also mention something which was
                    going on then, in 1975, and which I didn't discuss but just alluded to. There
                    were a number of other programs going on.</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>One of them was a program for the appointment of Foreign Service wives who had
                    been forced to retire as FSOs when they married an FSO. I was in charge of that
                    panel. That included Phyllis Oakley, now a very successful reappointed FSO. I
                    think that we processed 38 reappointments applicants at the time. What they had
                    to do was simply to show that they had been active in those years when they were
                    spouses of Foreign Service Officers, which wasn't hard. Basically, they had to
                    write us a letter of application. They included how they had “added to their
                    credentials” in the intervening years since forced resignation. Then we would
                    assign them a Foreign Service grade. Let's say that they had left the Foreign
                    Service as an FSO-6 or an FSO-8. We would then have to consider what they would
                    have been if they had remained in the Foreign Service. They might be FSO-4's by
                    now or even an FSO-2. Could we reappoint them to that level? Probably not,
                    because we would have had to show that they indeed were doing all of the work
                    that would have gotten them to that level. On the other hand, the chances were
                    good of our giving them a higher grade than they had had when they left the
                    Foreign Service. I think that we had some explicit guidance, that they should be
                    reappointed to a level at least one grade higher. If they had been married, say,
                    to a Foreign Service Officer for 10 years, perhaps they would be reappointed to
                    a level two grades higher. An injustice had been righted, well, sort of.</p>
                <p>I also was chairman of our Equal Opportunity program geared to appointment to the
                    FSO corps if you were a qualified minority. The Equal Opportunity Office in the
                    Department of State referred cases to us. These applicants were screened by them
                    and us for academic credentials and other considerations. If they were found
                    eligible by the Equal Opportunity Office in the Department and BEX, we gave them
                    an oral exam—the same oral exam that we gave to all other candidates. However,
                    there is where we did “filter in” their differences of background. I will never,
                    ever, forget the case of an absolutely charming young woman. I think that she
                    was in graduate school, an African American from Howard University—or maybe she
                    was from Georgetown.</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>She was so charming and energetic and so wanted to pass the exam, which lasted
                    for two or three hours. In this event she couldn't find her competitive. We all
                    just sat there, absolutely silent. I was the chairman of the panel, and it
                    included a Black FSO examiner. Finally, I said, “We've got to decide. Let's do
                    it on paper.” Sometimes, we handled cases like this orally, or by nodding our
                    heads, because it was so obvious that it was a “failure” or a “pass.” Then we
                    negotiated the numbers on various parts of the exam. You wrote those numbers on
                    separate pieces of paper. The three examiners would write down their evaluation:
                    70, 72, or 73. Then we would average them. If one evaluation was 90 and another
                    was 70, then we had a discussion of a difference that great. Failure was 69. You
                    didn't have to go any lower. I think that, in this case, the three of us sat
                    there. We wanted to cry. We said, “She tried so hard, but she just doesn't have
                    it. She is not competitive. She hasn't demonstrated the skills today that, even
                    with special training and good leadership, she will within five years be
                    competitive with the non-minority entrants. That was the ultimate criterion:
                    would the candidate after five years stand a chance of competing with all FSOs
                    at that grade level.</p>
                <p>Remember, what we were doing in “passing” a person, we were putting them in
                    direct competition for the rest of their career with people who often were far
                    more qualified. Above all, in a society which is not fair and is not just in
                    many ways. Therefore, they need to have a special set of equipment to succeed.
                    We didn't want to send them into “turmoil,” or at least be a party to that.
                    Obviously, society was responsible, the “system” was responsible. This was not
                    necessarily well done, in terms of “on the line” supervisors who knew how to
                    handle this kind of case. They weren't trained to do this. We looked very
                    carefully, and with considerable compassion and understanding, at such
                    applicants..</p>

                <p>MORGAN: One consideration was the fact that she was exceptionally intimidated by
                    us. Much as we tried throughout the entire exam to get her to relax, it was
                    nearly impossible. In fact, you alluded to it before when you asked how we would
                    get people to relax. You do everything that you possibly can. She was always “up
                    tight,” so we weren't sure of who we really were interviewing. Then there was
                    the factual aspect. She couldn't handle many of the substantive and historical
                    questions—even those aimed at the society she knew best. We asked about how she
                    faced drug issues and how drugs affected society, for example. I had probably
                    read a newspaper article that day about a crime in the southeast section of
                    Washington, DC. We asked her how she would react to something like that—things
                    that she had to have feelings about. We were sure that she did have them, but
                    she couldn't express them.</p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>Then we went into hypothetical questions, as we called them. She went for the
                    tree with a sawed off limb, no matter what we put under it to help her. We
                    really wanted her to succeed, because she was so sweet. But sweetness does not
                    get you ahead in diplomacy nor in the competitive nature of the Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <p>Finally, I called her in and broke the news to her. She burst into tears and
                    said, “What will my grandmother say? My grandmother has spent my entire life,
                    pushing me ahead for this day.” Then I cried. It was very hard work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK. You only spent one year on the Board of Examiners. Why
                        only one year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: It's traditional. I asked for an extension, because I was as happy as can
                    be. I didn't see anything out there that seemed to be more interesting. However,
                    I was told, “Love to have you, said the boss, but no, this is a one year
                    assignment. Furthermore, you're going on to senior training. Consider yourself
                    honored.” Assignments of this kind of training are always made in a fairly
                    secretive way by a series of panels because senior training is a highly sought
                    after assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Why does a ticket have a hole in it? It says that it's honorable.
                    Correctly or not, assignment to senior training is a way of congratulating an
                    officer on what he or she has done so far. You have been found to be very
                    competitive. It's like a promotion—except it isn't, of course. Secondly, it's a
                    special experience. It's offered at various places. I went to the Industrial
                    College of the Armed Forces [ICAF], which is located at Fort McNair, along with
                    the National War College, now the National Defense University. Most of these
                    colleges are run by the military, and are really for the colonels and lieutenant
                    colonels—and captains in the Navy, and Air Force and Marines. In the case of the
                    military, an assignment to senior training is essential to future promotion.
                    They especially need to have their tickets punched in the right place. With us
                    in the Foreign Service it is a bit less important. About 10 percent of the class
                    members are civilians. They are drawn from government agencies. Most of the
                    civilians are Civil Service, although there were three or four FSO's at ICAF and
                    five or six FSO's at the National War College. In turn, the Army, Navy, and Air
                    Force all have war colleges. There's also one in Rome—a NATO Defense
                    College.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For our information can you tell us what senior training
                        is and what is ICAF, the Industrial College of the Armed Forces? What is its
                        purpose?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>MORGAN: Senior training involves a year of academic work. It is the equivalent of
                    being sent off to Cornell or other universities for area or specialized
                    training. It's a sabbatical, in a sense. You are taken “out of the system” and
                    given a year away from your normal duties. However, because it is so oriented
                    toward the national, defense, foreign affairs issues, clearly a “plus” has been
                    added to your overall skills. So when you come back from senior training, you've
                    had not only a nice, pleasant year—and not necessarily a relaxed one, because
                    you've got a lot of homework and study to do—but you've certainly leaned a lot
                    of contemporary topics and especially how the U.S. military face their
                    professions and how they look, from their vantage point, at numerous national
                    and international issues.</p>
                <p>ICAF, the Industrial College of the Armed Forces, was set up—I should remember
                    when it was. I think that it was set up after World War II, when we discovered
                    that we had a new war emerging, a Cold War against the Soviets. The U. S.
                    military and the Joint Chiefs of Staff discovered that, really, we had no
                    rearmament plan and were ill-equipped if we had to prepare for war.. We had most
                    limited ways of turning the economic mobilization machinery back on. Because we
                    did it and did it well with a war going on during World War II, but also at
                    great expense to the nation and “by the seat of our pants” in some cases, it was
                    thought that it would be a good idea to “get our act together” ahead of time. In
                    other words, we should be pro-active this time. It may also have had something
                    to do with the emergency created by the Korean War.</p>
                <p>So ICAF was organized, with emphasis on management skills. Modern technology had
                    come in, the computer had been “discovered,” and some of these hot, little
                    management gadgets had come in. I forget some of the “buzz” words, but we spent
                    a lot of time—and it was very useful—on plotting charts as you went through the
                    process. It was like a computer. You produced “Yes” and “No” questions—more or
                    less a schematic way of handling management questions. I know that we had
                    courses in economics and a tremendous number of military command post exercises.
                    We had one exercise that went on for about six months. I signed up for the
                    project dealing with the largest industry in the United States. You know what
                    that is?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Textiles?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: No. Medicine. The medical industry. We spent a lot of useful and valuable
                    time on this. We made field trips. By the end of the year we had produced a
                    “show and tell” program which took an entire day to present. This was all
                    “project oriented.”</p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>It was a tremendous experience to work with the military. I remember that on the
                    last day at ICAF a captain in the Navy came up to me and said, “Bill, I just
                    don't understand. I just knew that all State Department people were a bunch of
                    'wonks,' wore 'funny pants' and did all sorts of funny things. You're not like
                    that. I was pleasantly surprised at this. However, one thing that I still can't
                    reconcile myself to. I know that you're a fine American, you've done well, and
                    you're just as loyal as all of us Navy people. But why don't you wear a flag on
                    your lapel?” I said, “Captain, because I wear it in my heart.”</p>
                <p>It is this meeting and binding of souls, but particularly with the military. The
                    State Department often has a hell of a time understanding “the military mind.” I
                    got this so often when I was on the Soviet desk and in USRO, when I recounted to
                    you that these “misunderstandings” which we often had with these “energetic”
                    military people. This ICAF year helped considerably. There is another aspect,
                    and perhaps this is more important. This Navy captain understood that the State
                    Department people weren't a bunch of “commie wonks.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One question I didn't really ask you was that, during your
                        time in the Board of Examiners, Beirut, and ICAF the Vietnam War was going
                        on. I wonder if you could say whether there were any internal divisions in
                        the Foreign Service and in particular at ICAF, where you were surrounded by
                        military people. What role did the Vietnam War play and how were people
                        talking about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: We might start in the 1960's in Moscow. There was no question there. In
                    my own mind I had no question that the Vietnam War was an undertaking directed
                    by the Soviet communist world, which the French had “muffed.” With the little
                    knowledge I had and what I read and as I became more familiar with it, the
                    Vietnam War was seen to be a policy carried out by Presidents Kennedy and
                    Johnson. Now, having given my personal views from Moscow in the '60s, I think
                    that those of us in the State Department over the succeeding years would argue,
                    in various ways, about the methodology used [n fighting this war, especially as
                    it continued on and divided our nation. Nevertheless, there was never a question
                    in my mind about the ultimate reason for our being involved there.</p>
                <p>I don't remember ever hearing from any of my colleagues any questions about why
                    we were involved in Vietnam. What we were doing about it at a particular time,
                    how we were seeking truces or routes to peace obviously were always under
                    discussion. Whether Operation “PHOENIX,” for example, based on the bird that
                    arose from the ashes and then devoured, was questioned. That was a big program,
                    and there were questions about the CIA role in all of it. Remember, an awful lot
                    in the Foreign Service had served in Vietnam, or were going to serve there.</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>I came very close to being assigned as the Soviet specialist in the Embassy in
                    Saigon. Instead, they got my good friend, Roger Kirk, to go instead. He's never
                    forgiven me, I joke!. So the State Department had a big chunk of the action.
                    Those who didn't serve in Vietnam had colleagues and friends. Many with
                    experience there questioned our involvement there, especially after the bombing
                    of Laos. Again, there were questions about techniques or actual, individual
                    policies as they came up.</p>
                <p>Jumping from Moscow and the four years in the Department, to Beirut I don't
                    remember our involvement in Vietnam as being a vital issue among the people in
                    our Embassy or other Americans. Certainly, it was controversial. On the other
                    hand, we weren't out there giving lectures on the subject. In a sense, this was
                    a tragedy. Any of us who had any association with France and knew about the
                    French defeat at Dien Bien Phu and what it meant to the French developed a
                    certain feeling for the issue from that perspective. Remember, Lebanon had a
                    special tie to France. I always looked on Vietnam as being a “French-American”
                    problem. Not so much a continuation of an occupation by Westerners, because what
                    the Soviets were intending to do in Indochina was far more of an occupation of
                    that area. The question came up, “Why are we there?” The only answer that ever
                    came out was, “Because of expanding communism.” You saw that all over. You
                    didn't just have to look at Vietnam. So much of the Middle East conflict had
                    ties with Soviet involvement, often from an anti-American vantage point.</p>
                <p>Your question ends up at ICAF, and that's the place for it to end up. ICAF
                    students were very specific on this question because, sure, we talked about it.
                    The final evacuation of the American Embassy in Saigon took place in 1975. To
                    make a sweeping generalization and with my memory failing a little, as I have
                    admitted throughout this interview, I would say that discussions of Vietnam
                    while I was at ICAF were fine, open and honest. No meanness, no bitterness, no
                    remarks like, “You guys in the State Department lost the war.” There was nothing
                    like that, with only a few exceptions. As in all societies there were a few less
                    reasonable people at ICAF. However, they were pretty much isolated. There
                    certainly wasn't any “mood” there which you had to be concerned about.</p>
                <p>Oh, one of my State Department fellow students at ICAF might get together with me
                    for lunch, and he might say, “You've never heard what I heard today from this
                    Marine guy...” It was like that—an isolated thing. We were all fellow American
                    professional there to learn as much as possible, and from each other..</p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>I had a lot of office mates. You switched offices four times in the year. So you
                    had four different offices and four different groups of colleagues—four students
                    in an office. You got to know quite well more and more people in the class. I
                    never encountered any hostility. We were good friends and “buddies,” in the
                    normal, very close sense. Never did I encounter anything other than wonderful,
                    detailed, intelligent comments on life in the Foreign Service. Sometimes they
                    were emotional. We had discussions about the fall of Saigon at the end of the
                    war. That is, until the President Ford extended an amnesty to draft dodgers.
                    That really turned almost every single military person at ICAF against him. It
                    worked itself out, but for the first half of the course there was an incredible
                    amount of emotion. You could talk to them about it, but their reaction to the
                    amnesty reflected a high level of feelings, which was understandable. I must say
                    that I had contrary views on the topic, which I kept to myself from the very
                    beginning—for the first couple of days, at least. I thought that the amnesty was
                    something which had to be done, for the nation's sake, and it took great courage
                    to do it. As the weeks went by, we all could talk about it openly. However, at
                    the beginning, it was incredibly emotional, compared to the fall of Saigon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any other fond memories of ICAF?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: There are lots of them. They are better because they are more recent. It
                    was a marvelous experience. It brought together elements of the United States
                    Government. It made us proud and more knowledgeable. Yes, I do have a
                    conclusion, and a very practical one. When I left ICAF, I was assigned to the
                    Inspection Corps and then as Deputy Director of the Visa Office. I had never
                    experienced in my life a more direct transfer of learning to a job. In the
                    Inspection Corps, lessons learned at ICAF were immediately and dramatically
                    transferable. I knew more than the other inspectors about contemporary
                    management systems and methodology. I was asked to write the very first “manual”
                    on how to inspect a Consular Section. There had never been a consular-designated
                    officer with consular experience as an Inspector. I came right from ICAF to the
                    Inspection Corps. It was all so much a part of my “thinking” system in that
                    direct transfer It turned out to be the very skills that the Inspection Corps
                    was trying to inculcate into the Corps, the way they were going about inspecting
                    by contemporary analysis—they called it auditing in the business world, as they
                    started doing. I hear it's not the same, now, however.</p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>Then my assignment as the Deputy Director of the Visa Office was equally relevant
                    to these techniques I'd learned at ICAF. VO had just started considering
                    computer technology. It was the very first part of the State Department where
                    they were used in a real-world setting. And I was the Deputy Director primarily
                    responsible for saying, “Go ahead and do it.” That was very important. I
                    understood the value of computers in visa adjudication and control. ICAF had a
                    basic rule—and I recall that one of the professors said this: “The rule of this
                    school is to teach you so that you can 'talk back' to the people in management
                    or sales who are trying to 'con' you. They are trying to sell you a
                    sophisticated airplane when you need a Piper Cub.. They're trying to tell you
                    that the price is right. You're going to know as much as they do. We want to
                    teach you how to 'talk back' and “talk up” to them, and get the right facts, the
                    ones you need. Call them at their game.” And that's exactly what I brought along
                    to VO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One last question. Where was your family living while you
                        were “bunking up” with the guys at ICAF?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: They were right here when I was at Ft. McNair. We lived in
                    Alexandria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK. Your tours between 1975 and 1985 (VO, Paris and
                        Montreal) have already been covered in the first interview in 1988. We'll
                        skip now to 1985. You moved from Consul General in Montreal to be the
                        Director of Employee Relations in the Department of State. You got your
                        orders transferring you back to the Department, here in DC. What were your
                        feelings about it? Did you know that this would be your last assignment in
                        the Department of State?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes. Well, I wasn't told so, but I knew that it was very likely. I was
                    then 60 years old, and mandatory retirement was 65. Naivete should not by that
                    point be one of by qualities. Without going into a lot of detail, by then I had
                    been introduced to a series of obstacles that you had to cross that were both
                    humiliating and embarrassing. It was extraordinarily questionable whether senior
                    officers, as I was then, would get an additional three-year “extension” every
                    three years to keep you on the rolls. Without spending all of the 45 minutes we
                    have left on the tape to explain it—and it's all been changed slightly by now as
                    a result of various court cases—it was and is very complex. You began to realize
                    that the “system” wanted to get rid of you no matter how well you were
                    performing.</p>
                <p>So I had made up my own mind to retire, on my terms, when I left Montreal. I had
                    had a wonderful career. They tried to get me into a couple of Ambassadorial
                    slots, but they were not very interesting to me. So I said, “thank you very much
                    but no thanks.” I had more authority, “fun,” and power in the Consulate General
                    in Montreal and things that I was going to do than things in Belize or some
                    place out in the Indian Ocean whose name I've long since forgotten, where I
                    really would not have had much fun or challenge. My son, jokingly I think, said
                    I missed some good Club Med opportunities.</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>Certainly not in Belize where you were being supervised by an Assistant Secretary
                    of State who should have been in jail. I think that he's still fighting some
                    charge or another, was found guilty but pardoned, because of the things he got
                    involved in. Ollie North and all that He was a kind of Senator Jesse Helms type
                    who was involved in Central America. Well, Belize, here we come! No thank you.
                    So I decided to “pull up and wait” in some job in Washington. After all, we'd
                    been out of Washington for eight years. It was time.</p>
                <p>I'd been led very much to believe that I would be getting one of the three Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary of State jobs in the Bureau of Consular Affairs. Certainly,
                    I don't want to get into the emotion and to say, “So many people”—and I don't
                    like to think that I'm one of them—”don't understand how the 'system' works.”
                    Often, when some of these decisions are made, you take them personally, and
                    they're not to be taken personally. However, the person who was then the
                    Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs, Diego Asencio, told me that I had a
                    job as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs. He invited me
                    to come down from Montreal for a discussion. We had lunch together, and with our
                    wives, and talked about it. Then, the next thing that you know, the next day, he
                    went off as Ambassador to Brazil! This was a total surprise to me.</p>
                <p>Asencio was replaced by Joan Clark. I was led to believe that this assignment
                    still stood—that I would have one of two jobs, either Deputy Director in charge
                    of Visas or in charge of the protection of Americans. Joan came to Montreal
                    about a month later for a visit for one reason or another. It was made clear to
                    me that “we were going to talk about this assignment.” She never did. She had
                    her “hatchet man” talk to me about it. He never even said, “You're not getting
                    this or that job.” This situation went on for a couple of months, and I just
                    didn't understand. Naive?!</p>
                <p>A very dear friend, the Executive Director of the Bureau of Consular Affairs,
                    called me and said, “Bill, I don't think So and So made the situation as clear
                    as he probably should have. Well, you're not going to get any job in CA...you're
                    considered 'too senior.'”</p>
                <p>But there it was. Once a decision is made, and no more arguments are
                    welcomes—even though I considered it done in an evasive and unprofessional
                    manner—it's made, over. Then I realized that I didn't have a job. I thought,
                    “Well, they're not going to get me to retire now—I'm damned if they will.” Then
                    my good friend the Executive Director of CA said, “Bill, another mutual friend
                    wants you to join him in Personnel. He's the Deputy Assistant Secretary under
                    the Director General, Sam Lupo, and wants you in an Office Director's slot.” I
                    said, “Well, an Office Director job is not so important. After all, my ego would
                    be hurt.” He said, “No, Bill, it's a very good job. It's in Employee Relations.”
                    I said, “What? I've never even heard of Employee Relations.” He said, “Well, let
                    me ask Sam to call you and tell you about it.” Thus, one more example of how
                    assignments are made in State.</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>It turned out to be a superb job—an incredibly interesting one at that. Not only
                    was it a good job, it was one more insight into the “system.” I knew that I
                    wanted to retire. I saw what was out there in the Department and there was the
                    question of mandatory retirement. After this new assignment I'd be 62 and would
                    have the chance of sweating out one more extension of three years, but for what?
                    And also, the “system” was not as much fun. My wife and I had decided on a lot
                    of things that we were going to do in my retirement. It was time to get on and
                    into our new life while I was still healthy and, hopefully, sane and balanced.
                    And what about those grandchildren that were coming fast and furious?</p>
                <p>The job as the Director of Employee Relations itself was more interesting than I
                    ever expected. To approach it from a negative side, if that's the way to put it,
                    Sam Lupo said, “You will do everything that nobody else knows what to do with.”
                    I said, “What do you mean?” He said, “Well, we have our assignments system, we
                    have our promotions system, and we have our management system. We have all of
                    that, under the Director General of the Foreign Service.” This is the personnel
                    system of the Foreign Service and the Civil Service. Sam continued, “Everything
                    is designed nicely, but we don't know what to do—or the 'system' doesn't know
                    what to do—when some of these other things come up. For example, your first job
                    will be to head the State Department wide “United Fund Campaign.” I think it was
                    called the CFC (Combined Federal Campaign). I said, “You've got to be kidding.”
                    He said, “No, it will take up all of your time for a few months. The Secretary
                    of State, including his reputation in the Cabinet, is deeply involved in it.”
                    And he was! He was “chewed out” by the President and was embarrassed at a
                    cabinet meeting. The President roared at him that the Department of State wasn't
                    giving enough money to the CFC.</p>
                <p>So this job involved a lot of the odd ball things, where I was a sort of
                    “Ombudsman.” If somebody on the Grievance Staff didn't know how to handle or
                    couldn't handle something, I would do those things. I was partly involved in the
                    EEO (Equal Employment Opportunity) program. Health benefits. All aspects of the
                    health benefits program were handled there. Then, the two largest, established
                    pieces of the work of the office included, first, retirement. That was a big
                    operation, with about 40 Civil Service employees, run by Trudy Wikowski, who was
                    very competent and wasn't about to have a boss, so I was never accepted, by her
                    at least, as her supervisor. I ignored her “strength of character”, at least
                    bureaucratic, and had fun keeping involved in retirement issues, especially as
                    the retirement systems began to change.</p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>Additionally, when it came to retirement policy and practices issues, I was
                    inevitably involved. For example, when a person retires, he starts complaining,
                    “Where's my check, why didn't you do this, and I want to get a divorce.” All of
                    these things are out there, and they are all raised by curmudgeons of a “certain
                    age” who are bitching about what they're not getting, and, above all,
                    complaining that they didn't get a golden watch. They were forced to retire
                    earlier than they really should have and without an Ambassadorship. I felt
                    somewhat cynical and sarcastic about some of these complaints, but they all were
                    made by colleagues, albeit now departed. The Department wants its retirees to be
                    happy. Also, there were a lot of elements working against the retirement
                    program, like Congress and the Executive Branch, at times. They were trying to
                    “eat away” some of the benefits that you signed up for.</p>
                <p>In my first year I was also responsible for the “outplacement” or “job search”
                    program which grew considerably as the forced retirements skyrocketed. We'd had
                    a good week-long orientation program for some years. On to it was added a quite
                    effective job search, resum� writing program that gave a retiree a 90-day free
                    period to leave the Department—in lieu of a golden watch! But that was
                    “extracted” from ER, and made independently responsible to the Director General,
                    frankly, in my mind, because some in the system were worried that we had to
                    “upgrade” the process to make it seem more sensitive to the anger of many of the
                    forced, increased numbers of FSO retirees.</p>
                <p>Finally, just before I retired, in fact, we changed the whole retirement system.
                    FERS, the Federal Employees Retirement System, was voted by Congress to replace
                    the old Civil Service and Foreign Service programs... Those who were under the
                    old retirement systems could stay under it. However, we had to set up a computer
                    information system which told people whether it was “wise” to switch to the new
                    system—all that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>The other matter which was, by far, the biggest in terms of importance and
                    sensitivity, was Conduct, Discipline and Suitability for the entire Foreign
                    Service. In other words, this involved such issues for officers and staff of the
                    Foreign Service, when they misconducted themselves. This program was under my
                    office. Like the “little, black box” in SOV, we kept the ongoing, very
                    sensitive, very privileged, and very guarded records, which, for obvious
                    reasons, had to protect the integrity of the individuals affected. And also
                    there were zealous lawyers involved who were there to get the best they could
                    for their clients. The Director General and I handled this problem ourselves.
                    Whenever I found myself faced with a problem, I reported directly to him. In
                    turn, I had a deputy, George Haas, a superb Foreign Service Officer who was a
                    specialist in personnel matters, across the board. His “cone” was
                    Administration. He did a superb job. He had one staff person who handled all of
                    the files, phone calls, and so on.</p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>Bear in mind that we were involved in cases of misconduct ranging from the guy
                    who is accused of being a spy for the Soviets in Vienna, down to somebody who
                    was caught with 13 “pink slips” on her desk. A pink slip is what the Marine
                    Guards at a post overseas or security officers in the Department of State hand
                    out when an employee leaves classified information unguarded. But, of course, an
                    officer too often blames his secretary. We came up with discipline
                    recommendations against an established set of criteria covering everything from
                    the slaps on the wrist, suspensions for various lengths of time and up to
                    “termination” (dismissal of an employee). In criminal cases we referenced the
                    problem to the Justice Department. This involved, for example, stealing from the
                    government, money questions, serious violations of law, up to espionage. We had
                    a lawyer-advisor who recommended us most skillfully and carefully on such
                    cases.</p>
                <p>That obviously was one of the more interesting and challenging aspects of the job
                    and, in a way, most satisfying. You got through to the person involved. You
                    could really say, “Well, Charley, you really screwed up. We (the Director
                    General's authority and responsibility, under law) are going to put you off the
                    employment rolls for three days. It won't hurt you that much financially, but I
                    hope it hurts you personally and that you understand what is happening.”</p>
                <p>On my very last day in the State Department, the day of my retirement, I had a
                    phone call from a very dear friend. We won't name names now. “Bill, this job you
                    have is terribly important. You can't be retiring,” and all of this wonderful
                    “gas” between two old friends. He said, “Bill, while I have you on the
                    phone...”—which is obviously the reason why he called me—”we have this very
                    senior person in our bureau who is going over for some incredibly important
                    negotiations. You've put him off the employment rolls for a week.” I said,
                    “Well, let's get things right. I didn't put him off the rolls for a week. The
                    Director General of the Foreign Service did it.” He said, “Well, I know, Bill,
                    but you have a lot of influence over him, and this guy is very important.” I
                    said, “Now, come on, we know that there is somebody else who can go out and do
                    that job. You could do it yourself.” He said, “Oh, no, I couldn't do it—I have
                    other things to do.” I said, “Look, we can't cancel this suspension for a week,
                    because what he did is very serious.” He said, “Well, I don't know the details
                    about this matter. I don't need to, and there is no reason for you to interfere
                    in what has been decided.” I said, “OK, let me just say this to you. We're not
                    going to talk about the details, but I will tell you this much. The real bottom
                    line is that he had a bundle of TOP SECRET documents as he was sitting in the
                    barber chair in his neighborhood. Unfortunately, the guy seated in the next
                    barber chair was an FBI agent—just by happenstance. He saw this material. If you
                    and I wanted to help this guy out, we couldn't do it.” That was my very last act
                    in the Department.</p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>I left the Department happy. I went away from a career very satisfied that I'd
                    done some things worth while and professional. Another friend of mine who has
                    just retired too early said, “Bill, I'll never forget your advice years ago.
                    'Never leave mad'.” I didn't leave mad. There were few reasons to do so—not many
                    for me at all. Oh, the ego is hurt once in a while, or something that we believe
                    in didn't work. However, I think that, maybe, one of the most important lessons
                    of the Foreign Service is, how do you live with defeats? How do you live with
                    situations in which you lost the argument or you lost funds you need to do the
                    right job? I always prided myself that I could always find the resources needed,
                    somewhere else. That was part of the game. That was what kept me happy. How do
                    you “fight” the System, in the best sense of the word? How do you “use” it to
                    get what you know is right for the nation? When you don't get what you want,
                    well, you get over it. That helped me through it, as it did friends and
                    colleagues, but I certainly didn't leave mad. I was very happy.</p>

                        always go back and do some more if necessary. Thank you very much for all
                        five tapes of your time.</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You really put a very human face on what sounds like a
                        very bureaucratic organization. So thank you very much.</hi>
