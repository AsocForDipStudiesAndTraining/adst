                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an interview with Harry I. Odell taken by Peter
                        Moffat on April 17, 2000. Tell us a little bit about your background.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ODELL: As far as foreign service is concerned, I don't think I had any lifelong
                    burning desire to be a Foreign Service officer. I don't think I knew there were
                    such things until World War II when a fellow I knew in the Army Air Corps had a
                    brother who was a Foreign Service officer. He used to get letters from his
                    brother and he talked about it a bit. I subsequently met my friend's brother.
                    That was what first attracted my attention. After World War II when I was still
                    an undergraduate at Brown, I really had no clear vision of what I was going to
                    do. I was quite concerned about my age, which being in my late 20s seemed to me
                    to be enormous at that time. I had to do something in a hurry. I considered law
                    school. I think I could have gone to law school. That seemed another three years
                    or something after finishing up. Then when I was at Brown, one of my government
                    professors also taught up at the Fletcher School in Medford. He wondered if I
                    would be interested in going there. Since I hadn't made up my mind what I was
                    going to do, I said, “Well, alright.” It was just at that juncture that the
                    written exam for the Foreign Service (This was in September 1948.) was being
                    given, so I decided to take the written exam, which I passed. By this time, I
                    was in graduate school at the Fletcher School, so it just came naturally that I
                    took the oral exam the next spring and passed that.</p>
                <p>At that time, one of the Department's endemic budget crises was upon them and we
                    were all told, “Congratulations. You passed the exams. It will probably be 18
                    months before we can give you a commissioned appointment. Go find a job
                    someplace and we'll get in touch with you.” I didn't know what to do for a job
                    and by this time, my wife and I had almost totally run out of money. What little
                    we had, we spent going out to California and back after I finished at
                    Fletcher.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>So, I came back and had to do something, so I came down to Washington. I had a
                    couple of names, including the brother of this fellow that I had met in the
                    Army, Fraser Wilkins, who subsequently became ambassador to Cyprus. I saw
                    Fraser, but, of course, he couldn't do anything for me at the time. I remember
                    going to the old Virginia Avenue 21st Street entrance to the Department and
                    sitting there and looking through a Department of State telephone book. Of
                    course, security was nothing like what it is now. I just was going through it. I
                    saw that in the Bureau of European Affairs, they had a section called “Policy
                    Reports.” I had no idea what they did up there, but I went up and introduced
                    myself. The fellow in charge said, “Well, what we do here is, each day, we
                    summarize cables and stuff that have come in and put a little summary memo on
                    the assistant secretary's desk when he comes in in the morning. Then, if he
                    wants to see the other cables, he can. Frankly, sometimes, he reads our summary
                    and sometimes he doesn't, but that's what we do. Once a month, we do a broader
                    summary and we do ad hoc things. But I don't need anybody in my office. Down in
                    Far East (FE), Sharp Noddler, who is in charge down there, was telling me the
                    other day that he needed somebody.” So, I went down there and talked to Sharp.
                    He said, “Well, these are all Civil Service positions here. This is a P2
                    position. For me to hire you, I'd have to certify that all these candidates that
                    have come up from the Civil Service Commission system don't meet my standards.”
                    So, we kicked that around for a while and he finally decided that none of these
                    people would meet his standards and he so certified and hired me. It was a
                    different world in those days. Of course, I had done very well on the written
                    English part of the FSO exam. So, I went to work there as a P2.</p>
                <p>I hadn't been there for more than a couple of months when I got a phone call from
                    Personnel saying that there was a new program. The Department of State was
                    taking over responsibility for the government of occupied Germany. They were
                    converting from a military government to a high commission. They were going to
                    staff positions in Germany that had been held by military government officers
                    with State Department people. Some of these military government officers were
                    just going to convert from Department of Army to the State Department. Somebody
                    had the bright idea (or what they thought was a bright idea) of “Let's get some
                    of these fellows waiting to become Foreign Service officers and send them over
                    there.” I said, “Well, it sounds interesting, but I've just gotten started here
                    and I like my job. My wife has just gotten pregnant and we've just finally found
                    an apartment. I don't know.” They said, “Well, what are you getting paid?” I
                    said, “Well, $3,000 some.” They said, “We pay $5,300 as an FSS 7.” I said,
                    “Where are you?” They said, “The Walker Johnson Building.” So, I went over and
                    was interviewed there. One point that came up was, I had been a prisoner of war
                    in Germany during World War Iwould this cause me any problems one way or the
                    other? I said, “No,” of course. That was it. Then we gathered in December, 27 of
                    us, and stayed at the institute until March, studying German and getting
                    lectured on mostly sociology. There was very, very little about what we might be
                    encountering in our jobs or the all important thing of our relationship with the
                    American army rather than with the Germans. There was practically none of
                    that.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>Then we went to Germany and stayed for two years. This was in 1950. In November
                    of that year, my FSO 6 appointment came through and I got a diplomatic passport
                    and a salary cut of $600 a year and became a Foreign Service officer.</p>
                <p>In Germany I was a so-called “Kreis” officer. Kreis can mean either “circle” or
                    “district.” It was sort of like counties in this country. It was at that level
                    that we were assigned, converting from military government. By the time we got
                    there, the real authority legally was still there, but in practice, there was
                    very little power left. The Germans had by that time pretty much started running
                    their own affairs up to a pretty high point. So, we had a mandate to try and
                    help them become better democrats and so forth. There were a number of programs
                    already in place that we were supposed to help implement, such as a schools
                    program, community action programs, and so forth. There would be people with
                    supposed substantive knowledge in these things at our headquarterin Munich in my
                    case. I was in Bavaria. Then we were supposed to implement these programs and so
                    forth. Up to a point, we did try. We were totally dependent on the American Army
                    for logistical support. The State Department budget had been taken over from the
                    Army. Such things as housing was still handled by the Army Quartermaster Corps.
                    Our vehicles were serviced by the Army. Our housing was assigned and maintained
                    by the Army. The Army, being the Army, kind of went about its business. Although
                    generally you didn't have any bad relations with the Army, if you wanted... I
                    was transferred partway though my first assignment from a very remote and rural
                    area to a more urban area in Bavaria and there happened to be an armored cavalry
                    regiment stationed there. There, I found that a lot of my job was functioning as
                    the civil affairs officer for the Army. We had certain functions equivalent to
                    being a justice of the peace in this country. If there was a German who broke an
                    occupation law or an American violated a German law, both categories came before
                    us in the first instance as a convicting magistrate, if you will. If there was
                    anything serious, you simply found whoever was involved, an American who had
                    violated German law, but Americans couldn't be tried in a German court at that
                    time; or a German who had violated our law. There was always something going on.
                    The Army soldiers would get in trouble in one way or the other. I found that a
                    very interesting part of the job. Again, the Department of State was not
                    terribly helpful in 1) giving us clear guidelines as to how to function in this
                    capacity and 2) making certain that the Army through its own channels told its
                    people down the line who we were and what they should expect from us and how
                    they should behave towards us. You were pretty much on your own. Some people had
                    a lot of trouble with the Army. I didn't, partly because of my wife, who hit it
                    off very quickly with the wife of the regimental commander there, a woman who
                    was considerably older than my wife. They hit it off and then somehow the word
                    trickled down through all the channels that we were fairly reasonable people. If
                    Colonel Brown saw fit to think that we were alright, why, then everybody did. It
                    worked out pretty well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who did you report to back in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>ODELL: We didn't report directly back to Washington at all. We reported through
                    Commission headquarters in Munich. The reporting was essentially parochial
                    domestic. We didn't do any...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who would write your efficiency report?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ODELL: We had a district boss who had perhaps six or eight of us under him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a Department of State employee?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ODELL: He was then, but the fellow I worked for had been a Department of the Army
                    civilian. That was another thing. They had never seen these forms before. They
                    didn't quite know what to say and so forth. It was a particularly interesting
                    thing. This happens to be the 50th anniversary of that group getting together.
                    Although we weren't officially a Foreign Service officer class, we always
                    considered ourselves to be one. We all went to the same country, which I think
                    was unique in the history of the Foreign Service. We have remained quite close
                    ever since. We're having our 50th anniversary this next month here in
                    Washington, those of us who have survived. We've kept in touch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who among your group achieved particular fame?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ODELL: Talcott Seelye was in my group; Bob Dean; Spike Dubbs, who was killed in
                    Afghanistan; Jock Dean. I think they are the ambassadors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's interesting how many of those names left Germany
                        behind and went on to other...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ODELL: I was somewhat different. My third assignment was back to Germany, first
                    to Hamburg and then to Berlin for two years. The same thing happened to Walter
                    Jenkins. He went out to Taipei and then came back to Germany in Berlin. Jock
                    Dean, I think, stayed in Germany. Although Jock was in the Congo once, he spent
                    much of his later career involved in German affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, all good things come to an end. You had to go back
                        to the Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>ODELL: No. I went to Haifa, Israel as vice consul. In my wish list, I had said
                    “the Middle East.” I had no idea I would be sent as vice consul to Haifa. It
                    turned out to be quite an interesting assignment. I got there in 1952. That was
                    four years after the creation of Israel. It was an interesting period to see the
                    changes taking place administratively in Israel. Manifestly, even in that short
                    period of time in two years, administratively, things were working better than
                    they had when I got there. Four years after the British gave up their mandate,
                    they were just sort of beginning to get ordinary government service and
                    facilities under control, in addition, of course, to coping with an enormous
                    immigration problem, a military problem, and every other kind of problem. As a
                    consulate, particularly in a port city, a provincial city, you didn't see the
                    big picture as much as you saw the mechanics of the thinthe mail being delivered
                    and the garbage being collected, conventional police work and so forth. It was
                    interesting to see that movement take place in Israel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ODELL: Our first ambassador to Tel Aviv, who I think I met once, died of a heart
                    attack and then he was replaced by Francis Russell, whom I saw more because he
                    preferred Haifa physically to Tel Aviv and used to come up more than we wanted
                    him to. I did see more of him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And your consul general was who?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>ODELL: When I got there, it was a fellow named Wilbur Chase, who had been in
                    Hamburg. He was a consular type and stayed one. Wilbur was there and then he
                    went on extended home leave. I was in charge of the consulate the last three
                    months or so. It was a pretty good period. Things were fairly austere. It was
                    difficult to get things and things didn't work very well. There were constant
                    power failures and that sort of thing. But things got better. Of course, in
                    those days, with a diplomatic passport, you could cross the Lebanese border or
                    the Jordanian border with no trouble at all, so we made a routine of going up
                    periodically to Beirut and coming back with a car just absolutely bogged down
                    with everything you can think of. It was not an unpleasant experience in Haifa.
                    My son was born there. We found it very agreeable, although I had no idea of
                    that assignment coming up. It was particularly interesting because... Talcott
                    Seelye at the time was over in Amman. He knew from the word “go” that he wanted
                    to be an Arab specialist. He and his wife and children came over to Israel
                    twice. This was very rare of an Arabist in those days. They tended to avoid
                    Israel like the plague. Talcott didn't. He had his strong views, which he still
                    holds, but he came over. We visited them in Amman. Of course, Jerusalem was
                    there in between. It was an interesting place to be. I got to know people that I
                    still know. We traveled quite a bit. We went up to Damascus; Amman two or three
                    times; Beirut several times (We didn't get to Cairo.); up to Cyprus, which was
                    still British... We were there the night they were celebrating the coronation of
                    Queen Elizabeth. Some official Americans assigned to Israel, if they were going
                    to have children, the wife would go over to Cyprus or someplace and have this
                    child rather than have it born in Israel. My son was born in Haifa and my wife
                    said, “I'm not going over to Cyprus. I've been going to this doctor here and I
                    want to stay here.” When his passport was issued, the place of birth said
                    “Haifa, Israel.” He carried this with him. His passport to this day says he was
                    born in Haifa, Israel. After he grew up, he traveled all over the place,
                    including all through the Arab world. There was a lot of mythology connected
                    with this.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You then returned to Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ODELL: I was first assigned to the consulate general in Munich. While I was on
                    home leave, I got a telegram saying, “Don't go to Munich. Go to Hamburg.” This
                    always stuck in my mind. I wrote the usual letter to him saying how absolutely
                    delighted I was that I was going to work for him and so forth. I got a letter
                    back from him saying, “Thank you very much for your letter. I will be delighted
                    to have you on my staff, but I can't imagine what you'll be doing because there
                    is no vacancy here.” Then it was about a week later that I got a telegram from
                    the Department saying, “Don't go to Munich. Go to Hamburg.” So, I went to
                    Hamburg and was not terribly happy there because I was, of course, put in the
                    Visa Section, which was a very, very busy visa section in those days (the spring
                    of 1955). Hamburg was a nice city and there was lots to do there and everything,
                    but the job was just visa applicants. You would be there and again it would be
                    filled with visa applicants and so forth. So, when the opportunity came, I was
                    asked would I be interested in transferring to the job in Berlin. That didn't
                    take me very long to say “Yes” to.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>I went to Berlin and that was a good assignment. I was assigned to the Economic
                    Section and was assigned specifically to Berlin. In those days (1955), it was a
                    few years after the airlift and everything. They were still thinking of what was
                    going to happen to Berlin. My specific job was to try and keep track of traffic
                    in and out of Berlin and also airlift planning. They were planning in case there
                    was another airlifstockpile planning and so forth. They had the Kommandatura
                    structure in Berlin at that time. Although it didn't have any real power, it
                    still met and they had subcommittees. One of the fringe benefits I got was that
                    I was assigned to this subcommittee dealing with these matters. I had a British
                    colleague and a French colleague, both of whom were full time civil servant
                    types who stayed there since World War II. They both spoke fluent German. Our
                    German colleague, ex officio, in the group (Of course, the Germans were paying
                    for the thing.) didn't speak anything except German, so they had fallen into the
                    practice of talking entirely in German. It didn't take very long for me to
                    realize that it wasn't going to work. I knew some German from my previous German
                    experience. I had kept up with it a little bit in Israel, but it wasn't by any
                    means fluent. I decided right then and there that I was going to have to work at
                    this. It's the old story: if you're forced into a situation of using a foreign
                    language, it begins to... After a while, I discovered one day that I was
                    beginning to at least in that context think in German rather than in English.
                    That was a real big fringe benefit of that job. It made life after that in
                    Germany much more pleasant. Subsequently, much later on in subsequent posts, it
                    was much more pleasant. That was an interesting period.</p>
                <p>I met Chuck Johnson during that period. He was a civil servant when I first met
                    him. He was sort of staff assistant to Eleanor Dulles, who was special assistant
                    to the secretary for German Affairs. Eleanor used to come out to Berlin
                    periodically. She was a GS 14 at the time, maybe a 15. She was treated with a
                    considerable amount of deference. Chuck came out with her. I think that was the
                    first time I met him. He was still in the Department. Subsequently, I was
                    assigned to be her assistant and discovered that Eleanor really had some rough
                    edges on her, no doubt about it. But basically, she was quite nice underneath
                    it. We got along quite well. I enjoyed that because running around with Eleanor
                    got me into meetings with people that I at my level at that point would have
                    never been in otherwise.</p>
                <p>Bernard Guthrie was one of our chiefs. He was a senior State Department official.
                    At that time, the structure was complicated. The British, American, and French
                    ambassadors in Bonn were the chiefs of mission in Berlin. Their official
                    deputies were generals. The general's deputy, if you will, was Mr. Gussler. In
                    practice, Gussler dealt with directly with the Department of State and so forth.
                    But that relationship with the Army in Berlin was a lot of fun. The Army put its
                    best foot forward there. The officers seemed to have been carefully picked.
                    General Dasher told me at one time that he had a lot of authority when it came
                    to officers being assigned there. If he got the word that somebody wouldn't fit
                    in very well, he could say “No” to them. The first were sharp troops. There were
                    lots of good parades. It was Berlin; of course, the Germans put on a good show
                    there. Berlin was full of good things to do. It was cheap and not crowded and it
                    wasn't full of tourists. We thoroughly enjoyed Berlin.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>That was an interesting period. Willy Brandt was on his way up. at that point.
                    Again, my wife got to meet Mrs. Brandt at some kind of function. They took the
                    children to circuses and things like that and I got to know Willy before he
                    became a great man. He didn't become mayor until later, but he was really on his
                    way up. It was during that period that there were a couple of incidents. The
                    riots took place in Poznan, Poland at that time. There was a spillover into
                    Germany and East Berlin. Willy Brandt came to the fore. Chuck Johnson and I went
                    down. Chuck by that time had been assigned to Berlin. He and I went down to the
                    Rathaus, where they had a big rally and Willy got up and spoke to the crowd and
                    calmed them down. From them on, his political star was in ascendance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, what happened then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ODELL: After Berlin, I was sent to Bonn in the Economic Section and I really knew
                    very little about economics. I did economic studies at Harvard in 1957 1958. It
                    was then called the Littauer Center. I subsequently became the head of the
                    school, much to the unhappiness of Mr. Littauer's descendants. That was a good
                    year. There wasn't much pressure on. I met some interesting people and heard
                    some interesting lectures and stuff. But it did mark me as an economic officer.
                    I took a couple of assignments before the Department finally agreed with me that
                    I really wasn't that much interested in economics and wasn't all that good at it
                    to begin with.</p>
                <p>After that, I came down to the Department and was in the old Bureau of Economic
                    Affairs in the Aviation Division for just a year. Then they created a new
                    bureau, which was called CU. This was the old CU. I think there is a new one
                    noCultural Affairs. But at that time (This was when USIA was quite
                    different.)implemented these programs abroad and the American side of these
                    programs was handled in the Department of State. But it created this new bureau.
                    They brought together the various exchange programs, the Fulbright Program,
                    various cultural activities, and so forth. They were looking for a staff
                    assistant. I was on the list of the Secretariat at that time to work up there. I
                    got a call from the Secretariat, saying, “Would you like to work in CU?” I
                    didn't know what that was. They said it was as staff assistant. They said, “Now
                    you're drawing a GS 13 salary down in the Economic Bureau. This is the GS 14
                    slot.” I said, “Yes, sure. I'll be right over.” So, I went over and did that
                    until the administration changed. Mr. Kennedy came in and a new political
                    assistant secretary for CU was appointed. He had his own man that he wanted in
                    that position and I was due for reassignment anyhow. (tape turned off)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With aviation and CU behind, could you tell us a little
                        bit about the major issues and what was going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>ODELL: In the Aviation Division, the chief issue was that this was 1958. By that
                    time, the aviation world had changed. After World War II, the United States and
                    to a lesser extent Great Britain, had all the airplanes and all the know how and
                    all the power. Whatever we wanted was pretty much what we got. We had a
                    conference in Bermuda which we pretty much dominated and established certain
                    principles governing international civil aviation called the Bermuda Principles.
                    In practice, it meant pretty much that what our CAB said went. By 1958, there
                    were a lot of other countries coming along who had their own airlines, most of
                    them state owned and controlled. Ours were not, which added another complication
                    because we dealt with them and they were private American corporations, but they
                    had to go through the U.S. government because, in contrast to most corporate
                    activity, civil aviation on the international level was subject to government to
                    government agreement. The Department of State, of course, had to negotiate with
                    the airlines and with the CAB and with the foreign government, so there was a
                    lot of negotiation going on, much of it unofficial. But along came these other
                    countries, most of whose airlines were state owned or state controlled and they
                    wanted a piece of the pie. They were not interested in being told that the
                    economics of a given situation should be German. Obviously, the American market
                    was the most important market in the world and our view was (and I think it was
                    basically sound) that to get access to the American market was very important to
                    an airline from Argentina, in return for which they ought to be very free with
                    landing rights for our airplanes. They shouldn't impose any restriction really
                    on us of the number of flights we could operate. Certainly, being able to fly
                    into our country meant a great deal more to them than for us flying to
                    Argentina. But they didn't see it that way and they would say, “Well, Thursday,
                    Pan American can land three times. Friday, they can land two” or something like
                    that. We would say, “No, no. Let's leave that up to Pan Am. If they think it's
                    worthwhile to fly six times on Thursday and eight times on Friday, they ought to
                    be allowed to do that. That is in your benefit “ (end of tape)</p>

                <p>ODELL: This was 1961 that I went to Sri Lanka. There had been a very few years
                    before that some serious “communal disturbances,” community disturbanceTamils
                    and Sinhaleswhich had taken very unpleasant forms, but they hadn't created a
                    national crisis that caused a great deal of trouble. In the circles in which we
                    moved in Colombo, the educated well to do professions that we tended to know,
                    civil servants, senior civil servants, and so forth, and the club we belonged
                    to, the Eighty Club, which I think was probably the best club in Sri Lanka (I
                    joined to play tennis primarily.), Tamils, Sinhalese, and Burkers were the
                    Eurasians there mingled freely on the social level. They planed tennis together
                    and had dances together and parties together and so forth. You didn't sense
                    much, except that marriage between those groups was very, very rare indeed.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>Quite a few of the people at that level were at least nominally Christians rather
                    than Hindu or Buddhist. The religion was a kind of blanket that covered them to
                    some extent, but it was very rare for them to marry. I still have friends whom I
                    haven't seen in years, but they spend part of their time in London and the rest
                    of the year in what's now Sri Lanka. He is a Sinhalese, a very good family, and
                    she is a Tamil. I think they were the only couple that we knew that somehow
                    bridged that gap. To answer your question, we didn't see much actual
                    trouble.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was our ambassador at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ODELL: Frances Willis. You've heard of her. She was a career officer, of course,
                    and she was our first minister at that time to Switzerland. Then when we raised
                    the legation to embassy rank, she became the first ambassador. Then she was
                    subsequently ambassador to Norway and then her sort of retirement post was Sri
                    Lanka. That was a good thing for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever know her?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ODELL: No. She's dead a number of years now. She was one of the genuine brains
                    that I met in the Foreign Service. I met a lot of very bright people, but she
                    was in her 60s at the time. She doesn't seem all that old to me now, but did
                    then. She was bright and very demanding. She could have quite a ploddy demeanor
                    that some people didn't like. But she had a great capacity for going to the
                    heart of an issue. I found her very helpful in the sense that she could sense
                    what you were getting at very quickly, sort of like a good editor helping
                    somebody write something. At least with me, she could sense what it was.I was
                    fortunate professionally in Colombo that I had been kind of bumping along and
                    the job was not terribly exciting. Having to write about tea and all and
                    rubber... We didn't have a great deal of interest. We had a fairly large AID
                    mission. I never quite understood how the AID mission had gotten to be that
                    substantial in Ceylon, but it was a big one. The first thing was, Miss Willis
                    decided that she wanted to keep the AID mission director kind of at arm's
                    lengtfor whatever reasons, I don't know. She wanted me as her economic officer
                    to be the one that kept in touch with the AID mission and kept her informed as
                    to what they were up to, which was not easy because they were up to all kinds of
                    things. That was the first thing. I had to report to her on what they were
                    doing.</p>
                <p>This got me involved with the AID mission director Jack Bennett, who had been a
                    fairly senior guy in the Treasury at one time. I don't know how he ended up in
                    AID, but I think that was Jack's retirement post somehow. He and I got along
                    fairly well. I told him, “Jack, the best thing I can do for you is, you are
                    persuaded that your AID mission is doing good thinglet me see as much of it as
                    you possibly can. I'm not a spy, but Miss Willis is asking me questions every
                    day.” So, he arranged for me to go with all of his field officers to every damn
                    thing they were doing, which got me all over the island. I saw all sorts of
                    things, which was fun.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>But the big thing that happened in Colombo was that Senator Hickenlooper attached
                    an amendment to the AID appropriations bill or something. It said in substance
                    that any foreign government that nationalizes, seizes, American property and
                    doesn't provide adequate, prompt, and effective compensation shall not have a
                    USAID program there. We would suspend the AID program. Well, at that time in
                    BraziI think it was one of the federal states of Braziwas giving IT&amp;T a very
                    hard time. Of course, nobody wanted to suspend the AID program to Brazil. It was
                    a big operation down there. But the Ceylonese in their wisdom decided to
                    nationalize American Oil Company. There was no oil in the ground as far as I
                    know, but there were two American marketing companies, STANVAC and CALTEX. They
                    split half the market and British Dutch Shell had the other half. Well, they
                    decided to nationalize these marketing operations. They sold the gasoline and
                    the diesel fuel and the kerosene and so forth on the island. They set up Ceylon
                    Petroleum Corporation. To give the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation facilities, they
                    nationalized all these gas stations, storage tanks, and distribution facilities.
                    Well, they didn't provide prompt, effective, and adequate compensation. As I
                    say, nobody really wanted to move in on the Brazilians, but here was Ceylon up
                    there. You could do anything you wanted to with Ceylon and that wouldn't cause
                    any particular trouble. So, we suddenly from being a fairly obscure place
                    started getting an awful lot of attention. Boy, the oil company, figuring that
                    this was setting a precedent, their high powered brass from London, Amsterdam,
                    and New York were out there all the time, coming and going. The U.S. government
                    got very much interested, too. We were constantly being visited by people. So,
                    just fortuitously, being the economic officer, I was it. I started dealing
                    directly with Frances Willis and this became our prime occupation for close to
                    two years. This was about what we did. That was very enjoyable.</p>
                <p>It ended up, of course, by suspending the AID program, finally deciding that they
                    hadn't provided the prompt, effective, and adequate compensation, although they
                    kept saying they were going to and I believed that in their own way they fully
                    intended to do this, but they were going to get around to it sometime next year
                    or something. So, we suspended the AID program, closed the whole thing up, and
                    sent everybody home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the reaction of the Ceylonese authorities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ODELL: It was a very interesting reaction. I remember the day I went down with
                    Ambassador Willis. The final word had come through that there was going to be no
                    further reprieve and “You are hereby instructed to go down and tell the foreign
                    minister that as of midnight or something, he is going into the gas chamber.” I
                    remember going down there and Francis saying, “Oh, dear.” So, we went in and she
                    told him and put a formal note on his desk. We sat there for a moment and he
                    said to her, “Is there anything else?” She said, “No.” He said, “Well, thank you
                    for coming” and rang his own bell. An assistant came in and he said, “See that
                    the ambassador's car comes around, please” and down we went. That was his
                    reaction.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>But then, the Ceylonese press picked it up. There was an official statement from
                    the government saying how terrible this was and so forth. But I went that
                    evening to play tennis at the Eighty Club. Here was the foreign minister's
                    assistant there and nobody said anything. We played tennis as usual and
                    everything went on.</p>
                <p>Relations got a little chill; there is no doubt about that. I think I have to
                    backtrack. I think it was just before we did this when relations were getting
                    kind of difficult. The prime minister was a woman, Sirimavo Bandaranaike, the
                    widow of the man who had been assassinated. Just before Christmas, it didn't
                    occur to us at the time, but the ambassador came in and said that she had been
                    invitenot summoned, but inviteby the prime minister to come to her residence
                    that afternoon. If the ambassador would like to, she could bring Mr. Odell with
                    her. I said, “What is all this about?” She said, “I don't know, Harry. I think
                    that maybe they're going to break diplomatic relations with us or something.” We
                    didn't know. Whenever it was, relations were very funny. We rarely saw the prime
                    minister directly except on social occasions. She dealt with us through her
                    foreign minister. We got over there to her official residence and came in. The
                    prime minister greeted the ambassador and then nodded at me. She said, “We've
                    been kind of quarreling with each other lately. I thought we all ought to have
                    some Christmas cake together.” So, we sat down. Some of her personal staff came
                    in and we had tea and Christmas cake. Then we went home. That was all there was
                    to it. We didn't discuss any business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there some coup or coup effort?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>ODELL: Yes. I don't remember the exact dates. I would guess it was about a year
                    before I left there. There had been unhappiness for some time with the
                    government in power. Mrs. Bandaranaike had replaced her assassinated husband. I
                    think his party thought that they would use the name Bandaranaike and that she
                    would be a figurehead. Somewhat to their surprise, I think, she became a
                    powerful personality in her own right, and she was very much in charge. She had
                    a controversial nephew named Felix Bandaranaike, who was always kind of off
                    there on the side and so forth. There was a lot of dissatisfaction among the
                    capitalist minded, free trade, right wing, if you will, types in Ceylon. There
                    had been rumblings for some time. There is no doubt that the government in power
                    had a number of pretty far left types in it. They were doing all kinds of
                    things, many of which needed to be donin other words, spreading the benefits
                    that were available down to everybody on the island. They were on this Sinhalese
                    nationalist kick, which meant attempting to have everything in Sinhala, which is
                    understood by only a few million people in the world. Of course, educated
                    Ceylonese, which extended pretty far down in the population, whether they were
                    Tamil or Sinhalese, English was the common language. It was a shame, but it was
                    impossible to break away from that. That was causing problems. Then there had
                    been a lot of changes. They made a lot of changes in the upper structure of the
                    army, which was not very important at that time (This was before the real civil
                    war developed.) and the civil service and the businesspeople and so forth. So,
                    there were constantly rumors. Something had to be done about this. A bunch of
                    these people got together and plotted to overthrow the government. Then they
                    realized that their plot was being talked about around town, so they all met
                    down on a beach near Colombo one night and decided that they'd better call this
                    thing off. Exactly what their physical plans had been, I don't know or I've
                    forgotten. Anyhow, they all went home and, of course, the government then sent
                    policemen around and arrested them all. They were held in prison before trial
                    for a long, long time. Then finally a special panel was convened of judges to
                    try them. The trial was still going on at the time I left. They were convicted
                    and sentenced to prison, but some years later, after a change in government and
                    so forth, those that were in prison were amnestied. Nobody was hanged or
                    anything. There is no doubt about it that they were conspiring to overthrow the
                    government. There is no doubt about it that when it came down to it, the trial
                    was probably fair enough. However, a lot of people felt that, yes, they had been
                    bad and they had been punished and eventually they were amnestied.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the embassy involved or informed at any point?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>ODELL: That the coup was going to take place? I don't know. I was not sufficient
                    high ranking in the embassy at that time to know how much we knew about it. I
                    don't think there was any doubt in the coup planners' minds, however, that
                    strong elements in the American embassy didn't like the government in power.
                    Certainly, the Defense attach� made no bones about it, nor did the CIA people.
                    Whether they were actually involved in the planning, I doubt it. I don't think
                    they did. But at the Eighty Club, where a number of these coup plotters were
                    members, you would have to be kind of blind not to realize that there was a
                    considerable amount of grumbling going on, talk, this, that, and the other
                    thing, and rumors circulating that something might go on.</p>
                <p>Anyhow, the coup didn't succeed and the government was more firmly in power as a
                    result. It was still in power when I left. We had in the meantime suspended our
                    aid program and sent all the AID mission people home.</p>
                <p>Then I was transferred to Athens in 1964. I was assigned there to the Economic
                    Section. Athens was an interesting place, horribly overstaffed, in my opinion.
                    We had an enormous aid program and military program there. All kinds of camp
                    followers had drifted into this. Greece is a country of 10 million people or
                    less. We had an enormous infrastructure of all kinds there, a great big CIA
                    contingent. When I got there, we had a major general in charge of the JUSMAG
                    (Joint U.S. Military Advisory Group). His three section heads were full
                    colonels, one of them a Navy captain, in addition to which, we had our own
                    Defense attach� establishment with a Navy captain, an Air Force colonel, and an
                    Army colonel, all with their supporting staffs and everything. The CIA was just
                    kind of all over the place. The head of the CIA, Jack Moore, who is now dead,
                    when he died, the memorial service for him in the National Cathedral was just
                    absolutely packed. He was quite prominent and a very nice guy, a very
                    distinguished first family of Virginia gentleman. He carried this very, very
                    easily and graciously. He was a real nice guy. I liked Jack. He had an awful lot
                    of people working for him in Athens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was your ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ODELL: When I got there, it was a man who had been the director of AID. He Henry
                    Labouisse, he was from Connecticut. Norbert Anschutz was the DCM. Did you ever
                    know Norb?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I served for him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ODELL: He is still around. Labouisse was replaced by Phillips Talbot, who had
                    been the assistant secretary in NEA and come out of the Asia Foundation into the
                    Department. He was assistant secretary for NEA when I was in Ceylon. I met him
                    then. Then he came out and replaced Labouisse.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>I got to Athens in 1964, which was at the end of the really great time to be in
                    Greece if you were an official American. Things were still cheap. Greece had
                    been discovered by the tourists, but that was just really beginning to build up.
                    So, it was still possible to enjoy the many things that are possible to enjoy in
                    Greece. The dollar was still $35 to an ounce of gold. The drachma was cheap.
                    Things were available and servants were available. The countryside was not
                    cluttered up. Athens, which was beginning to get cluttered up, still wasn't. If
                    you got to downtown Athens early in the morning, you could actually see sheep
                    being driven through the streets. It was a great place to be from the personal
                    point of view.</p>
                <p>There were just people all over the embassy. We had officially discontinued our
                    economic aid mission. A great deal of my time was spent trying to tie up loose
                    ends left over from the AID mission project.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your title was what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ODELL: I was an economic officer. In the Economic Section, my boss, Bob McCoy,
                    had been director of the last AID mission in Ceylon. He had the title also of
                    economic counselor. They abolished the AID mission officially and he stayed on
                    as economic counselor. I was number two to him. Then we had a commercial attach�
                    who also reported to him over there. Then we had about four other officers in
                    the Economic Section and also local employees. McCoy was a very sharp man. He
                    had worked directly for Labouisse in AID. He was one of Labouisse's boys. After
                    Labouisse left, Bob didn't rank quite so high. Of course, his perks had been
                    taken away from him after he lost the AID mission. He no longer had a car and
                    driver. He no longer had all these things. He wasn't terribly happy. He was a
                    very active guy. So, he got an offer from Esso to go to work for them and he
                    left the government to work for them as head of the Government Relations
                    Department or something like that.</p>
                <p>He was replaced by Frank Butler. He had come in originally under the Manpower Act
                    proceedings. He was my boss until I left. He was a totally different guy than
                    Bob McCoy. McCoy was very active.</p>
                <p>I enjoyed Athens, except I got a little frustrated towards the end. There wasn't
                    a great deal of activity. But we personally found it very pleasant there.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>Of course, I was there when the Colonels' coup took place. That was another
                    thing. That was, again, in terms of U.S. government policy... I don't know if
                    you're familiar with the history of that. The Greek government in World War II
                    had gone into exile in Cairo. It was headed by Prime Minister George Papandreou.
                    When the war ended, he came back and was reinstalled by the British as prime
                    minister. Of course, the civil war in Greece broke out after World War II ended.
                    They had a civil war for almost four years in Greece. Consequently, Greece got a
                    very late start into the post World War II recovery. We had this big military
                    support operation there. But then various changes... Papandreou went out of
                    power and a man named Karamanlis was in power. He had a big famous falling out
                    with Queen Frederica. He went into exile in Paris, where he lived. He was sort
                    of like the Bonny Prince Charlie of Greece. He was off there. Everybody talked
                    about how wonderful it was when Karamanlis was in power. George Papandreou had a
                    son, Andreas Papandreou, who had gone to the United States as a young lad and
                    become an American citizen. He was briefly in the United States Navy and had
                    studied economics. I think he taught in Minnesota, where he acquired his wife,
                    Margaret, who had previously been married to somebody else. I think it was a bit
                    of a scandal in the University of Minnesota faculty over that one. But Andreas
                    went to California and became a full professor in the Economics Department at
                    Berkeley. Apparently, his resume listed him as having been chairman of the
                    department, which he was, except I found out that that is not quite what it
                    means. California had a practice, I believe, of rotating the deanship or
                    chairmanship of the department among the senior professors. In other words, if
                    there were four, one would have it for a year or two years and then they would
                    rotate. But he had an international reputation as an economist. He decided to go
                    back to Greece, first to head a special economic study foundation project that
                    had been establisheI think with some American money in iand then he went into
                    politics and became very controversial in that capacity. Many of our people just
                    couldn't stand him.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>When I got there, he was not in office, but then he became the minister of
                    coordination, which meant that he was the one who dealt with foreign governments
                    in terms of any aid programs in Greece, which meant us. I met him several times.
                    He was in my home. He was quite senior, of course, but he and his wife did come
                    to my home. And we were in their home. He was a good looking guy. Women thought
                    he looked very, very attractive, which he was. He spoke English beautifully. He
                    was a little bit erratic. Greek politics were very convoluted and tangled and
                    very difficult to put your finger on. But what happened was that there was a
                    series of caretaker governments and then under their constitution, general
                    elections were programmed for May of 1967. It was I thoughand most observers
                    objectively thoughthat probably the party to which Andreas and his father
                    belonged would come back into power and that Andreas might very well become the
                    prime minister. His father was getting pretty old at that time. It was at that
                    point in April 1967 that this coup took place. Again, I don't think there was
                    any doubt that the coup plotters thought that this would be something that we
                    would be terribly upset about, but I don't believe we were involved. The day of
                    the coup, I saw Jack Morrie at the embassy and I never saw such a shaken man in
                    my life. He didn't really know that this was going to take place. Of course, if
                    the CIA in a given country has any great value, this is the sort of thing they
                    ought to be on, but they didn't. The people who pulled the coup, three colonels
                    and a brigadier general, were pretty well unknown. It was a magnificently
                    handled affair. What they took was the big NATO plan, that if the balloon went
                    up and the Communist Bloc attacked NATO, Greece was a member of NATO, as was
                    Turkey, and the plans had been laid and it was assumed that the attack would
                    come down through Bulgaria and so forth. The contingency plan of what would
                    happen in Greece if that happened provided for certain people on a given lisa
                    few thousand peoplto be arrested and interned. Certain strategic points would be
                    occupied immediately. Marshall law would be declared, etc. They simply took this
                    plan, which was already thoroughly worked out, and applied it with a few
                    twistlike arresting the leaders of the government and so forth. I think only one
                    person was killed during the coup and that was a woman that was hit by a stray
                    warning shot that had been fired.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>I had been in the United States. My mother died and I went home for her funeral.
                    I had only been back a couple of days. It was morning. I was getting ready to go
                    to the embassy. My wife came in and said, “Malcolm Thompson is at the door.” He
                    was a Foreign Service officer in the Political Section. He lived not far from
                    me. That was very unusual for him to come to the door at that hour of the
                    morning. I went and Mac said, “Harry, something has happened. The phones aren't
                    working and there are soldiers all over the place.” So, I turned on the radio
                    and all you could hear was marshall music being played. So, Mac and I decided
                    that we would go to the assistant military attach�'s house, who was also there,
                    and see whether he knew anything. He didn't know any more than we did. We
                    decided we would get in his car and see if we could go down to the embassy. We
                    started encountering roadblocks and were turned away. But we finally worked our
                    way around through back streets and go to the embassy. There was Jack Morrie,
                    the CIA station chief, in his World War II Marine colonel uniform. He figured
                    that it would be easier to get through in a uniform, which was true. The problem
                    with Jack was that the uniform no longer fitted him very well. He was semi
                    ridiculous in appearance. Anyhow, everything had stopped. The airports were
                    closed, as was everything else. The first two or three days, we were kept off
                    the street. Then things sort of started moving. Our policy was totally without
                    any direction at that point. We had no guidance from Washington except to keep
                    our distance from these people. Well, this isn't practical in some respects. I
                    mean, what do you do?</p>
                <p>Things went bumping along. I wasn't privy to what was going on up at the top, but
                    I did know that there was a lot of heat generated because among the guys that
                    had been arrested was Papandreou. He was their prize capture. He had a lot of
                    contacts in the United States. Lyndon Johnson subsequently said that “I'm never
                    so tired of hearing anything as hearing about that damned economics teacher they
                    got over there in Greece.” The academic world from Galbraith and everybody all
                    kind of rallied and started to put the heat on.</p>
                <p>Eventually, they did let him go. He left the country and went to live in Sweden
                    for a while. He subsequently, of course, became prime minister of Greece. His
                    son is now the foreign minister of Greece, George (named for his
                    grandfather).</p>
                <p>Our life went on, but the problem was what do you do? Do you continue dealing
                    with the civil servants and stuff that you had been dealing with? We did have
                    programs. We had a big ongoing PL 480 supported food program. We had set up a
                    school lunch program that reached virtually every schoolchild in Greece. It was
                    a very good, valuable program. At that time, an awful lot of people in rural
                    sections of Greece were very, very poor. The kids simply didn't have the meals.
                    What do you do? Do you continue these programs? So, we kind of bumped along.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Of course, in June of 1967, the Arab Israeli War erupted. The Department in its
                    wisdom decided that the Americans evacuated from the Middle East should go to
                    Greece. You can't have umpteen thousand or whatever it was Americans coming into
                    Greece without some contact with the local government. I don't remember the
                    argument being made that they shouldn't come to Greece, that they should go to
                    Germany, where there were all kinds of Army hotels and facilities. So, we in the
                    Economic Section were instructed to go down and talk to the civil aviation
                    authorities and we were to talk to the central bank and we were to do this and
                    do that. The upshot of it was that contacts started being resumed. I don't think
                    there was ever any official decision, but we just started doing it.</p>
                <p>To talk about my personal role in this, I still retained a pretty good working
                    knowledge of German at that time. It turned out that one of these colonels,
                    Makarezos, had been their military attach� in Bonn and spoke pretty good German.
                    He had become the minister of coordination. So, when Ambassador Talbot went down
                    to see him specifically because they had discontinued the school lunch feeding
                    program, and argued that this program, which was certainly non political from
                    our point of view, was a good thing, they had decided that anything that
                    foreigners were doing was to be stopped. So, we went down and we were kicking
                    this around for a while with an interpreter. Then I asked Makarezos directly if
                    he spoke German. He said he did. So, we were able to communicate directly.
                    Talbot promptly said, “Well, would you mind if Mr. Odell came back and saw you
                    about the details of this?” So, from that point of view, my background in
                    Germany was again useful in Greece. We never became buddies, but we were able to
                    talk directly without an intermediary and that made things a lot simpler. I
                    suggested to him simply that he go out himself into the country. Like so many of
                    the Greek officers at that time, they had come from rural backgrounds. We said,
                    “Just go out into your hometown and see this program” and he did. He agreed that
                    we should continue it.</p>
                <p>Otherwise, things settled down. Gradually, as revolutions do, the classic
                    pathology, they started quarreling among themselves. The one colonel,
                    Papadopoulos, had become the leader. He began really insisting on the perks of
                    office. There was internal tension. But they were still in power when I left for
                    Amman. Subsequently (I don't remember the exact dates of this.), they trouble
                    started with the students at Athens University. Somebody got pretty heavy-handed
                    and sent the troops into the university and the troops refused to fire on the
                    students. It is a conscript army in Greece and most of these (It was then a very
                    small country.) were from closely knit families. The vast majority of these
                    soldiers were very young conscripts and were not about to start shooting
                    students and so forth. I think that was the thing that pushed it over the edge.
                    Karamanlis, I think, came back from Paris. Last I heard from Bob Keeley, who was
                    there at the time as a junior political officer (He and I knew each other quite
                    well then. Henry Tasca became the ambassador. He was quite friendly with the
                    colonels. I never knew him.) that one of the triumvirate, I believe, has died.
                    The others are still in prison, although it is quite a commodious prison life.
                    No government has yet decided to amnesty them.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you characterize the colonels' coup and our
                        attitude towards it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ODELL: I would say that we kind of drifted into more conventional relations with
                    them. As they stayed in power, at least for a period, I think some of the more
                    egregious aspects of it began to kind of drift away. Parliament was not in
                    session, but troops were progressively withdrawn from things. The banks got
                    opened and civil aviation began functioning. Things were getting along. My
                    impression (I saw him, but never met him.) was that the brigadier general,
                    Stephanopoulos, was just a pure, blunt soldier type. Makarezos, a lieutenant
                    colonel who had been military attach� in Bonn, I think was a more subtle
                    character and was probably more intelligent. I thought he was personally an
                    honest man. The other one, Papadopoulos, who was the leader, was shifty eyed and
                    he relished the perks of power. He was eventually in a palace coup of his
                    own.</p>
                <p>The young king's role in this was that he attempted a very feeble countercoup and
                    then had to leave the country. Subsequently, many years later, there was a
                    referendum in Greece and he was invited not to come back. He was a bit of a
                    tragic figure. They used him. He was king and he stayed king until he attempted
                    this countercoup, which had no chance whatsoever of succeeding.</p>
                <p>He went off to Rome. The Greeks, I don't think they missed their monarchy very
                    much. It was not of Greek origin originally.</p>
                <p>Tape 2, Side A</p>
                <p>The king was a squash player. Malcolm Thompson and I used to (There were squash
                    courts at the Athens Tennis Club.) play squash. One day, we were told that we
                    were going to have to vacate our court because His Majesty wanted to play. We
                    said, “Well, yes, of course. We'd be glad to give way to His Majesty.” Who
                    should His Majesty show up with, but with his brother in law Juan Carlos of
                    Spain. He had married Constantine's sister. She was a Greek princess. That
                    caused a bit of a controversy because they were Greek Orthodox, of course, and
                    Juan Carlos was Catholic. The two royals came down the corridor and we
                    discreetly gave way to them.</p>
                <p>He was a very attractive young man with a pretty Danish wife, of course, and so
                    on. He didn't have a political stature. The general feeling was that he did what
                    his mother told him to do. She was not terribly well liked. She was modern day
                    German. She had been the German princess. Most everybody of any significance
                    lived not far from anybody else in Athens. There were certain sections where you
                    were supposed to live and you did.</p>
                <p>That's about it for Greece.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>I was supposed to go back to the Department. I got word (I had never heard his
                    name before.) that Ambassador Harrison Symmes from Jordan was in town and that I
                    was being considered to be the economic counselor in Amman and he'd like to talk
                    to me. I said this was new to me. I thought I was going back to the Department.
                    I went and talked to Symmes. Actually, I was kind of intrigued with the idea of
                    going. He dropped hints that, if things work out, I might become the DCM. He
                    didn't say so, but that was kind of the implication. So, we went to Jordan. In
                    due course, that did happen. Did you ever know Duncan? He was the DCM. When he
                    left, I became the DCM.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Situate us in Jordanian history.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ODELL: This was 1968. They had gotten into the '67 War. Apparently, they would
                    have had been better off not fighting at all. The Israelis have always said they
                    offered not to fight them if they didn't fight. Whether the Israelis would have
                    occupied the West Bank and Jerusalem is another question. I don't know. But
                    certainly the Jordanians, I believe... Hussein flew to Cairo and embraced Nasser
                    and all that sort of stuff. Then the war promptly started. It was just a debacle
                    as far as the Jordanians were concerned. The Israelis just ran right over them.
                    There was some rather nasty fighting in Jerusalem itself. Fighting in cities is
                    not an easy thing to do anyhow. I think the Jordanian army, what fighting it put
                    up was in Jerusalem. There was some serious fighting there and a number of
                    people on both sides were killed. The Israelis, of course, were determined to
                    capture the old city and they did. That was in June of 1967.</p>
                <p>I got to Jordan in September of 1968, a year later. Of course, to me, not having
                    been assigned in Jordan before, the differences weren't immediately noticeable.
                    But to people who had been there before the '67 War, it was an enormous
                    difference. Apparently, life in Jordan for American diplomats before the '67 War
                    had been extremely pleasant. You could go to Jerusalem if you wanted to. It is a
                    fascinating place to be. We would go down to Jericho. If you had the money and
                    the means, you went to Jericho in the chilly weather. The king had a winter
                    palace down there. Life was quite agreeable and then this trauma hit them. They
                    lost the West Bank. Transjordan (or Jordan proper), was largely desert. The West
                    Bank was settled and civilized and they lost all that. So, it was quite
                    traumatic. Of course, the refugee population had been increased enormously
                    suddenly. The strain on the facilities in Jordan was very, very great.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>When I got there as economic counselor, we had an AID mission, of course. It was
                    smaller than the one we had had in Ceylon, but again, I don't think there was a
                    great deal of clear focus on what the purpose of the exercise was, what they
                    were doing. There were some good people doing some good things, but I couldn't
                    sense any coherent picture or package. Although Harrison Symmes was nothing at
                    all like Ambassador Willis in Ceylon, he shared her view that he should have as
                    little as possible to do with the AID mission and that his economic counselor
                    officer should be the one that dealt with the AID mission. So, I myself was not
                    terribly interested in that. I tended, I must confess, to push a lot of that off
                    a guy named Arthur (Art) Bowman, who was my number two in the Economic Section.
                    Poor Art, I'm afraid, was the guy that I would say, “Art, you go to that AID
                    staff meeting” and so forth. Of course, I had in mind quite clearly that I hoped
                    I would become the DCM, which I did become.</p>
                <p>Harrison Symmes was very attractive, a very nice guy. He had a very pretty wife,
                    Joan. He was very much of an Arabist, but an unusual Arabist in that by that
                    time he was beginning to get a reputation among other Arabists of drifting from
                    the faith a little bit. He was not all that keen on Arabic rhetoric. It can get
                    pretty intense and pretty hard to take. Of course, we were blamed for their
                    debacle. If we did not support the Israelis, this would not have happened to
                    Jordan. It was our fault and we ought to do something about it. Well, you can
                    say, well, there is fundamentally a certain measure of truth to that, that if we
                    didn't support the Israelis, they wouldn't be as successful as they were. There
                    is no doubt about that. If we didn't give them or sell them these Phantom
                    airplanes, they wouldn't be so dominant in the skies over Jordan. Having said
                    all that, on a day to day basis of not being able to do anything without being
                    lectured on that subject, it got to be a little bit weary. It got to Symmes. He
                    also had (still has) a bit of a temper. If he is pushed very hard, he can kind
                    of explode. He can get pretty uptight every now and then about things like this.
                    This was a period of growing tension. The Fedayeen movement, the Arafat
                    movement, when I first got there, as economic counselor, we lived in an
                    apartment not terribly far with the embassy. Amman was built on hills. They say
                    “the seven hills of Amman,” called “jebels,” of course. The embassy in those
                    days, the chancery was on Jebel Luwebdeh and we lived near it. The center of
                    gravity of the city had moved by this time over to Jebel Amman. There were deep
                    wadis in between. It was an interesting place. Man's history in Amman goes way,
                    way back. It was Philadelphia under the Romans and the Greeks and there are
                    Roman artifacts all over the place. It goes back to the Stone Age. People have
                    lived there for a long, long time. It is a very interesting place. I lived not
                    far from the chancery.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>The Fedayeen, Arafat and company, Time Magazine ran a cover article on him way,
                    way back. Barbara, my wife, said to me, “I've seen that man.” Their headquarters
                    was just down the street. But all the while we were there, this Fedayeen
                    presence and power was growing. Periodically, something would flare up and there
                    would be trouble. It was usually in the refugee camps and stuff. The presence of
                    these paramilitary groups became more and more obvious. It became more and more
                    obvious that there were many areas of Amman and in the countryside where the
                    legitimate government really had no effective control. It was a growing problem.
                    It began to impact on us because it seemed that hardly a week would go by that
                    it would not be dangerous to go here or there. The Fedayeen down in the valley
                    periodically went right across the border into Israel to do something and the
                    Israelis would come over and retaliate. Then, of course, the tension would
                    increase some more.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>In the meantime, of course, the so called “war of attrition” was building up
                    between the Egyptians and the Israelis along their border. It was a difficult
                    period and it was unfortunate, too. Amman must have one of the nicest climates
                    in the world. You're up just high enough. You get some nasty weather during the
                    winter. You get heavy rains. There is very little snow, but it can get to be
                    unpleasant. But most of the time, in the summer, you're up high enough that the
                    heat doesn't really get to you. In six or seven months of the year, it just kind
                    of a lovely golden glow. The Jordanian people that we encountered were quite
                    agreeable. Jordan has always been a step removed from most of the Arab countries
                    in terms of western orientation. Of course, the King was very much so. We
                    enjoyed many aspects of it, but there was always this background of trouble
                    brewing. It just kept building up and building up, and then periodic this, that,
                    and the other thing. Of course, it politically came to a crunch with us when Joe
                    Sisco, who was then the assistant secretary for NEA, came out to visit the area.
                    The Fedayeen, groups of them, in Amman decided to protest. They had big
                    demonstrations and they burned down our cultural center and trashed things
                    around the chancery and so forth. The police, whether they were unable to or
                    afraid to, really did nothing to stop this. Much of the crowds were young
                    people, students and so forth, egged on by people. You could see the Fedayeen
                    encouraging them to do these things. They burned down our cultural center, which
                    the USIA guy, David Strapland, was very proud of. David was really shook. They
                    came in with burning devices, highly sophisticated ones. It take a lot to burn
                    books. Books don't burn very easily and they burned these books and trashed the
                    place. Symmes was annoyed. When the foreign minister called up, I was on the
                    extension listening in. He said how sorry he was for all this. Symmes really let
                    him have it, that that is not good enough, that the authorities didn't stop this
                    and this was not our fault, etc. He really let him have it. Sisco by this time
                    was in Tel Aviv. We had made rather elaborate arrangementI had been involved
                    with them in the middle of the nighthat Sisco was going to come over, but we
                    would arrange with the Jordanians that they would send a helicopter down to the
                    valley. Sisco would come down to what used to be called the Allenby Bridge and
                    was officially now Hussein Bridge. It was nothing but a bailey bridge across a
                    creek. Then he would be picked up and brought to Amman. The helicopter was the
                    idea that it wasn't safe to travel by road down there because of the Fedayeen.
                    That was the first consideration: would it be safe for him to come? We had had
                    all these riots. This was kicked around for a while and then they burned the
                    cultural center and everything else and Symmes had this discussion with the
                    foreign minister. At the end of it, Symmes recommended to Sisco that he not
                    come. He put it up to the foreign minister that “I don't see how you can
                    guarantee the safety of this American official.” The foreign minister kept
                    saying, “Oh, he will be safe.” I'm quite sure he would have, but Sisco ended up
                    saying, “Alright, I won't come.” Well, I think it was that night that Symmes
                    called me at home and said he wanted to see me. So, I went over. He had just
                    gotten word that the Jordanians had gone into the Department of State in
                    Washington and asked that Mr. Symmes be transferred. I said, “Well, what are you
                    going to do about it?” He said, “Well, I don't know what the Department is going
                    to do about it.” I said, “Well, they haven't declared you persona non grata?” He
                    said, “No, and I made that point to the Department, but I think they'll probably
                    go along with this.”</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>So, they did. I always thought at the time that the Department again was a little
                    wishy washy in this. They might have said to the Jordanians, “Well, it you don't
                    like Mr. Symmes, say so.” But they didn't. They said, “Wouldn't it be nice if
                    you transferred him” rather than simply saying, “We're kicking him out.”</p>
                <p>I think they thought he would leave immediately. But he didn't. The first thing
                    he said was that (This was in the June of 1970 or thereabouts.) their son was in
                    school in the international school in Amman and they wanted him to finish the
                    semester. If Symmes himself left, he didn't see any reason why his wife should
                    have to leave. So, Symmes stayed on for quite a while. I forget just how long it
                    was until the foreign minister said to me one day, “When is he going to leave?”
                    I said, “I don't know. He is taking his time.” He said, “Why doesn't he leave?”
                    I said, “He hasn't got his transfer orders.” So, Symmes was very methodically
                    packing up his books personally. Eventually, he did leave and I became the
                    charg�. But his wife, Joan, stayed on until the kid finished school. She stayed
                    on in the residence. She kept a very low profile. She stayed there and we gave
                    her full suppora car and driver and everything elsbut she stayed pretty much in
                    the home. She did come over to our house a couple of times for dinner, but she
                    didn't entertain except American gals. She would play bridge or something during
                    that period. Symmes ended up becoming Tom Macalmee's deputy in Congressional
                    Relations.</p>
                <p>But I was the charg� and I stayed charg� until September. Then I was replaced.
                    Then Dean Brown was named ambassador. He came. I left. Just about the day after
                    I left was when the September shootout started, which was unfortunate
                    professionally for me, in a way. It would have been better if I had been able to
                    stay, but I didn't know what was going to happen. Tensions were building up and
                    we evacuated dependents and so forth. Never again. That is a real mess. It just
                    upsets everybody's lives. You can't imagine the number of people, the school
                    problems, the family problems, and everything else. That happened. After Symmes
                    left, that summer was a long, hot summer in Amman. There was constant trouble
                    building up between the government and the Fedayeen. It was obvious that
                    something was going to give.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>The climax came when they hijacked the three airplanes. TWA, a British plane, and
                    a Swiss plane. I think one of them went to Cairo, but the others landed on a
                    World War II airstrip outside Amman. I think that was the crunch point. By this
                    time, my successor, a kind of a political appointee, came in. I was anxious to
                    leave at that point. I knew I was going and I wanted to get the hell out of
                    there. My daughter was in college and my son had to get set in school. I was
                    supposed to be on a promotion panel back in Washington. Time was going on and
                    everything else. So, this guy came in. Dean Brown was up in Beirut. I left and
                    then Dean came down and things started practically the next day. But what
                    happened before the planes were hijacked that summer, our assistant military
                    attach� was killed in a shootout. His house was in an area that was being
                    contended over by factions within the Fedayeen. They came to the door to his
                    house. I think he made a mistake probably. He was an Arab language officer in
                    the military. He spoke just enough Arabic for them to fire through the door. I
                    think if he had spoken English and stuff, they might not have done that. But he
                    was killed. Then they started stealing our automobiles and everything. Things
                    were getting very, very bad that summer. We evacuated the dependents and so
                    forth. Finally, the king screwed his courage to the sticking point and told the
                    army to go after the Fedayeen and their September civil war sort of broke out.
                    It ended with the Fedayeen being driven out of Jordan at that point. Some of
                    them crossed into Israel and begged for asylum. Once Hussein's royal troops
                    (bedouin troops mostly) got going, they didn't need much encouragement to shoot
                    Palestinians. They were quite happy to shoot Palestinians.</p>
                <p>Getting back to me, I came back to the Department. By this time, my promotion
                    panel job had been given to somebody else because the promotion panel already
                    started. I wandered around for two or three weeks until I got the job in North
                    African Affairs. I stayed there until 1973, I guess.</p>
                <p>I then was assigned over to the Foreign Service Institute helping run a seminar
                    over there until the Swiss job came up. Then I went to Switzerland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's not skip by North Africa quite so quickly. You must
                        have had some interesting issues there while you were there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ODELL: Yes, we did. The non commissioned officers tried to kill the king in
                    Morocco. Stuart Rockwell was at that party. I remember his telegram: “I have
                    just returned from several hours of horror.” I guess it was very unpleasant.
                    When we were in Switzerland, the French ambassador, LeBelle, had been the French
                    ambassador in Morocco and had known Rockwell and been with him on that occasion.
                    He and Rockwell had, among other things, loaded the body of their Belgian
                    colleague into an automobile or something. LeBelle told me a lot that I hadn't
                    known before about that event. We had that one. They tried two or three times to
                    kill the king. These guys tried to kill him. I think the air force tried to kill
                    him. They executed a bunch of people after that.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>We had Bourguiba of Tunisia. He was just a grand old man. David Newsom was very
                    skeptical of the value of Bourguiba, who was the great moderate in the Arab
                    Israeli thing. What is moderation consisted of saying was, “Why don't those
                    people live peacefully together? They ought to have a nice, peaceful state there
                    with the Arabs and the Israelis settling down and living happily together.” That
                    is about what it amounted to. Newsom said, “He's been dining out on that line
                    and isn't going to happen. It doesn't amount to anything.”</p>
                <p>Libya was very much on the list at the time of the oil interests. We had at that
                    time over 4,000 Americans living and working in Libya. We had incidents. I
                    remember the Libyans arrested a couple of young American evangelists for public
                    proselytizing, which was against the law. This caused a great flap among the
                    American evangelical community in the United States. They said we ought to do
                    something about this. Libyan oil. Morocco because of the communications station
                    there. Tunisia.</p>
                <p>The Sudan was part of our territory at the time. That was an interesting part of
                    my job. The Sudanese were making noises that they would be willing to resume
                    full diplomatic relations with us, which they had broken at the time of the '67
                    Arab Israeli War. Rogers, who was the Secretary at the time, was very anxious to
                    have this promoted. So, Kurt Moore was our charg� in Khartoum. He was head of
                    our interests section at the Dutch embassy, actually. I was sent out to see what
                    was going on. Kurt arranged for me to go down to the southern part of the Sudan
                    where the civil war, which is still going on, had been going on and had kind of
                    come to a pause at that time. One of the ideas was that one of the conditions
                    under which we would be willing to resume relations if they wanted to (and what
                    they really wanted was for us to resume an aid program, of course), was that
                    this trouble in the south be settled peacefully. So, I went out to Khartoum.
                    Kurt had arranged for me to go down to the south. He wanted somebody from the
                    embassy to go along with us. So, by coincidence, a fellow named Sanderson, who
                    had been our administrative officer in Colombo, Ceylon, while I was there, was
                    the administrative officer in Khartoum. I knew Sandy. He was an old military
                    type, a very common sense, practical sort of guy. So, I suggested that he be the
                    fellow to go along. We went down and spent a couple of weeks down there. We
                    traveled by jeep down to the Ugandan border. That was a route through which
                    supplies might conceivably be brought in to aid people who had been dislocated
                    by the civil war. We came back and made a number of recommendations, none of
                    which were adopted. One of the things we said was that the best thing, if we
                    resumed aid, we could do was build a bridge across the Nile at a place called
                    Juba, where there was a rickety old ferry. What the CIA could do if you asked
                    them to do it... I got back and we got in touch with the CIA. I said to them,
                    “Would it be feasible to build a bridge there?” My god, their research staff
                    came up with the depth of the Nile, the nature of the bottom on the Nile, the
                    speed of the current at that point. We gave all this to the Army, whose Corps of
                    Engineers looked at it and, given all these facts and figures, said, “Yes, we
                    could put a bridge across there.” So, we recommended this. Of course, they
                    didn't do it, but the Dutch did. Kurt told the Dutch about this and they came up
                    and put up a bailey bridge. The Dutch are good at building bridges. They build a
                    lot of bridges. So, that was an interesting thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>The next thing was, we sent an AID mission group out to Khartoum. I went along
                    sort of as the political commissar. I met with Kurt and with the Sudanese
                    officials and talked and talked and talked. It ended up with AID recommending
                    that our aid, when we resumed it, be in the form of working together with the
                    World Bank to irrigate a section of the country for cotton growing or something
                    like that. Building the bridge was not something they wanted to do.</p>
                <p>Libyan oil was very much the thing. It is what is known in the trade as “sweet”
                    oil. It has a low sulfur content and is very prized for that. It is very
                    important to the Italians, who, of course, had been in Libya. Occidental
                    Petroleum went there and then we had Armand Hammer who was very active in Libya.
                    The oil companies were not at all interested in fighting Qadhafi about things.
                    Of course, in those days, Qadhafi was constantly doing things that upset people
                    in Washington and so forth. Libya had not broken diplomatic relations with us
                    during the Six Day War. They were about the only Arab country that had not done
                    so. So, we still had an ambassador and so forth in Libya. Of course, we don't
                    now.</p>
                <p>Mauritania. Periodically, there were problems there. They wanted to make David
                    Korn ambassador to Mauritania. He was turned down, probably because he was
                    Jewish, although I don't know anybody who has said that.</p>
                <p>I had a very active boss, Jim Blake. David Newsom had been ambassador in Tripoli
                    and was very much interested. So, I wouldn't say substantively I threw much
                    weight around in North African Affairs. It was interesting enough, but I always
                    felt that that job shouldn't have existed really. Those deputy jobs in those
                    positions, come on. They had several very good, active country desk officers in
                    North African Affairs, people like Bob Pelletreau, who subsequently became
                    assistant secretary. There was also the man who became ambassador in Cairo. His
                    father was CIA. (Tape turned off)</p>
                <p>We had all these bright guys, such as Frank Wisner. Here I got a very active
                    assistant secretary of State, a very active, bright office director who had been
                    Newsom's DCM in Tripoli, so they worked very closely together, and all these hot
                    potato desk officers. What is a deputy supposed to do except kind of drift
                    around in between being beaten from the top and a pain in the ass to the guys
                    down below? It's a lousy job. I recommended (Of course, they didn't do it.) in
                    writing after I left there that the senior desk officer be designated as the
                    person to be the acting director of the office if the director was on vacation
                    or traveling or something like that, but they not have a formal deputy. Jim
                    Blakand I would have done the same thing if I had been Jiwanted to know what the
                    hell was going on. So, he would talk directly to Frank (Wisner) or to Bob
                    Pelletreau, who had been in Amman with me, incidentally. The Foreign Service is
                    kind of incestuous sometimes. It was a good thing, too. Jim, if there was
                    anything particularly going on, he wanted to know and he didn't want to delaand
                    why should hto work his way up through. So, I would be reduced to standing off
                    on the side and so forth.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved at all in the Moroccan decision to
                        recall Stuart Rockwell?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ODELL: I knew what happened at the time. Interestingly enough, a few years ago at
                    a Christmas party, I ran into Dick Parker. I hadn't talked to him for a long
                    time. We were reminiscing. He said he never quite knew what had gone on with his
                    boss, Rockwell. The king asked specifically if Robert Murphy could come out.
                    Murphy at the time was chairman or CEO of Corning Glass Company. So, we arranged
                    (not secretly, but quietly) for Murphy to go out. Murphy said he would be glad
                    to go out. He knew the king. He went to Paris. I remember, Jack Kubisch, the DCM
                    in Paris at that time had been very involved in our AID program in Ceylon. I
                    remember getting on the phone to him and saying, “Jack, you're going to have a
                    visitor. Just take care of him. He's unofficial, but take care of him and don't
                    question him too much” or something like that. So, they took care of him. I
                    forget what Murphy had to do in Paris, but he went to Paris and then he went
                    out. When he came back, he invited Jim Blake to join him for lunch at the
                    Metropolitan Club for a debriefing. Jim came back and I got this from Jim. In
                    essence, what the king had said was that he didn't want a lot of trouble, but he
                    didn't want Mr. Rockwell around the place. What was the matter with Mr.
                    Rockwell? “Well, he intimidates me,” said the king. Rockwell had a hawklike
                    bearing and manner. “He intimidates me.” I don't know whether he laughed at that
                    point or not, but that was what Murphy said the King had said. So, arrangements
                    were made for Rockwell to be removed. I don't know who replaced him.</p>

                <p>(Tape turned off)</p>
                <p>ODELL: Dick Parker was in Cairo when the June '67 War broke out. Of course, the
                    first day was all confusion. These planes were coming out of Cairo, Jordan, and
                    every place saying that the Israelis were going to be finally obliterated and
                    driven into the sea and stuff. It wasn't until maybe the next day or so that it
                    became evident that that wasn't happening. In fact, the contrary was beginning
                    to happen. Cairo came in with this telegram starting off, “At the close of a
                    busy day, we have this to report.” This was Dick Parker drafting this. He went
                    on to say what a confused situation it was. He said that the Egyptians claimed
                    that they had shot down 165 Israeli airplanes or whatever it was they were
                    claiming. “We suggest that the Department apply a mandasti quotient of 10 to one
                    on these planes.” I thought to myself, “Who is doing this and getting away with
                    it?” It was Parker. He had the gift of... He and I formed a little club at one
                    time, called SOFA (Safe Our Forest Association). I was struck by the fact that
                    he would plead for, if somebody was too prolific in their writing, he would say,
                    “Save our forest. You're cutting down trees to make this paper.” So, I suggested
                    to him one time that we form an SOFA and for years whenever we saw a document
                    that struck us as being considerably longer than need be, we called each other's
                    attention.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You moved on then to FSI.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ODELL: Yes. That was a pleasant and not very productive period. I was helping run
                    the Seminar over there, which had evolved... They had something originally
                    funded called “counterinsurgency” or something like that. This had evolved over
                    the years under a guy named Albert Humood. It was called the Executive Seminar.
                    Actually, as it evolved under him, it had become a fairly useful thing. For
                    three week periods, they had a group that was primarily military people who were
                    going to go out and be military attach�s. They came over and then there were
                    supposed to be people from the Department. It was always difficult to get people
                    from the Department assigned for such a short period of time. Inevitably, if it
                    was a desk officer who was any good, somebody would want him back. It was always
                    a problem getting Department representation. We had military and the CIA would
                    always send some people. Then there were people from the Department of
                    Agriculture. It was primarily for people who were from other agencies who were
                    going to be assigned abroad as attach�s. The leavening of this was supposed to
                    be Foreign Service officers from the Department of State. That was the problem,
                    of getting these people to participate in these groups. But we would line up
                    about 20 speakers. It was an instructive thing, how readily the main peoplif you
                    said you were calling from the Department of State, they would be interested. We
                    got some academics and had some standard ones. There was some guy from
                    Princeton, Mari Leady, a sociology, who was standard. I got A.J. (Al) Meyer from
                    Harvard. He was very much the Middle East guru up at Harvard. I had gotten to
                    know him the year the Department had sent me to Harvard. He subsequently became
                    a very, very high paid consultant to the oil companies. I ran into him in London
                    being chauffeured around in a fancy car once. There were people like that and
                    Max Burne(end of tape)</p>
                <p>Tape 2, Side B</p>
                <p>this thing had evolved. It was not a bad thing at all. The Department in its way
                    was missing an opportunity to put some of its impression on these people from
                    other agencies and so forth. It was a struggle to get the Department to assign
                    people there as participants in this seminar for a three week period. I don't
                    think it was ever suggested that he come, but we'll say, somebody of the caliber
                    of Frank Wisner to come over and just be one of the students in the group, you
                    know, with these guys. The Department made a mistake by not seeing the way to
                    clear to that. Anyhow, I did that from 1973 1975. After I left, the thing was
                    abolished.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>I had at that point been negotiating to become consul general in Dusseldorf.
                    Martin Hillenbrand was the ambassador to Germany. He had been in Berlin while I
                    was there. I think that could probably have happened eventually, but out of the
                    clear blue sky, I got called by Joan Clark. Joan and I had had our difficulties
                    in the past, but she called me and said that a job had come open and would I be
                    interested in going to Switzerland as DCM? I said, “Well, what about Dusseldorf,
                    Joan?” She said, “I don't know what's going to happen to Dusseldorf.” So, I
                    thought over this and said, “Well, maybe I'd better take this one. I did.
                    Whether that was wise or not, probably not. I'd probably have been better off as
                    consul general in Dusseldorf, but who could tell?</p>
                <p>I went to Switzerland and I was DCM to three ambassadors. The first one was
                    Dominic, who was actually from Colorado. He replaced Gary Hart, who wanted to be
                    President, and got in trouble with bureaus. Peter Dominic was a senator from
                    Colorado. The Dominics are a banking family from New York. They were around a
                    long time. Peter had moved as a young man to Colorado to dig his own fortune,
                    which I think he had made, and then became a senator. I don't know how he came
                    to be ambassador. Anyway, he was there very, very briefly and then I was charg�
                    for quite an extended period of time until Matt Davis came. Then he left and
                    then Marvin Warner came in. Marvin subsequently went to prison in Ohio, not for
                    anything he had done as ambassador in Bern, but for violating banking rules and
                    regulations in the state of Ohio. The federal government tried to nail him, but
                    he slipped out of that one. The state of Ohio got him. He actually went to
                    prison. That was an interesting experience. I was struck... Matt Davis was
                    totally CIA gunshy. He wouldn't even have the CIA station chief and his wife to
                    dinner in the residence. He included them in the Fourth of July reception, but
                    that was about it. He was so afraid that anybody would think he had a CIA
                    connection. But Dominic, who was a republican, and Warner, who was a democrat
                    (both political appointees)all the CIA had to do was say something and that was
                    important. Of course, it wasn't important, but the mystique of the CIA had
                    really come through to these guys.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, there was a substantial presence of that agency
                        in Bern.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>ODELL: Oh, yes. But actually, that was one of the more pleasant aspects. When I
                    arrived, the station chief was a fellow named Fred Alner. He had had polio. That
                    is another thing. He had been in Indonesia and he had polio. The guy that
                    replaced Jack Morrie in Athens had been in India and he had had polio. My wife
                    always wondered whether the CIA had been experimenting on these guys. Fred had
                    this infirmity. He was quite reactionary in his attitudes, but was very bright
                    and a lot of fun to be with. I thoroughly enjoyed knowing Fred Alner. He is a
                    friend of mine until right now. I liked him a lot. I think he played pretty
                    fairly to me. This was a Stansfield Turner period. Fred would show me directives
                    he had gotten from Stansfield, which made it pretty clear that Turner didn't
                    want Fred getting too cozy with the State Department types. Fred would show me
                    these things. He would say, “You understand, Harry, that officially, I'm not
                    supposed to like you very much.” Matt Davis, because of this Chile thing, was
                    very afraid that he would be part of the CIA circle. But the other two guys...
                    Dominic wasn't there. He was sick and left quite soon. But Warner made his mark.
                    You hear these horror stories about political ambassadors, but the (horrible???)
                    thing about Warner was that he was basically good looking. He danced well. He
                    had a good singing voice. Women found him very attractive and he found women
                    very attractive. He was rich and bright. There is no doubt about it. Warner was
                    bright. But he was quite divorced from reality in that situation. Some of these
                    things are kind of funny. He had to present his credentials. The Swiss are quite
                    formal on that sort of thing. So, you had to wear morning clothes and so forth,
                    which I didn't own, but I rented. Marvin was getting all ready for this and was
                    quite interested and concerned. So, he asked me to come over to the residence
                    the day before and tell him what was going on. He said, “I want you to see my
                    clothes.” If you remember the old movies with chorus boys in the background
                    dancing and so forth, he had a very light outfit, tails, pants, and everything,
                    but it was... He said, “What's the matter?” I said, “Well, it isn't really what
                    you're supposed to be wearing.” He said, “Well, what am I supposed to be
                    wearing?” He said, “How the hell do I get that?” This was the day before. I
                    said, “Well, we'll go down to the place where I got mine.” So, he went down and
                    they fitted him. It didn't fit, but they got him an outfit that he wore.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>Then he was divorced and he liked girls. The CIA had a very attractive young
                    woman working for them, so he decided that she should be his companion and he
                    started going with her. Of course, new ambassadors immediately got on the
                    circuit that was being played by other ambassadors and so forth. So, he took
                    this gal with him. He went to one party, the Romanians. They didn't know that he
                    was brining this girl. They had to run around and find a place for her to sit
                    and so forth. He went down to Zurich and decided that a young Australian woman
                    who was working in the consulate general was very attractive, so he took up with
                    her. Then he took up with a very, very attractive young Swiss woman who worked
                    in the Consular Section of the embassy. He had these girlfriends. I'll say he
                    had good taste in girlfriends, but it wasn't really what he should have been
                    doing so overtly. If he wanted to do this sort of thing, for God's sake, go off
                    someplace and do it. He's Jewish. Alright. There was a Jewish community in
                    Switzerland, which was very old, had been there a long time. It was very well
                    integrated but was still a Jewish community. It was very dignified, very proper.
                    They decided this was the first Jewish American ambassador that had ever been
                    there (and there weren't very many Jewish ambassadors from any country, except
                    the Israeli, I guess) and that they would have a dinner in his honor in Zurich.
                    So, what does he do but show up with this Australian girl. I was told by a Swiss
                    banker, Hans Beyer... I said, “What happened” and he said, “Nothing happened. We
                    went ahead with the dinner, toasts, the welcome, and everything else, and just
                    pretended that this was perfectly normal. But it was very strange. People don't
                    understand that sort of thing. It's a strange thing to do when you think about
                    it.” But the climax came that carter was President at the time and he had a
                    secretary named Susan Clough. Warner had gotten to know her, so he invited her
                    to come over to Switzerland. But the occasion he chose was two big things a year
                    in the diplomatic community. The diplomatic corps (the ambassadors and charg�)
                    gave an annual white tie dinner in honor of the government of Switzerland. The
                    President would be the guest of honor and other the other consuls would be
                    there. Everybody of any importance would be there. When I was charg�, you were
                    notified by the dean of the diplomatic corps. When I was there, that would be
                    the Papal Nuncio, “Please pony up.” There was a lot of money that had to be put
                    up. This was done down in Belding Palace and it was a real big clambake. It cost
                    a lot. The Papal Nuncio made a speech and the President made a little
                    speech.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>Well, then the next thing was that the government, of course, gave a much lower
                    scale of party for the diplomatic corps. Warner decided he would invite Susan
                    over and she would go with him to the party that the diplomatic corps gave for
                    the government. Well, the problem was that it was made very, very clear... The
                    rule was that it was chiefs of mission and their spouses. If you didn't have a
                    spouse, you didn't bring anybody. That was the rule. So, one, he didn't have a
                    spouse; two, he didn't tell anybody that he was brining this woman. He showed up
                    late, of course, with Susan Clough. The drill at those things was that at the
                    Bellevue, you got there and there was a half hour of cocktail hour, if you will,
                    where you drank champagne and milled around. Then you would all troop in and
                    take your place. As charg�, I was way down at the table, you know. But anyhow,
                    then the festivities would continue. I wasn't there of course, but Warner showed
                    up at the end of the cocktail thing, just when they were just about ready to
                    move into the dining room, with Susan. At that point, the chief of protocol
                    realized what was going on here and he explained to Warner that there was no
                    seat for her. So, Warner went to the foreign minister and said, “This is the
                    President of the United States' secretary. You've got to have a place for her.”
                    The foreign minister said, “This is not my party. This is the diplomatic corps'
                    party. I am a guest here. I can't do anything about this.” So, the Papal
                    Nuncio's assistant, a young priest, tried to explain to him that there was
                    simply no seat for this woman at the table. So, they all went in and sat down.
                    By this time, everybody was buzzing, I gather. Warner came in alone and people
                    thought, “Well, he's going to go take his seat and that will be the end of it.”
                    He went up to the head table and spoke to the President of Switzerland and said
                    that he wanted this woman seated. The President was sitting there as the guest
                    of honor next to the Papal Nuncio said to him in effect, “Mr. Warner, I'm a
                    guest here. This is not my party.” So, he left. Boy did that cause some talk in
                    town! That really caused some talk in town! He thought for a couple of years
                    that I had told the press. Not one word appeared in the Swiss press, but it got
                    into the Herald Tribune, I think, and others. The thought I had told the press,
                    but I didn't. I ran into him two or three years later and told him I absolutely
                    did not leak any of it to the press corps. The only thing I had done was, the
                    next day, I had gone down to the foreign office and quietly asked if I could see
                    the chief of protocol and asked him to tell me what had gone on. I wanted to
                    know. He told me.</p>
                <p>I don't know whether Warner served out his full term or not, but he got in
                    trouble with the banking regulatory authorities. He went to jail for a couple of
                    years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any major issues going on at that time in Swiss
                        American relations, the banking?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>ODELL: Yes. The very early flurries of what in recent times became an issue, this
                    bank secrecy question. The Swiss banks, ironically, were taking the position
                    when I got there, that they had to have this bank secrecy. “Look how much good
                    work we did in World War II protecting all these Jews and others from having
                    their money confiscated by the Nazis.” The big issue we had (and my name was on
                    one of the documents) was, we were attempting to negotiate what was called
                    officially a judicial assistance treaty in which... Shelby Cullom Davis had been
                    involved in this. For certain types of offenses, the Swiss would agree to make
                    available or allow banks to make available to our investigators documents
                    necessary to prosecute somebody under quite restricted circumstances. But we had
                    persuaded them that it would be in their own best interests to relax to some
                    extent on the bank secrecy question. The Swiss were always double edged. It
                    forbade a bank or anybody working for a bank to release the information and it
                    forbade anybody to seek the information. You could get put in jail for going
                    around asking a banker these questions and if the banker answered the questions,
                    he could go to jail. So, the idea was that we were pursuing people for income
                    tax evasion. Well, income tax invasion is not a crime under Swiss law. It is an
                    offense or something, but it is not a crime, not something you go to jail for.
                    So, he would do that. But the idea was that if somebody was laundering money
                    they had gotten in the drug trade or something like that, under limited
                    circumstances, we would be allowed access.</p>
                <p>But the question of the bank accounts of Jews and others from World War II, that
                    came up a couple of times. The Swiss at that time took the position that they
                    had done all the investigating necessary and there wasn't any money. I didn't
                    believe them for one minute, nor did anybody else. There had to be more money
                    than that. Come on! People have been putting their money in Switzerland since
                    the French Revolution and before. These Jews and others, any sensible person
                    with money in Europe for generations has always stashed some of it in
                    Switzerland or someplace. So, it stood to reason that even if they weren't
                    trying to evade the Nazis per se, there were bound to have been affluent Jews
                    and other affluent people who had money in Swiss banks and when the great
                    cataclysm of World War II came, that money would have been bound to have been
                    there. I tried to tell them after I was working for them in the American Swiss
                    Association that this is not going to go away, fellows, this is going to come up
                    sooner or later. Of course, it did. I think Shelby Cullom Davis thought the same
                    way. He became president of the American Swiss Association later on. I think he
                    felt that they were being a little bit foolish in being quite so difficult.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>You've brought me pretty close to the end of my career. I retired and took this
                    job as executive director of the American Swiss association, which had been
                    formed after World War II. During World War II, particularly in the latter part
                    of it, American Swiss relations got kind of nasty. Once we no longer found
                    Switzerland useful as a neutral island in the middle of warring Europe, we began
                    pushing them pretty hard for their relations with the Germans during the war.
                    Some Swiss properties in the United States were seized and things were kind of
                    unpleasant. So, a small group of Americans and Swiss who had dealt with each
                    other for generationthey weren't quite clear how they would do this, but they
                    formed a little group called the American Swiss Association to sort of keep in
                    touch with each other and through business connections to kind of keep channels
                    open so these things didn't happen again. They had a very distinguished list of
                    corporations and individuals who belonged, but they didn't do very much. The
                    executive director at the time was an aging public relations fellow. He was
                    leaving them and they were casting around for a successor. At the time, I had
                    become quite sure by then that the Department wasn't going to make me an
                    ambassador. I didn't know what to do at that point, whether to just sweat out my
                    remaining time or what. I talked to some people, talked to my wife, and decided
                    that that job would be good, so I did and worked for them for five years.</p>
                <p>It was very hard to develop a tangible program because there wasn't anything
                    tangible really to work with. But what we did with some success was, we tried to
                    get prominent American political figures to visit Switzerland under very nice
                    but very informal circumstances to get them to know some Swiss and know
                    Switzerland a little bit better in case some problem came up. We were focusing
                    on senators. We did get several senators to come to Switzerland. Who was that
                    big tall senator from California who after he retired got into trouble? Well, we
                    started with him and then word of mouth... Bradley was on the list, as was John
                    Glenn. Who was the senator from Massachusetts who developed cancer? Brooke. And
                    the Utah senator who went up with the astronauts. Anyhow, what we got was, these
                    guys would come over. They would get first class travel over and back with their
                    wife. They would spend about a week in Switzerland and to keep the Senate Ethics
                    Committee off their back, they would give a lecture at the university or the
                    technical institute or whatever. Then they would be guests of Switzerland and
                    treated very nicely and assigned as their control officer, if you will, or
                    escort officer, would be a Swiss senator. I don't know any of them who didn't
                    thoroughly enjoy this and come back with the feeling that the Swiss are pretty
                    good guys. It was very difficult to get it going consistently. If you've ever
                    tried to get a U.S. senator to do something and pin him down if he in fact is
                    going to do this... Who was the one from Oregon, not the one who got in trouble?
                    He had been governor of Oregon? He was all set to go and at the last minute had
                    to cancel. That put the Swiss into an awful tizzy because they had made lots of
                    plans. He came up to New York and talked to us. We had lunches in New York.
                    Visiting Swiss dignitaries would come and we would arrange luncheons and things
                    like that. I did that for five years. We were living up in New York and still
                    had a house in Glen Echo and decided that I would come back to Washington. So I
                    left there and came back down. I worked in Freedom of Information and luckily
                    got assigned to USIA as the only declassifier working there.</p>
