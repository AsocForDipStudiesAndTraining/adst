                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an interview with Richard A. Dwyer. I am Charles
                        Stuart Kennedy and this is being done on behalf of the Foreign Affairs Oral
                        History Program. I wonder if you could tell me a bit about your background.
                        Where did you come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: I was born in Chicago, the suburbs of Chicago, and raised in a small town
                    in Indiana, Michigan City, about 50 miles outside of Chicago. I went to public
                    high school in Michigan City, and had four years of college at Dartmouth and
                    then a couple of years at the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton for an MPA and
                    then directly into the Foreign Service—interrupted briefly by the army and then
                    back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any overseas in the army?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: No, none whatsoever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you become interested in foreign affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: I had been interested in foreign affairs all through high school. I had
                    participated in several mock United Nations conferences sponsored by, I can't
                    think who now, I guess the Rotary or some service club in Cincinnati. I had gone
                    to summer school at the University of Geneva after graduating from high school,
                    and I spent a summer working in the vineyards in Burgundy while I was in
                    college. I had always intended to do that. My father had a manufacturing
                    business and I had two older brothers. I certainly did not want to be the
                    youngest brother in that. I was the youngest child, actually. I had looked at
                    three or four different things. The CIA, which I found not to my taste, not that
                    I really knew much about it because as I recall the interviewer at graduate
                    school said we won't tell you what you do until after we hire you. The only real
                    runner up to the Foreign Service was what was then the Office of the Budget,
                    which was in the mid-50's a very attractive place with a lot of interesting
                    people, high-powered young people, but I think the travel in the Foreign Service
                    and the world at large were the main things. I took the exam in the Spring of my
                    first year at Princeton.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was when you were at the Woodrow Wilson School?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Yes, the Woodrow Wilson School was a two-year and a summer program for a
                    Masters in Public Affairs designed specifically at that time for people who were
                    not going on to academic life. At that time I think we had about 15 people in my
                    class at the graduate school. Now that I think about it was 1956 that I took the
                    exam because I remember vividly that a couple of people flunked out but came
                    into the Foreign Service by being promoted when the Wristonization people...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the three and a half day exam wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Yes, I guess it was—no, I don't think it was. I only remember a day's
                    exam. It was extra long because they inadvertently gave us the civil service
                    exam first and when we were done with it they apologized and said, “You that the
                    wrong exam. Do you want to wait until the next time it is given or shall we
                    start at it now?” So we started at it “now.” It was a long, long day. It seemed
                    like three days, I must say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have here that you came in in 1958, was that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: No, not quite. I came in in August, 1957 and had the basic training course
                    and then went on leave to go into the army for six months as a reserve and then
                    I came back in August of '58 so in effect I did begin in 1958.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1958 your first assignment was where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: To the Office of Functional and Biographic Intelligence as a Class 8,
                    executive assistant to the Office Director. At the time it was the largest
                    office in the Bureau of Intelligence and Research largely because it still had
                    the biographic record keeping function, but a few years later it was given over
                    to the Agency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing mainly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: My job was basically a staff aide job. I ran the office for the Office
                    Director. Helped his secretaries schedule his meetings, read his mail and sorted
                    it for him and tried to separate what was important from what was not. Basically
                    a general helpmate including stealing a davenport from another office.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was Director of the Office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Well, it was one of the very many Johnsons. Richard A. Johnson who had
                    been Deputy Chief of Mission in Madrid and he came back to be Director of the
                    Office. He had spent a large part of his career in Latin America and Spain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel, I mean this is your first time
                        looking at the organization, of the role INR played there, did you feel you
                        were off in a obscure corner or did you feel that you were involved in
                        things, or at least your office was involved in things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Well, I didn't feel that I was off in an obscure corner, I KNEW I was off
                    in an obscure corner. But the whole Bureau at that time, and probably largely
                    still, is a somewhat obscure part of the Department of State. At that time,
                    however, I think of my entering class—20 or 30 people—there were no more than
                    one or two that were assigned overseas because of the integration of the civil
                    service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the Wriston program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: The Wristonization had largely filled up the overseas slots and I actually
                    considered myself lucky because it was an interesting job and I had several of
                    my classmates who were assigned to the passport offices. One poor fellow from El
                    Paso who I think had joined the Foreign Service to get away from a
                    mother-in-law, found himself back in El Paso, or wherever it was, issuing
                    passports to all his friends who went to Europe on occasion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, your first overseas assignment was to Damascus in
                        1960 where you served until 1963.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Well, inadvertently, I must say. There was a brief assignment between. I
                    had a chance to work on the Antarctic Treaty program for the duration of the
                    Antarctic Treaty until early 1960. It was very interesting. One of the few real
                    world treaty conferences that wasn't under the auspice of the United Nations and
                    it was a great experience.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>I had naively requested a French speaking post. Personnel decided that Saigon
                    would be a nice place for me. I was not too keen on Saigon and to my surprise
                    they came up with Damascus which never entered my mind. I was thinking of
                    Algeria or Morocco. They needed someone in Damascus badly because my predecessor
                    had resigned mid-tour and went home so it was one of those things that if you
                    can go tomorrow you can have it. So, we left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Syria at that time? We are
                        talking about the early 1960s.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Syria at that time was still part of the United Arab Republic which
                    consisted of Syria and Egypt. I can't recall now, but at one point there was
                    Yemen in there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was always coming in and out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Yes, yes, they were sewing stars on the flag and taking them off. In fact
                    it was a fascinating time to be there. A year after we got there on September
                    28, 1961, as I recall, the Syrians in effect revolted and Syria became an
                    independent country again. For a period of another year and a half or so, Syria
                    had a more or less democratic government for the last time since the Baaths took
                    over in 1963. So you had, unfortunately a series of governments that were trying
                    to find their way, but for a junior officer on a first assignment this country
                    was a great place to be. You knew people. As a third secretary I had friends in
                    the cabinet, almost unheard of in other countries at that level. Of course the
                    cabinet kept changing all the time, so sooner or later you knew most
                    everybody.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume this was a fairly small embassy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Yes, it was. When I arrived it was a consulate general which it had become
                    upon the union of Syria and Egypt. We had a consulate general in Damascus which
                    had formerly been the embassy and another consulate general in Aleppo. The staff
                    in Damascus included myself, the junior officer as economic/commercial officer,
                    three or four political officers, a couple of which were with the Agency, a
                    consular section and administrative section, and a small AID group plus a
                    military attach� office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the hand of Egypt at that time? There was
                        this sort of peculiar union at the height of Nasserism and all that, but
                        what was the consulate general's impression of this union?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>DWYER: Well, it was still getting it's feet on the ground and it still was not
                    working. The vice president, General Omer [ph], was an Egyptian and he was
                    rather the viceroy. As a matter of fact he lived across the street from us which
                    was the cause of everybody's car getting shot up but mine when the separation
                    came. Basically the Syrians have been divided ethnically and geographically by
                    the French under the mandate in the ''20s and for quite a while before had never
                    really had a country with real borders. The Baaths and the Ban [ph] Arabs
                    considered greater Syria to run from the Nile over to Baghdad and most certainly
                    including Beirut and all of Lebanon to say nothing of the lower part of Turkey
                    that the French had given away in the ''30s to make amends with the Turks. They
                    had therefore the Druids in the south, the Alawites which the current President
                    is from, and all kinds of minorities. The problem was that the most radical
                    proposals drove out almost anything of any moderation. You could not be a Syrian
                    politician at that time or probably even today and not be radically
                    anti-Israeli, of course, because this would expose your party or group to the
                    people who were even more radical. So therefore even though there were
                    surprisingly many good people in the government—by good people I mean competent
                    technicians that were looking towards the economic development of the country
                    rather than the political aggrandizement of it—their voice was pretty much
                    stifled through that whole period. After the country again became independent
                    and in the interval, I must say, and after that we went through a dozen or
                    eighteen coup d'etats and attempted coup d'etats, it was a regular occurrence,
                    there were a succession of governments that never really managed to get a
                    hold...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was after the ending of the....</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Yes, and even before there were a couple of bootleg attempts at coups that
                    failed. I remember a birthday party at Les Polk's [ph] house...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Les Polk being...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Les Polk was my immediate superior who became the senior
                    economic/commercial officer after I had been there for a few months. Les was an
                    Arabic specialist and spoke beautiful French. He had been in the army during the
                    Second World War—a captain so he was a little older than the average. He was
                    also a little unusual in that he was black—there were very few black officers
                    in...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had been in Saudi Arabia before that...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>DWYER: That is correct. He was quite a character. In any event, Les' eldest child
                    had a birthday and was the same age as our girl, or a little older. So all the
                    children were at that birthday party together with one of the grandmas visiting
                    from the States when one of the coups came along. The standard procedure there
                    was to gather the family—there were hardly any houses in Damascus as nearly
                    everyone lived in apartments—and usually go into the kitchen since it was
                    generally in the center of the apartment and there were fewer windows there.
                    After the coup had been going for some time, the grandmother from the States
                    told all the children that these were fireworks in connection with the child's
                    birthday. I was one of the few who could get away easily from where I was and I
                    dropped over to make sure that everybody was all right because we were
                    immediately under curfew. My daughter came up to me and said, “Daddy don't tell
                    grandma X there is a coup on. She thinks it is for the birthday.” I think I had
                    the only 3 year old who could tell the difference between a 35mm and 50mm
                    machine gun.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Well, they probably were pretty much the same as they are today. The
                    political situation in some ways and indeed the environment has changed
                    remarkably little over the odd years. Our primary client then as now was Israel.
                    In the early ''60s we could make, perhaps, a little bit more of a case that the
                    United States was attempting to be neutral in Arab-Israeli affairs. Secondly,
                    since the '56 war, there had been no French embassy in Damascus or British
                    embassy there. And in the ''60s still...</p>

                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Suez Crisis, that's right. And in the ''60s the French and British were
                    still major players. As a matter of fact, certainly the French still are today.
                    The French traditionally served as protector of Christian interests in
                    Lebanon—all Syrians then and I suppose now still consider Lebanon as part of
                    greater Syria. I think probably we were playing a little more of a role because
                    of the absence of the French and the British until 1961 or 2, I forget when they
                    came back. Beyond that we had the oil pipelines...</p>

                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>DWYER: Tapline, precisely. It had been cut off by the first war of Israeli
                    independence and there was still hopes at that time that that might be reopened.
                    We had the same interests then as we do now. The hope is that Syria might itself
                    be sufficiently stable so that it might play a stabilizing role in the area
                    being the country where internationally as domestically the most radical
                    government was the one that achieved popular support for a brief period. I refer
                    to it as democratic governments, but they certainly were not democratic
                    governments in any sense we knew or know now, but they were democratic in the
                    sense that until the Baath took over there was a kind of live and let live
                    attitude toward political turmoil. If you were a colonel and didn't make
                    brigadier you tried for president or prime minister and if missed, nothing too
                    bad happened to you. Usually you were made military attach� somewhere depending
                    on the quality of the coup you attempted. After the Baath came in, particularly
                    the hardline wing of the Baath, you stood a pretty good chance of being stood
                    against the wall and shot.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Yes. It was in August of 1963. As a matter of fact we were growing
                    suspicious, I think it may have been August 18 or 28, every coup seemed to
                    happen on a date with an eight in it. Anyway it was about that time. After I
                    left to go to Egypt, Assad finally achieved power as an Alawite and remarkably
                    enough has stayed in power until today.</p>

                        party before they took over and at the time of the coup that brought them to
                        power?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Well, there were two major wings of the Baath party—Oh, golly, I should
                    have gone over all the names...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Actually, we can add the names.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: The principal founder of the Baath party fled to exile in Eastern Europe,
                    I think Bulgaria, for quite a while. You had then the Baath supported by the
                    Iraqi Baath party that had come in and these two wings of the Baath party were
                    different. I left Syria in the Fall of '63 so it was only a couple of months
                    after the Baaths had come in. I don't think that we had any particular feeling
                    for the Baath as a whole, except generically. We didn't like radical socialists
                    and we didn't like people who might come back to power from Eastern Europe.
                    Beyond the coterie of Arabists in the State Department whose influence was not
                    particularly great, I think, in the overall aspects of American foreign policy
                    in those years, there wasn't much of anyone, I would guess, who knew much about
                    them or cared greatly.</p>

                        your first look at it. Was this a different breed of cat, I'm talking about
                        the Foreign Service Officers who could be called Arabists?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: To some extent it was. The Arabists in the State Department are not in the
                    same category as the British nomads of the desert to the people who fell in love
                    with the Sheik to the south, although we had a few of those too. But basically
                    the main thing, I suppose, that characterized the Arabists of that time was the
                    fact that since the Suez War, the '56 war, there have been a large number of
                    embassy and post closings and there were a lot of people with a great deal of
                    time and career invested in the language and in the area who were looking for
                    jobs. Beyond that, at the post itself, we really had only two or three people
                    who would describe themselves as real Arabists. Curt Jones, the head of the
                    political section, was certainly one of those. He spoke good Arabic, as the
                    Arabs say, he speaks Arabic-like words. In the station there was one officer
                    married to an Lebanese woman, whose Arabic was pretty good and...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that Archie Roosevelt?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: No, Roosevelt was a few years before. As a matter of fact I occupied his
                    office and the local employees always delighted in showing me where the Israelis
                    strafed it. We still had a bullet mark or a fragmentation bomb, or something
                    like that. Actually, Roosevelt's ties were not unknown and even then... We had a
                    remarkably good military attach� whose name I can't think of at the moment, but
                    he did more and better work as a military attach� than almost any one of the
                    breed that I have encountered since. When I left Damascus and went over to
                    Cairo, where we had a military attach� office of 60-odd people, and 27
                    accredited attach�s, the whole bunch of them could not begin to turn out the
                    work that the guy in Syria could with a sergeant and a lieutenant.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling towards Israel? The attitude of the
                        Embassy and your attitude at that time. This was before our major commitment
                        to Israel which came after the '67 war. But obviously they were our
                        principal beneficiary in the Middle East, I suppose.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: I should say again that this was my first assignment, brand new right out
                    of graduate school, not terribly sophisticated, and perhaps overly idealistic. I
                    guess I should preface it by saying that I ended up spending three years there
                    in my first assignment which from a career standpoint was probably a mistake,
                    but I had been asked to do so and as a result I had probably a better grasp of
                    the community than most of the Embassy did who were changing at eighteen months
                    and two years. I still thought at the time that we could still be even handed in
                    our foreign policy. By even handed I mean that Israel would not be as much as a
                    favored part of our foreign policy as it became.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>I felt at the time and to some extent still do that if it were not for Israel,
                    the Arabs would have had to invent one. It gave the disparate political and
                    ethnic Arab groups something to unite against—about the only thing they had. My
                    Arab friends, as an economic officer, were extremely shortsighted economically
                    if they didn't have a fifty percent profit in six months they were not
                    interested in it. But politically, even then, they remembered that the Kingdom
                    of Jerusalem had lasted only a hundred years and the Arabs were patient and
                    there were a great many more Arabs than Israelis and it might take another
                    hundred years—mind you this was in the 1960s—but eventually that territory would
                    become Arab once more.</p>
                <p>I think that undoubtedly the refugee problem was the greatest difficulty. The
                    Palestinians in Syria had been in refugee camps for 13 years or so and it is
                    hard to believe they are still there today. But at that time in the ''60s the
                    Palestinians, as they were called and called themselves, in general were a more
                    sophisticated, better educated group of people than the average Syrian. They
                    were also, thanks to the British Mandate, more western-American-British oriented
                    than the Syrians who had never been under the British Mandate. And they offered
                    a pool of experience and talent that, unfortunately, was not used to the extent
                    it might have been. Even now, looking back when I think of my Syrian or
                    Palestinians friends, the entrepreneurs were Palestinians—the guy who built the
                    match factory. Except for the traditional upper class Syrians, the middle and
                    lower class Palestinians were probably better trained and educated. I presume
                    that in the last 30 years that it has been largely dissipated now.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would imagine so. In the camps they wouldn't be getting

                </p>
                <p>DWYER: And most of them got out. I don't know if we ever could have put enough
                    pressure on the Syrians and the other Arabs to assimilate the Palestinians. It
                    was politically impossible, of course, because to do so would have meant that
                    they accepted the state of Israel. Nonetheless, still I have often thought that
                    something could have been worked out even if they just gave them citizenship and
                    maintain their Palestinian citizenship or something like that. But for political
                    reasons it was a tool as was Israel. Things could still be worked out.</p>
                <p>My wife was pregnant when we got there. We were very naive and idealistic at that
                    time. I would never years later after I became more experienced have taken a
                    pregnant young woman out of the United States for the first time to Syria. But
                    there was the American University hospital in Beirut and we were told that this
                    was superb. But it turned out we wished we had stayed in Damascus and used a
                    Damascian doctor who trained in Cleveland. We would have been much better off
                    than with the American doctor in Beirut. The baby was due in January, and it was
                    decided that the best thing to do was for my wife to go over early and have
                    labor induced. We were getting a little antsy because we thought the doctor was
                    leaving this a little bit late. There were no modern hospital facilities in
                    Damascus.</p>

                <p>When the time was due to go, the passes were closed with snow and there was no
                    way that we could drive over and the airline said they wouldn't take her, and it
                    probably wouldn't have been a good idea to fly out anyway. So through friends in
                    the government and the foreign office and in the military we arranged for Sally
                    and myself to be able to drive down through southern Syria and southern Lebanon,
                    which was a closed military zone, and of course we also needed the okay from the
                    Israelis. All of which we got with remarkably little effort. I'm very fond of
                    the Syrian people there, they just couldn't have been nicer.</p>
                <p>We drove over on a cold January morning, across the mountains and down the Bekaa
                    Valley to Marjayoun in the south on roads that hadn't seen civilian traffic
                    since the war of independence and were nothing but potholes, you know, where
                    tracked vehicles had been over it. We saw a part of the border area there that
                    we otherwise would not have seen. Then we hit the coast and drove back up to
                    Beirut. But such things were possible then. A couple of years later when the
                    Baaths came in that was unheard of.</p>

                        menace?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Well, it was very real. I managed to get a whole issue of a newspaper
                    confiscated by the Syrian government one time, thanks to an interview I gave to
                    a Lebanese journalist, typical Foreign Service officer prejudice being built
                    early against journalists. But in fact, except for the fact that he quoted an
                    embassy officer as a source and the whole of Syria knew who it was, I didn't
                    have any real complaint. What he quoted was my statement that at the time on a
                    per capita basis Syria was getting more Soviet aid than any other country in the
                    world—which was quite true. But this did not make the Syrian government happy—a
                    few years later they would not have minded, but at that time they did. They
                    grabbed every copy of the newspaper in town, called the Ambassador in and said
                    would you shut Dwyer up, please—and told me to shut up too. In effect, the
                    Soviets main contribution was military. That was what we were particularly
                    interested in in a particularly backhanded way I sometimes thought. I can
                    remember, I have movies of the Syrian independence day where 6 MiGs overflew it
                    and we didn't know that they had six MiGs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: MiGs being a Soviet type plane.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Yes, the Soviet fighter of the day. I don't know what they were—19 or
                    something, anyway the new model. And we didn't know they had these new models or
                    at least that they had as many as six. This was of interest to Washington. I
                    reported it and the military attach� reported it, and the Station chief reported
                    it, I suppose. A few months later when the annual agency report on the military
                    establishments came out they had them down as three. I sent a wire in saying
                    what is this we saw six. We got a wire back saying they had two reports, one
                    saying they had none and one saying they had six so we gave them three.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>This was one of our major interests—it certainly was one of the major interests
                    of the Agency at that time. The Soviet embassy had an enormous KGB contingent,
                    and at one time kidnapped one of our Embassy officers, shot him full of drugs
                    and pumped him for what he knew, and fortunately released him unharmed—well,
                    they beat him up pretty badly but at least he came back, which was obviously
                    rare. Nothing great was made about it publicly, of course, but it was indicative
                    of the competition or the conflict.</p>
                <p>We had another instance where a good friend of mine, Fairham Atassi [ph], who was
                    an American citizen and Syrian citizen, and he was a businessman, a young man,
                    our age, a junior officer age, so he was a good friend of all the junior
                    officers. His wife was of Syrian extraction but born in New York. He had a
                    couple of grandiose projects including building the railroad that Lawrence had
                    destroyed all the way back to Mecca...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Hejaz railway.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: The Hejaz railway, which never has been rebuilt. Brown construction
                    company was interested in this and a few other things. Anyway he was a member of
                    a very prominent Syrian family. The Atassis were—there was a cousin who was a
                    prime minister at that time. Fairham presumed he was immune from any serious
                    repercussions from his actions because of his American citizenship, although I
                    personally told him he was not, because of his Syrian citizenship, and so did
                    the consular officer. Anyway he was alleged to have been recruited by the Agency
                    and although I went on record early on and so did a couple of others, saying
                    that this was a man who was not stable, he drank too much, he talked too much.
                    After a few drinks he grew very expansive. And furthermore he was on the very
                    fringes of his family. In any event he was alleged to have been recruited as an
                    American spy and a few months after I left Syria, he had been charged before I
                    left I think, he was taken out and hung in the public square. I forget what
                    minister it was, the Minister of Public Work or something, happened to have an
                    office overlooking the square and on some pretext had requested the American
                    Ambassador to call upon him and out his window was Fairham Atassi's body.</p>
                <p>Obviously by that time our relations with Syria were pretty much at the breaking
                    point. Our Ambassador at that time, Ridgway Knight, was quoted in Time
                    magazine—he was asked by Time why he was not more outspoken on these questions
                    and he said very succinctly, “I learned early in my Foreign Service career you
                    do not get into fighting matches with skunks.”</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>I left Syria in the Fall of '63 and the cordial relations of the Embassy with the
                    Syrian government ended shortly thereafter—certainly with the hanging of Fairham
                    and his wife and children were later spirited over the border and back into the
                    United States. It always was not only a sad and bitter memory to me because I
                    liked Fairham and we saw him fairly frequently, but it always seemed to me a
                    case of the people who are responsible for and train in the art of covert
                    activities get very frustrated when they have nothing to do. They tend to try to
                    put some of their spy craft in operation often losing sight of the over all
                    objectives of American foreign policy which in the long scheme of things many of
                    these minor operations produce no historic benefit to speak of but are capable
                    of producing an historic embarrassment to no good end.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now you were a direct transfer to Cairo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Yes. I had had an assignment to Casablanca at the end of two years which
                    sounded real good to me. That's where I originally was interested in going.
                    Ridgway Knight, our Ambassador in Syria, of whom I was, and still am, very, very
                    fond, called me in and said, “Dick, I know you want this assignment, but I have
                    interviewed your replacement and I don't think he is the man for the job and I
                    would like you to stay on for another year. I will see that you get a good job.”
                    I was young enough and naive enough to think that ambassadors could actually do
                    that. I did stay on for another year and when the time came to transfer I was in
                    effect handed by Ambassador Knight to his good friend the Deputy Chief of
                    Mission over in Cairo who was looking for a staff aide for the ambassador. This
                    came as a surprise to me because my wife and I had just spent two weeks of our
                    leave traveling throughout Egypt never knowing when we were going to get back to
                    the Middle East again. I had also considered and decided against Arabic language
                    training and here I found myself right back in the area, just across the river
                    in Egypt.</p>
                <p>At that time John Badeau was our Ambassador in Egypt, a Kennedy appointee who had
                    some thirty years in the Arabic world. He had been president of the American
                    University in Cairo, was an engineer and minister. His Deputy at the time was
                    Bill Boswell, who had come from a job as head of some office in security. The
                    embassies were totally different in the sense that Embassy Damascus was—well,
                    when we first got to Damascus it was a miserable post, people weren't talking to
                    each other. We were there in a hotel room, my wife pregnant, and it was six
                    weeks before anyone invited us out for a drink, dinner, or anything else.
                    Finally the Station Chief took us under his wing and then fortunately the Chief
                    of Mission, who was a bit of an alcoholic and I think a large part of the
                    problem, was transferred and it became an excellent post with everyone working
                    together. A true country team with all agencies getting along well. Everyone
                    felt they were doing something.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>To go from a small embassy like Damascus into Cairo which was 350-400 people at
                    the time—enormous to my eyes—was quite a change. Of course there was none of the
                    family feeling of the small embassy in the big one. But Bill Boswell wanted an
                    office manager and he being a good friend of my ambassador in Cairo I was handed
                    over. It was a fascinating three years in Cairo as staff aide, executive
                    assistant, or whatever title I held [there were several]. It was kind of fun
                    because in the ambassadorial area there were only myself and the Minister and
                    the secretaries of the Ambassador, Minister and myself, and an Egyptian social
                    secretary. So being next to the source of power was almost like being there—I
                    tried to remember none of the power really was mine! The reverse side of the
                    coin was that I had no real work of my own to do that took me out into the
                    Egyptian community. As a matter of fact, I had to be very careful about my
                    contacts, not only with the Egyptians but with the enormous press corps we had
                    there. Rick Smith, was head of the New York Times bureau and a terribly
                    persistent person. The aide was always the target for all these people if they
                    couldn't get in to see the Ambassador or the Minister. But it was very
                    interesting.</p>
                <p>John Badeau pretty much ignored the rest of the world and most of his Embassy. He
                    dealt with Gamal Abdel Nasser. When he was leaving and we were waiting for a new
                    ambassador I compiled a book for the new ambassador that consisted of the
                    forty-odd conversations that Badeau had had with Gamal Abdel Nasser. I indexed
                    them by topics, etc. It was kind of like a joke because he would go down and say
                    to Nasser, “The American policy is this,” and Nasser would respond with
                    something like the famous convention, the comedians, you could give the numbers,
                    go in and say “42” and Nasser would say “46.” But Nasser was completely
                    accessible to Ambassador Badeau for most of the time. I wonder what ever
                    happened to the book?</p>
                <p>Ambassador Badeau and his wife were older than the average. They had no interest,
                    whatsoever, in the local diplomatic corps which was 120 members. He felt, quite
                    rightly I think, that he wasn't there to talk with the other diplomats, which
                    meant his DCM was saddled with that. Not a terribly unpleasant responsibility,
                    but still, if he were not an Arabist, why he was less interested in the inner
                    workings of the Arab world than were the political section or economic
                    section.</p>
                <p>We had an enormous AID program. We had eight people tripping over each other and
                    us. We had these 50-odd people in the military attach� office, two airplanes
                    plus a military air transport office, plus a navy medical research unit that had
                    been there since '46 and even stayed after the '67 war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was when technically our Embassy closed down but we
                        kept what amounted to an Interest Section.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>DWYER: Well, I will say we saw it coming and I still have framed somewhere, or at
                    least on a scroll, my exequatur as a consular officer because the Ambassador
                    looked rattled and his political officer, Don Burgess, said, “Let's make
                    everybody that you might want to stay a consular officer as well as diplomatic
                    officers so that if we all get kicked out we can stay as consular officers.” It
                    didn't work, they kicked them all out anyway. I think that Don Burgess had in
                    mind that he was going to end up as head of an American Interest Section
                    somewhere, but unfortunately he did not. Interestingly enough about the same
                    time I think I finally got promoted. We got there in November of '63 and
                    President Kennedy was assassinated shortly after we arrived and I have the
                    commissions appointing me as a consular officer in addition to a secretary
                    because of this request for the exequatur, signed purportedly by Lyndon Johnson
                    ten days before Kennedy was assassinated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression and maybe others in the Embassy
                        you were talking to, of the effectiveness of Badeau as an ambassador, or the
                        influence of the United States in Egypt on Nasser at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Well, what leverage we had was in large part dependent on foreign aid and,
                    of course, the Aswan Dam was the most obvious example there. But I felt then and
                    I have often felt since that Washington, the Congress and even the Department of
                    State didn't seem to realize that this is a coin that can only be spent once.
                    You can't continually threaten taking it away because if you do why it is crying
                    wolf and nobody will believe you. If you do so, why then what do you do as a
                    follow-up?</p>
                <p>Our AID program at that time was, as I said, highly extensive and interestingly
                    enough there was a program started under Bill Crockett in the Department of
                    State at the time and which was an attempt to organize the Department, and
                    particularly the overseas embassies tightly along the lines of American policy
                    interests. In other words, we have x number of dollars...and this was also
                    thanks to the Kennedy letter giving the ambassador much more formal authority
                    than ever before in running his embassy. The idea was working through the
                    embassies rather than the Department where the ambassadors did have this
                    Executive Order and letter from the President we might be better able to tailor
                    our resources overseas, than we could directly from Washington. The Department
                    of State in Washington could not then, and still can not, influence as much as
                    it thinks it should the activities of the other agencies abroad and of course
                    the Department's philosophy has always been if you can get someone else to pay
                    for it we don't care how many people you have. Anyway, as part of this there
                    came to be a program where, on an experimental basis, each embassy was assigned
                    resources which would include one executive assistant and a secretary who would
                    run this experimental program in embassies around the world.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>By this time Luc Battle was the ambassador and he was an excellent
                    intra-Departmental politician, having been Executive Secretary of the Department
                    and an Assistant Secretary before he came out there. The Department had a few
                    secrets as to how it worked. He said, “What do you think about this executive
                    assistant, what shall we do about it? Shall we refuse it or—I'm not sure I can
                    easily refuse it or even should I?” And my feeling was let's take it as long as
                    I'm it—because as aide to the ambassador I really didn't want an executive
                    assistant there—and I said furthermore it comes with a secretary and we never
                    have enough secretaries. So that is what we did. This program consisted of
                    requesting, if you can imagine such a thing, the 350 people to keep track of
                    their day in 15-minute segments as to what they did. We had space for going to
                    the john and space for unlocking safes in the morning and the whole bit. There
                    were interviews. I don't know if we interviewed them all, but we had a team come
                    out from Washington to do this—a half a dozen people. I think we interviewed
                    almost everybody of a substantial nature in the Department of State, I don't
                    know if we got down to the well diggers or not. Probably not the technicians in
                    AID, but most everybody else.</p>
                <p>The idea was to compare this survey with a country policy paper that was to be
                    drafted first by the Embassy. The Embassy was, I think in our case, to write the
                    first draft of what American policy should be towards Egypt. Then this policy
                    paper would go back to Washington where it would be approved on an interagency
                    level. It would come back to the field and after all the information of a couple
                    of weeks work of what people actually did, these duties would be assigned to
                    policy topics by me or by the team. Then we would try to see if we were spending
                    our resources in the correct manner. We evaluated all resources in terms of time
                    and money. Time was people, and money was obviously money and projects.</p>
                <p>There was a tremendous amount of money spent on this thing. It went around the
                    world. I don't know how many embassies were doing this. Of course, it ran into
                    every kind of prejudice that old line Foreign Service Officers ever had. But Luc
                    Battle was perhaps unusual in that he said, “Go ahead and do it. I will support
                    the project and try to go along with it completely.”</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>The Station Chief took me aside out to lunch one day, which he normally did not
                    do, and we had a few drinks and he said, “You know you are not going to really
                    ask what all my resources are out there.” And I said, “Yes, we are not making
                    substantive judgments on what they do, but the Ambassador does want to do it.”
                    He said, “I will give you some numbers, but you know Dick...” I said, “Luc
                    Battle said he is going to do this so we can go on.” I think the Station Chief
                    was amazed when the final thing came through and said we had too many people
                    here as far as the Ambassador was concerned. He said, “They are not contributing
                    to my carrying out of American foreign policy. That is not to say that they do
                    not have missions on a global area, for example, of Soviet interests and
                    penetration that are completely separate from American-Egyptian interests. But
                    as far as American-Egyptian interests are concerned, why we can do with
                    something about half this size”—which made me very popular with the Station
                    Chief. Even less popular with the military attach� office where the Ambassador
                    thought two or three would do nicely, thank you. I will say we had at that time
                    a couple of senior military officers there who had personal problems and did not
                    give much leadership to their staff. We also had some very good professional
                    junior military officers that did a superb job including Gary Siolc, who later
                    became famous as the White House man on Iran.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Iran, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: While we had a number of good professional intelligence people we had an
                    awful lot of support people out there maintaining these people in a style they
                    would like to become accustomed. We even found people we didn't know we had.
                    There was one guy who had been there forever and I always assumed he worked for
                    the Agency and the Agency finally said, “He doesn't work for us”. I said, “Are
                    you sure, I don't want to step on any toes”? He said, “He was a political
                    officer”. I said, “He is not a political officer, he has an office downtown.” It
                    turned out that he worked for the Library of Congress buying books. Everybody
                    had presumed he had been working for Langley for fifteen years, including, I am
                    sure, the Egyptians.</p>
                <p>So when it came time to cut back, the poor guy lost his job and was replaced by
                    an Egyptian. Anyway, the moral of the story, and I am digressing too much, is
                    what actually happened was that the agencies couldn't agree on a policy towards
                    Egypt. We could not and did not ever have a policy paper that could gain
                    acceptance in Washington. The summation of this was that it was agreed that
                    everybody would continue to go on doing their own thing. As before, you didn't
                    the rock the boat as long as these other agencies didn't get in your way. We did
                    manage to cut back in a few slots, purely because of budgetary reasons, but as
                    far as the whole idea of having a policy and directing your resources towards
                    it, that did not work.</p>

                <p>Political officer, Don Burgess, had always felt for a long time that there were
                    approximately 50 people in Egypt that it was important to know—these were
                    Nasser's inner circle. Under Nasser and indeed, I suppose, under Sadat, too, and
                    probably now, the Foreign Office, well maybe it has changed in 30 years, but the
                    Foreign Office in those days was composed of people who had still been educated
                    under Farouk or at least in the old line British tradition of a Foreign Office,
                    but the fact of the matter is that they had very little influence on foreign
                    policy.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DWYER: It did the necessary as far as the support of the Embassy was concern and
                    when we got into a brew-ha-ha about buying a new Embassy residence even there
                    they were of little or no help. We rented a Victorian manse in Heliopolis, a
                    suburb of Cairo, for the American Ambassador which was badly suited for Embassy
                    needs. It was enormous and had 4 or 5 bedrooms. It was in the middle of town, a
                    couple of blocks from Independence Square where the mobs could stop in on their
                    way to assemble or disassemble and had really nothing to recommend it.</p>
                <p>We had literally millions and millions of Egyptian pounds. Luc Battle found a
                    house on the other side of the river that was a lovely place and ran from the
                    river back to the main road going out to the pyramids—in other words, a whole
                    block that had been owned by one of the early prominent politicians of Egypt and
                    his wife, who was a French woman. She was now elderly and still living on the
                    property. She was quite agreeable to selling the property to the United States
                    after her death. We had a fairly sharp general services officer and admin
                    officer and I must say the poor old lady was probably not even cold before the
                    property was signed, sealed and delivered to the American government. This
                    absolutely outraged, I guess it was the Minister of Labor who had his eye on
                    this property. We ran the American flag up the flag pole, the militia came in
                    and tore it down and we ran it up again, etc.</p>
                <p>Finally, after Nasser's death, Sadat had decided he wanted it as his personal
                    residence and we agreed as you pretty well must with the president of a country
                    that we would give it to him for exchange of another property of equal value and
                    location—which, of course, we never got. In the interval the Egyptians
                    demolished the lovely Georgian type house that was on the property and Sadat
                    decided he didn't want to live there anyway as it was too close to the
                    university, so he gave us back the property but it no longer had the house. I
                    think we may have finally built on it, but it was a typical tarantula and the
                    frog crossing the river...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was before the major war, '67 war, but what was the
                        view of Israel and what we were doing there from our Embassy in Cairo at
                        that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>DWYER: I don't know whether I could say that the Embassy had a view in that
                    sense. Certainly the traditional career officers who were specialists in the
                    Arab world were attempting to fight what was even then recognized as a defensive
                    battle against giving too much away for free to the Israelis. As a matter of
                    fact that was one of the reasons, the question of Israeli politics, that Luc
                    Battle came out as Ambassador. He had previously been Assistant Secretary for
                    Cultural Affairs and therefore he was acceptable to both sides—the Israeli and
                    Arab.</p>
                <p>He almost didn't make it because we got the request for the agr�ment in the
                    middle of the night [these things come in under the Agr�ment Channel and my job
                    consisted of getting up in the middle of the night and going in to see all of
                    these highly classified things that Washington would send out in the middle of
                    the night because no ambassador or minister was going to take more than a month
                    of coming in in the middle of the night before they handed the job over to me.
                    Ninety-nine percent of it was, of course, absolutely useless and there was
                    nothing you could do anyway in the middle of the night.] I got the request at
                    3:00 in the morning and looked at it—we had been expecting something so I didn't
                    know whether to get Bill Boswell out of bed or not. So I compromised and called
                    him and told him we got the message we had been looking for. I said that there
                    was nothing we could do about it now. He said, “Well, I would kind of like to
                    know so, would you bring it over on your way home.” Which I did. We talked about
                    this new man Battle and looked him up in the Stud Book and discovered that
                    neither of us knew much about him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Stud Book I might add is the Biographic Register.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: I went home and he went to bed. At about 4:30 in the morning I got another
                    call and I go into the Embassy and a cable in the Agr�ment Channel says to take
                    no action on the first message. I sat there saying to myself, “Is there any way
                    that Boswell could mention this to someone—on his way in to work might he meet
                    the Foreign Minister or somebody—maybe I had better call.” So I called him and
                    said, “Bill, don't take any action on this, we got a telegram in.” He said,
                    “What does it say?” I said, “It just says to take no action on our previous
                    telegram.” He said, “Let's see it.” So I went by.</p>
                <p>To make it short, Senator Fulbright had decided that Luc Battle had been the only
                    decent Assistant Secretary of State for Cultural Affairs that had ever come
                    along and far superior to anyone likely to be there and he thought that was
                    important. He felt Luc Battle would foul up his career if he went out and got
                    involved between the Israelis and Arabs. According to Luc, he told me
                    afterwards, Fulbright was trying to do him a favor by holding up his
                    appointment—but he sure had us going around in the middle of the night.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Anyway, as far as Israeli policy was concerned, or Arab policy was concerned,
                    Battle, as I say, was chosen, at least in part, because of his independence from
                    both sides. Cairo, in those days before the recognition of Israel, was still
                    very much the leader of the Arab world. It had an enormous film industry. The
                    Egyptian dialect was almost a lingua franca in inter-Arab media and Egypt had a
                    powerful influence culturally and historically on the rest of the Arab world
                    which was one of the reasons why we had the extensive staff in USIA and the
                    Library of Congress and Agriculture and everybody else out there. So that was
                    important to us to influence, I suppose, to the extent we could. They burned the
                    library down around our ears one Thanksgiving morning so I don't know how much
                    influence our cultural activities had there, but certainly this was a point.</p>
                <p>The years have gone by too fast for me to remember what in the ''60s we were
                    specifically trying to achieve. I think one primary objective concerned
                    irrigation from the Jordan River, for example. While I was in Egypt, my wife and
                    I decided we had to take a look at Israel after this many years in the Arab
                    world so we went over and spent 2 � weeks there. I think we put something like
                    3000 miles on the car and Israel is not a very big country. I don't know many
                    roads that we missed. But we couldn't find the Jordan River. We were at the Sea
                    of Galilee, going all around it, did it twice. Finally I realized that this
                    little trickle going under a bridge that looked like something that went across
                    a golf course stream at home was the Jordan River. It was incredible that we had
                    been spending so much time on what amount of water we were going to allocate
                    between Jordan and Israel.</p>
                <p>Beyond that when you look back on it, of course, before the '67 war and before
                    the capture of Jerusalem, it was almost a high point in the Arab world in terms
                    of land and containment. Lots of which has since gone by the books. But
                    basically for those of the Embassy staff, if you could say that they were
                    subjected to the usual clientitis that affects Foreign Service Officers by which
                    I mean the tendency to support the country you are in, I think it was largely
                    and pretty solidly linked to trying to keep a more or less even posture. At
                    least up and till the famous “Let the Americans drink the waters of the Red Sea”
                    speech of Nasser in the summer of '66. That I would say was about the time that
                    things begin to go down hill. That and the fact that they had arrested one of
                    the American diplomats at the Embassy and held him for a day and then kicked him
                    out. Then we had the dumbest military attach� in God's green earth there who was
                    not allowed access to Limited Distribution telegrams...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is the lowest of classifications.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>DWYER: Well, he had managed to get himself arrested with one of his junior
                    officers, he was Air Force actually, in a station wagon. He had been on the
                    desert road from Cairo to Alexandria, which went right by a Egyptian military
                    base, and whatever he thought he was doing, I don't know, but he was out there
                    with a 600mm lens or something, up on a hill—why he thought he could do this
                    unobserved with his young captain, who knew better, I don't know. After
                    finishing with his snapshots they continued driving along the road because they
                    were supposedly en route to their summer house down in Alexandria. They found
                    the way blocked by an armored personnel carrier with a tank in front and in
                    back. It was a Saturday afternoon and I served in that case and several other
                    cases as the expendable Foreign Service officer. Nobody wanted to touch this
                    thing. The political section said, “They were stupid enough to get themselves
                    into position, let them get themselves out of it.” The Station people didn't
                    want to have anything to do with them. The rest of the military were not going
                    to do any good, so I was told to go down and see what I could do.</p>
                <p>I drove down and there they were in there car—they had locked the windows and
                    refused to get out. I met one of the most angry Egyptian Brigadiers that had
                    ever been my misfortune to encounter. Frankly I kind of sympathized with him,
                    because I think he was not so much angry with these guys taking pictures because
                    that is what military attach�s are supposed to do, but for being so damn stupid
                    and blatant. He said, “Now good, you are here from the Embassy you can witness
                    me rip that automobile apart and haul those guys out of there.” I said, “No,
                    wait a minute, you know it is Saturday afternoon and we haven't gotten a hold of
                    Washington yet (which was not quite true). Don't do anything that you will later
                    regret. You could be a colonel again before you knew it if you made a misstep
                    here. By all means check with Nasser's office out there and call so and so
                    because our Ambassador had been in touch with him. Just don't do anything for
                    awhile. These guys are not too bright, besides what could they have possibly
                    taken pictures of—we know what armored personnel carriers look like, and
                    everything else.” He finally decided to sit on it and we went back and the
                    Egyptian government said, “Well, kick them in the fanny and tell them not to do
                    it again.” It could have been a nasty thing. Still in the Arab world, if you do
                    not except, as one would in the Western world, the line from the official
                    spokesman, you can usually find a way to work around these things.</p>
                <p>Luc Battle was a tremendously even tempered person. I saw him angry only twice.
                    At this time he called the guy in and said, “You know, you have just come back
                    from a conference in Germany where you and I both were lectured on satellite and
                    U2 capabilities (the aircraft) of taking close-up pictures as if you were
                    standing inside a place. What a stupid thing for you go do.” That was when the
                    guy no longer had access to Limited Distribution telegrams.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>We had a problem with an Agricultural Attach�, but there too, the Egyptians
                    helped us. It was a corruption problem where he was smuggling money out of the
                    country. I was still in Syria when it happened but he was our Agricultural
                    Attach� for Syria too. I couldn't figure what he was doing coming through as
                    often as he was. It turned out he was smuggling Egyptian pounds for rich
                    Egyptians and selling them on the Lebanese pirate market. An Egyptian farmer
                    came to us at the Embassy and told us what he was doing so we got him out of
                    there. Bill Boswell, who had been head of security in the Department before he
                    came out, was just absolutely furious at this. It turned out that there was not
                    much we could do. The attach� lost his $15,000 a year job. We should have let
                    him sit there for another year in hopes that he would not declare it on his
                    income tax—but he did declare it so he walked away with it.</p>
                <p>But that was another case where the Egyptians accused an Embassy employee and
                    arrested him, an American diplomat, on the basis of bribing Egyptian officials.
                    All of this was worked out pretty well with the Egyptians.</p>

                <p>DWYER: Well, this was the deal I had made to stay on an extra year in Cairo when
                    Luc Battle asked me to stay on for a third year. I said, “You know I did this
                    once before and I really shouldn't do it. I am spending too long in these
                    countries. I will stay a third year but this time let's see what we can have
                    because I have been assigned to Aden as deputy principal officer thanks to the
                    fact that our political counselor in Damascus had been assigned as principal
                    officer in Aden and asked for me and to my absolute horror got me before I knew
                    what was going on.”</p>

                <p>DWYER: Well, this was Curt Jones and I liked Curt and I could have worked with
                    him happily, but we had three years in Damascus and that is a hard post,
                    particularly on a wife in those days and Cairo was a great deal better but still
                    if I had intended to make a career out of the Arab world I had better learn the
                    language better than I did in after hour classes.</p>

                <p>So Luc Battle swore on his oath as an ambassador that he would find something for
                    me if I stayed another year. I did and he was as good as his word and got me
                    what I think was one of the most fun jobs I've ever had as a junior officer. The
                    reason Scandinavian affairs was the ideal place for a junior officer to work on
                    a Desk was because the countries are not important enough for the Assistant
                    Secretaries to be their own Desk Officers. Also the Scandinavian diplomats are
                    terribly nice people and unlike the senior officials we send to their countries
                    they are all career and highly polished and knowledgeable almost without
                    fail—and the almost is a certain Swede—and terribly interesting and pleasant
                    people to work with. So I found myself first year as Finnish Desk Officer and
                    then for a year and a half or two years as Denmark, Norway and Iceland the NATO
                    country officer with an assistant. An extraordinary good time was had by all.
                    Because our ambassadors were well trained and house broken you could get them in
                    to see anybody they wanted very, very easily.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say your ambassadors you are talking about the
                        Scandinavian ambassadors to this country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Yes. I can remember the time the Norwegian Ambassador had his initial
                    courtesy call on Dean Rusk. They had been friends for a long time. The Norwegian
                    had been private secretary to the Norwegian Foreign Minister and as such had
                    been a young foreign service officer when Dean Rusk had been younger in the
                    Department. Precisely six minutes after this cordial meeting the Norwegian said,
                    “Thank you Mr. Secretary” and got up to leave. I think Rusk was surprised, I
                    certainly was surprised. Rusk said, “What's your hurry? Have you no more to
                    discuss?” And he said, “Mr. Secretary, I have always things to discuss with you,
                    but at no time will I ever take more than five minutes because I want to come
                    back.” Rusk, of course, was flattered and pleased and said, “Well, sit down.”
                    So, they talked for another twenty minutes.</p>
                <p>I got back to the office and looked over my notes which were all about growing
                    up, etc. and decided not to do a memcon because there was nothing there. A few
                    weeks later the Executive Secretary called and said, “Were is the memcon?” I
                    said, “They didn't say anything.” There was absolute silence on the other end of
                    the line. He said, “What do you mean they didn't say anything?” I said,
                    “Precisely that. They didn't say anything.” Anyway that was how I learned how
                    the Department works—that you had to have a memcon no matter what. I think I got
                    a couple of paragraphs out of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about our relations with Finland? Here is sort of an
                        odd country at that time—we are talking about 1966-67. How did you see our
                        interests in Finland?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>DWYER: On the whole they were excellent. They were excellent with all the
                    Scandinavian countries with the exception of Sweden because of the Vietnam
                    War—there was Olaf Palma marching down the streets of Stockholm with his arm
                    around the Viet Cong representative. I had Sweden for 6 months or so while
                    someone was on leave as well. That was a little different experience. Of course,
                    none of the other Scandinavians were very fond of Vietnam, but they were
                    forgiving and tolerant.</p>
                <p>Finland was a special case, obviously. It was the 50th anniversary of Finnish
                    independence while I was the Desk Officer there. I spent a lot of time on that.
                    We had a Finnish ambassador, Olavee Munki—I forget what he had been before but
                    he certainly wasn't a career diplomat—who was a little bit rough around the
                    edges. He was clever enough to use the Desk on a personal basis. I spent a lot
                    of time with his invitation lists and what to do about his parties, and could I
                    insure that the Secretary would show up for something, which fortunately for
                    Scandinavia I could. We were interested in Finland as being a close neighbor of
                    the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>The Finns have an excellent reputation in the United States as the only country
                    that paid its First World War debts and when the 50th anniversary came along
                    Tyler Thompson, our ambassador in Helsinki, said we really have to do something
                    special for the Finns on their 50th anniversary. I went down to Jimmy Symington,
                    who was our then Chief of Protocol, and was informed that we had something like
                    $250 with which to make this big impression on the Finns. The Ambassador had in
                    mind endowing a Chair in American History at the University of Helsinki, which
                    we figured was in the neighborhood of $300-$500,000—and I had $250! Jimmy
                    Symington wanted to give them a tree. I said, “A tree to Finland?” He said,
                    “Certainly, not just any tree but a tree from Mt. Vernon, that is something
                    special.” I said, “There isn't a tree that is special—maybe a redwood if you
                    could get one.”</p>
                <p>At one point we were thinking of a bison because you could get them free—if you
                    are interested I think you still can from the Department of the Interior which
                    will be glad to deliver one to a railroad head if you take charge of it from
                    there. I was thinking of giving a bison to the Helsinki zoo. I called up our
                    ambassador there and he said, “Have you ever smelled a bison? Not while I'm
                    ambassador.”</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>Anyway, my predecessor had had a brilliant idea and we went down to see
                    Congressman Blachit who had the greatest number of Finns in his constituency of
                    any congressman in the United States. He was Chairman of the Civil Service and
                    Post Office Committee. He was from that region of Minnesota directly north—I'm
                    including Duluth—the mine area where all the Finns are. We went down to see his
                    Administrative Assistant, who has since succeeded him as Congressman, Jim
                    Oberstar. Jim liked what we suggested which was to issue a stamp in
                    commemoration of the 50th anniversary of Finnish independence. This is very
                    rarely done—that there is a stamp issued in honor of any individual country—but
                    anybody who knows about the Finns likes them and they really had nobody, except
                    perhaps the Teetotalers Association or somebody like that who might find fault
                    with the Finns. So he said, “I will bring it up with the Congressman.” Which he
                    did. He said, “I will tell you what, if you get the stamp what ceremonies are
                    you going to have?” I said, “Well, the United Nations General Assembly begins in
                    September and we thought we would invite the Foreign Minister down to Delaware
                    which is not very far because that was where the first Finns and Swedes in
                    colonial times settled in the United States. We would issue the stamp there.”
                    Jim said, “That is not good enough. If you can get him out for a couple of days
                    in the Congressman's district, at one of the post offices—there is a post office
                    Finland, Minnesota—I think I can get you a stamp.” I went to Munki and he said
                    that there was no way he was going to get his Foreign Minister, who subsequently
                    became Prime Minister, up to Minnesota. He said, “Unless you said you could
                    possibly give him a few days of fishing. The Foreign Minister is an avid
                    fisherman and that's pretty good fishing up there.” I went back to Jim Oberstar
                    and asked if that would be possible. Jim said, “Nothing easier.” He got a hold
                    of some Finns in his congressman's constituency up there who were absolutely
                    delighted and they set up a program of three days of fishing up in the boundary
                    lakes on the Canadian border.</p>
                <p>I called Olavee Munki and said, “All right, we got the fishing.” Then Olavee
                    said, “How is he going to get there?” I said, “Well I was kind of hoping he was
                    going to buy a ticket.” Munki said, “Let me see what my commercial officer can
                    do.” As it turned out the head of the Coast Guard was an American of Finnish
                    descent who had a Lear jet. He had always wanted to buy a couple of Finnish
                    icebreakers and the Finns had wanted to sell them, but they had never surmounted
                    the congressional problems about buying foreign icebreakers. But he said he
                    would be delighted to find some business that would take him out to Minnesota at
                    the required time if the Foreign Minister could get back on his own. So that was
                    how we left it.</p>
                <p>The Foreign Minister came and I met him in Minnesota, because I talked myself in
                    to going. The State Department couldn't care less, I had a terrible time getting
                    them to even pay my way out to Minnesota as someone to watch over it. I went out
                    there with a guy named Rosenburg.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>Anyway, there was Rosenburg and Dwyer and more Finns than you could shake a stick
                    at. We all got up to this lodge that one of these Finns owned. They were all
                    great outdoorsmen, as all Finns are, and we had houseboats, canoes and just
                    every facility for fishing that you could think of. About 30 minutes after we
                    got to the lodge the conversation began in Finnish and didn't stop for three
                    days. So except for Rosenburg and Dwyer, we shared a room, we were on the
                    outskirts. Our only problem was that the Foreign Minister never caught a fish.
                    Finally the guide said, “Listen, let me take him in a small boat, I know where
                    he can get a fish.” So I went out with the rest of the Finnish Embassy and we
                    fished—we were going for steelheads and pike. I finally asked someone where was
                    he taking the Foreign Minister—a question I should have asked before he left. He
                    said, “Well, we are kind of fished out around here but he has gone over to the
                    Canadian side. I am sure he can get fish there.” All I could think of was the
                    Finnish Foreign Minister getting caught by a game warden on the Canadian side.
                    But he fortunately showed up.</p>
                <p>In the mean while all the Finns in my boat were gloriously drunk and the press
                    officer sat in the bait bucket and we had to pull all the hooks out of his rear
                    end and he didn't even feel it, fortunately. We had a bang up colossal dinner
                    that night as we were all going back. The same press officer proceeded to go out
                    to a bar that was frequented by the Swedes and Norwegians—the Swedes were at one
                    end and the Norwegians were at the other and there was no place for a Finn
                    because he got beat up on both sides. He was delivered back by the local
                    police—he was in very poor shape which got him in Dutch with his ambassador.
                    But, outside of that, it was a wonderful trip.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would like to move on from this period. You then got
                        yourself back overseas. You served in Sofia from 1970-72. How did that
                        assignment come about and what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Well, the assignment came about because although I had very much enjoyed
                    my work with the Scandinavians—it was great—I had always had a longing to go to
                    Eastern Europe and I had applied for and was accepted for the Serbo-Croatian
                    language training where I was to be the second man in the political section
                    there. I had my assignment cut short, which was very nicely done by my immediate
                    superior, and got through approximately eight weeks of Serbo-Croatian language
                    training only to discover that the guy who I was to succeed changed his mind and
                    had requested that he be extended for another year. This left me high and dry
                    without a job.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>We had just adopted a child and I didn't want to accept an immediate overseas
                    assignment because I had to be in the District of Columbia six months for the
                    adoption to be final. Obviously my wife and I did not want anything to go wrong
                    with that and I was, therefore, unwilling to take a chance with something going
                    wrong with the adoption process which would cease if we went overseas and we
                    would have to do it again when we came back. I was offered Bulgaria—was harassed
                    with Bulgaria, but a Foreign Service classmate of mine, Don Tice, who had served
                    in Bulgaria said this is not something that you really want to do, and I didn't
                    want to do it. But after eight weeks of Serbo-Croatian and no other job—I could
                    have gone on and finished Serbo-Croatian but there was no job prospect in sight
                    and seemed like a waste—so I said all right we will reluctantly go to Bulgaria.
                    I in some ways still regret it, but I then switched over to Bulgarian language
                    training which was kind of a disaster because I sounded like a Macedonian,
                    rather than a Bulgar...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I took Serbo-Croatian and found I could talk to Bulgarians
                        very slowly and they could talk to me very slowly and we could get along
                        fine, but obviously they are two different languages.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: They are indeed two different languages.</p>
                <p>We got there in early summer or spring of 1970. It was a really remarkably dull
                    country in terms of what was going on. The Soviet Ambassador was referred to as
                    the pro-consul which indeed he was. It had many of the disadvantages of Moscow
                    without the advantage of knowing you are in a major country—major player.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No Bolshoi Theater or anything like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Well, a pretty decent opera. Boris Christoff would come back and do a good
                    Mose once or twice, but then there would be only one or two tickets for the
                    Embassy and that was it and you never saw him anyway.</p>
                <p>There were many of the same problems as in Moscow. There were the secret police,
                    the constant surveillance and living in the golden ghetto—which certainly was a
                    ghetto, but not all that golden. It was terribly difficult on the spouses, on my
                    wife, because at least we could go to the office and have our work to do and its
                    a characteristic of the Foreign Service Officer that he can be in a country for
                    a few weeks and he can convince himself that it is really important, whether it
                    is or not, but at least give a little seasoning to the work. Whereas the wives
                    were pretty much confined to other diplomat corps wives. It was not a very
                    exciting place.</p>
                <p>I had a little experiment of bringing in vegetables from Yugoslavia because in
                    the winter we got no fresh vegetables whatsoever and we pretty soon got tired of
                    cabbage and pickled cabbage.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And turnip salad?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We had a lot of turnip salad.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: A number of us arranged with one of these transfer firms to bring in some
                    fresh fruits and vegetables around the Christmas season. Of course, they just
                    disappeared and two weeks after they had arrived and were, of course, spoiled,
                    Customs called up and said, “Oh, by the way we forgot to tell you that you have
                    a shipment down there.” We didn't try that again.</p>
                <p>A lot of people depended on the Commissary in Athens. We would send a truck down
                    occasionally, but I didn't like that to begin with. A few of us, and I found
                    this quite helpful, hunted quite a bit—wild pheasant, quail and grouse. This
                    kept meat on the table because the only thing you could buy in meat generally in
                    the winter time was a fairly decent tenderloin, but there is only so many
                    tenderloins you can eat and frozen chickens. That was about it—and, of course,
                    we did better than the Bulgarians did. But the Bulgarians had what we didn't
                    have—there was no Bulgarian alive who didn't relatives back in the village and
                    on the farm.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any major policy problems? You say it was a
                        pretty dull time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: No. Absolutely none that I can think of in terms of policies. I was
                    political/economic officer with an assistant and a secretary. The Embassy was
                    limited by the Bulgarian government to, I think it was 21 people which included
                    8 marines. The economic job in many ways was a better job than any other because
                    there were things that the Bulgarians wanted to buy and certainly things
                    Americans wanted to sell, or at least some Americans firms. That gave me access
                    to a certain level of Bulgarian officialdom—the Chamber of Commerce, the
                    Department of Agriculture, and the Ministry of Foreign Trade.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>As far as policies were concerned there, our policy towards Bulgaria was whatever
                    was left over after our policy towards the Soviet Union. There was not much
                    distinction made between the two, and I suppose rightly so. We were interested
                    in specifically any Bulgarian interest in the Middle East, and of course
                    Bulgaria was sitting on the flank of two NATO countries, Greece and Turkey.
                    There is nothing that the Greeks and Turks don't know about the Bulgarians and
                    vice versa. Nobody is going to watch a Bulgarian more closely than a Turk. There
                    was a large Turkish embassy and a couple of consulate generals there. The Greeks
                    were going through several governments at the time, Colonels and what have you,
                    it was pretty quiet there. The Bulgarians were smart enough not to tempt the
                    Yugoslavs too greatly—any claims to Macedonia or things like that. They were
                    aware of the problems of the territory that was still contested between the two
                    countries and while they made the proper noises that it was still greater
                    Bulgaria they weren't going to tempt Tito to have a little show of force or
                    something and the Soviets probably wouldn't have permitted it anyway.</p>
                <p>The Soviets had military facilities there but no troops stationed there. We were
                    interested in those. I had my best weekend of my tour in Bulgaria when I was out
                    looking for Warsaw Pact maneuvers over in the Balkan mountains, which are inland
                    from and run parallel to the Danube River. We had heard that there were
                    maneuvers out there so we thought we would go and see if we could find them. The
                    map showed a secondary road going over the Balkans, and I, by that time, had
                    driven over most of Bulgaria and said “let's try it” to my wife. Near the top of
                    this road I broke the oil pan and there we were with my American car equipped
                    with power steering, power brakes, etc. and no engine—there was nothing around,
                    the road was just a dirt track. I turned off the motor because I had lost all
                    the oil and coasted down the other side of the mountain and in to the little
                    village of Stara Lycar. The head of the state farm came out and the first thing
                    he asked me was did I know that I was the first wheeled vehicle that had come
                    over that route since the Second World War. It was the Soviet jeeps and tanks
                    that had come over. Anyway there we were.</p>
                <p>The village was the headquarters of the state farm, the forestry farm, and the
                    people, as was true in the villages almost anywhere, could not have been nicer.
                    My major concern, as was everyone's concern in the Embassy, was not to get
                    people in trouble with the secret police, etc. so there was a two room hotel
                    over the general store where we got a room. Then we tried to call the Embassy—we
                    had an Embassy truck, but it had gone to Athens to fill up with commissary goods
                    and wasn't going to be back for a day or two. So we had dinner at a little cafe
                    that was part of the general store. Before we knew it we had as company the
                    deputy director of the state farm who was the acting director of it, and a guy
                    from the commissariat to the mayor's office, and a third guy. The slivovitz was
                    beginning to be passed with great regularity and it looked like a long evening.
                    I said that I hoped everyone understand that I was a diplomat from the American
                    Embassy and, although, delighted to have their company wanted to be certain they
                    understood who I was. The third guy, who I wasn't sure of, said, “Don't worry, I
                    am the secret police guy, we have checked you out and it is okay.” My wife saw
                    the male bonding going on and went off to bed.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>We sat there a while with a second bottle of slivovitz. Finally the guy from the
                    state farm said, “Listen I think we can fix this guy's car.” There was only one
                    car in the village which belonged to the director of the state farm and he
                    wasn't there, so there weren't any cars in the village at that time. They had
                    trucks, but no cars. We left the cafe singing Bulgarian songs, some of them I
                    didn't know I knew. Somebody came along with a truck from the state farm and we
                    tied my car on behind it and tooled off down the road about midnight or one in
                    the morning to the machine tractor station. There was a veteran sitting guarding
                    the gates with his little fire. We all pounded on the gates and said let us in.
                    He said I can't let you. They prevailed on him and finally he agreed to let us
                    in if we had a couple of drinks with him. So we opened up the gates and pushed
                    the car up on the concrete oil changing ramps, used for changing the oil of
                    tractors, that fortunately fit. We proceeded to drink some more and then went
                    back to the hotel. By this time I am surprised I found it—wouldn't have without
                    the help of the Bulgarians.</p>
                <p>I went to bed and got up in the morning with the most horrible slivovitz hangover
                    that I ever had, with the big notion that I had pushed my car up on a piece of
                    concrete somewhere but wasn't quite sure. I went down and there were all my
                    buddies waiting for me at breakfast as chipper as could be. We got into the
                    truck and went out there. The whole state farm stopped work because here was a
                    modern American car with all the fancy goodies Americans have in their cars. It
                    was a Mercury with the old 6 � Liter Ford V-8 engine which I had gotten by
                    mistake. When we took the oil pan out, the whole oil pump dropped out. I
                    thought, Oh, god, we will never get it back up. The blacksmith beat out the oil
                    pan and welded it. The apprentice cut a new gasket from cork and then we put it
                    back on only to discover that we didn't have any oil. There were only trucks and
                    tractors in the village. Somebody came up with two cans of oil that were
                    reserved for the director's automobile and we poured them in there and then we
                    filled it up with tractor oil. We drove back to the village, about a mile and a
                    half away, with everybody in the back seat—must have been eight of us in the
                    car.</p>
                <p>Nobody allowed us to pay for anything—hotel room, food, nothing. I said to the
                    deputy director let me at least buy a few bottles of slivovitz, but they
                    wouldn't hear of it. Finally the guy from the tractor station said you know what
                    you could do, we would love to drive your car. We spent the whole afternoon
                    driving that car up and down this dirt road and I think everyone in the village
                    who knew how to drive and two or three who didn't, drove the car. We left as
                    very good friends.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>A year later, the guy from the machine tractor station walked into the Embassy in
                    Sofia—we had militia outside who normally would not let Bulgarians in unless
                    they had business and could prove that they had business. There was this great
                    commotion outside the door and somebody went out and here was my friend who told
                    the militia where to get off and proceeded to walk in and said he wanted to see
                    his friend Dwyer, which sent all the spooks right up the wall. I came down to
                    see him and said, “Stanov you just walked in here?” He said, “Sure why not? I
                    just tell the militia off.” So, I called my wife Sally at home and said, “Sally,
                    Stanov is here.” We really wanted to do something for him, but we didn't want to
                    have him over to the apartment because it is in a secured building and we knew
                    we were bugged, etc. He was a bit of a rustic and we didn't want to take him to
                    a fancy hotel. So we ended up at what was called the Makana, a very nice place
                    like a Greek taverna.</p>
                <p>Stanov was his expansive self. We get down there and the waiter comes up and says
                    would you like a slivovitz, and I thought of my Finnish friends who would say at
                    that point, “goodbye clear day” and said, “Well, maybe just one.” Stanov said no
                    way and brings out of his beat up briefcase his homemade slivovitz. The waiter
                    said, “You can't serve that in here.” Stanov said, “I wouldn't drink your crap
                    that you call slivovitz.” I said, to the waiter, “Okay, bring the slivovitz.”
                    Stanov poured it onto the floor and we drank his!</p>
                <p>Outside of that, policy matters of Bulgarian foreign policy we had almost
                    nothing. There was a little on the Vietnam thing. We had the Viet Cong
                    represented in Bulgaria to say nothing of the Hanoi government, North
                    Koreans—all the people we didn't like. The Mongolian, who shot the head off the
                    Chief of Protocol at the diplomatic hunt and a few others like that. It wasn't
                    bad. We had a mountain cabin in the village where we could get away, but outside
                    of that it was pretty deadly dull.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would move on, if you don't mind. I thought I would skip
                        an assignment that you had in Cultural Affairs because I would like to
                        concentrate on two other ones that you had. We may continue this another
                        time, if you don't mind, and see how things go. You were in Cultural Affairs
                        from 1972-74. In summary what were your concerns and what were you
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>DWYER: That turned out to be quite a great job. A friend of mine was the office
                    director of it and looking over possible assignments from Bulgaria there was
                    nothing that appealed to me very much. The idea of doing something Eastern
                    Europe seemed better than wandering off to a functional area. I ended up there,
                    eventually as de facto deputy and principally responsible for several countries,
                    but also the overall budget and financing of our programs. The programs
                    consisted of the Fulbright program and a few other exchange programs. My
                    principal concerns were Eastern Europe and we had other people working on the
                    Soviet Union. We had a wonderful resource there that nobody in the Department
                    seemed to know about or care about and that we had an almost limitless budget,
                    literally millions of dollars in Polish zlotys. We could spend them not only in
                    Poland but in Yugoslavia, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Hungary and Czechoslovakia
                    were still a little dicey in those days. We had a hard time doing things. We did
                    a little bit in Budapest, Hungary, but a very little bit in Prague. A fair
                    amount of things in Romania—anything that would irritate the Russians, I guess.
                    Of course, quite a bit in Yugoslavia, including starting a prototype of an
                    American land-grant university.</p>
                <p>My particular bailiwick was Poland, principally because of the zlotys. I found
                    that the Poles, just like the Syrians, were good entrepreneurs. There was a
                    budget of a couple of million dollars to run the Fulbright program. If we could
                    agree with the Poles on a way to save money, we could expand the program. I
                    think about that time the Polish Airlines got approval to land in the States.
                    There was a guy at the University of Poznan, Mickel something, who was a real
                    wheeler-dealer, and he and I late at night at some Poznan cafe got the brilliant
                    idea that if he could, he had a big English language program there, get the
                    Ministry to agree to funding the airline fares of all our Fulbright people, I
                    would agree to spend the dollars that we were using on the fares to bring more
                    Poles to the States—split our profits 50-50. In a short matter we increased the
                    program by about 50 to 75 percent. He went with me the next day to see the
                    Minister who said it was a great idea—I spoke with the Minister in French and
                    then had to translate into Polish for Mike—and agreement was reached in about
                    ten minutes.</p>
                <p>The wonderful thing about this office of Cultural Affairs was—I had just
                    committed the US government to expanding the program by half its size and nobody
                    cared, I could do it. I knew that my immediate superior, the Officer Director,
                    would think it was great. Once I got the taste of what money was like, which I
                    had never had before, we expanded the English language program in Poland so that
                    it became, next to Russian which was compulsory, the second most common language
                    not only in the universities but the high schools. We established the Chair of
                    American studies at the University of Warsaw in conjunction with the University
                    of Illinois.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>We did a pilot study with the Senior Scientific Council—a computer program which
                    was a management program from New York University. It was a simulated program
                    that NYU used for their MBAs—actually operating a business with participation of
                    volunteer bankers, volunteer tax people, people actually from Chase Manhattan
                    Bank or from the IRS, etc. So we spent quite a bit of money although we didn't
                    make a real dent in the zlotys in adopting this to Poland for their commercial
                    departments. It was a great thing because by the time we had this very large
                    computer simulation done, it not only taught the Poles about how its own
                    government worked, but you can imagine what a tool it was for our businessmen.
                    They could play the game here and learn how to do business in Poland. So it
                    turned out to be a much better job than I thought, because I had millions of
                    dollars and nobody gave a damn what we did with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then I would like to move on. I thought we might
                        finish off Chad and maybe then set this up for another time.</hi>

                <p>DWYER: Sure. Okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get your next assignment? You went to Chad
                        from 1974-77.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Well, my Office Director said, Please stay on and we will confirm you as
                    my deputy in Cultural Affairs.” I said that I had stayed on too long. I went
                    down to see a friend of mine, a classmate, in personnel assignments and said,
                    “John, whatever you have.” He said he had three small posts in Africa all of
                    which need DCMs. They were in countries that I—well I suppose I had heard of
                    them, but didn't know much about. The crucial factor was that the ambassador in
                    Chad was leaving momentarily and there was no one on the horizon at any time
                    soon so I could go out with the assurance that I would be Charg� for a
                    considerable period of time. That was why I went to Chad. I wanted a chance to
                    run my own show for a while. Again it is one of these things that “you can have
                    the post if you skip the DCM training course and get there yesterday,
                    because...”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: I was going to say McClintock, but I think it was McCormick. After that he
                    was ambassador in Morocco. It was a good Irish name, and I can't think of it.
                    [Edward W. Mulcahy] I never saw him. The only thing I did was buy his car—which
                    was a mistake.</p>
                <p>Anyway, we arrived and I had a three-day overlap with my predecessor, the DCM,
                    and found myself with this little Embassy in the middle of Africa. Fortunately,
                    my French, although rusty, came back pretty fast. My limited Arabic didn't hurt
                    as Arabic was really the lingua franca.</p>

                        talking about 1974-77.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: The President of Chad, Tombalbaye, was one of the last, if not the last,
                    remaining civilian presidents of those west African countries that had become
                    independent in 1960. All the other countries had had their military coup d'etats
                    and the military or somebody else had taken over. Tombalbaye had managed to
                    survive principally by splitting up the opposition into several groups. For
                    example, we not only had a Chadian army, we had a frontier force, or militia, a
                    gendarmerie and a presidential guard, each of which was a counter balance to the
                    others.</p>
                <p>Secondly we had the French army. Chad sits in the middle of the African continent
                    and had the largest airport in the area. It is the airport where most
                    north/south African traffic stops. So we had one or two regiments of the Foreign
                    Legion there and at least one other regiment, and we had an on-going civil war
                    that went in fits and spurts and had been since shortly after independence.</p>
                <p>Chad, like the Sudan, is one of the African countries that is Arab in the north
                    and black in the south. The belt that became famous because of the drought in
                    those years, the Sahel, basically is that belt that goes across Africa where to
                    go north, the crops need irrigation and to go south they do not. Of course it
                    was the movement of that drought belt south that brought the horrendous famine
                    as it has done before. The black population became the governing population upon
                    independence, offsetting centuries of de facto if not actual Arab rule. The
                    Arabs of the north had always considered the blacks as inferior citizens from
                    the time of slavery—and I wouldn't be a bit surprised if there were still some
                    black slaves somewhere up near the Libyan/Chadian border.</p>
                <p>Although the French alleged in 1923 that the country was pacified, it never
                    really was. From the Mediterranean straight south to Chad, are traditional
                    caravan routes that are still used by trucks and landrovers, which go right
                    through civil wars and everything else, so you would find in the bazaars of the
                    capital, N'Djamena, dates from the north and carpets from Turkey, etc. at most
                    times during the civil war. Tombalbaye had appointed black governors to the
                    north region and from a time when the Arabs could consider themselves first rate
                    citizens they in some respects became second class. This area of northern Chad
                    had never been pacified. You went up there at your own risk.</p>
                <p>As a matter of fact when we arrived in Chad there was the Cloust affair. Madame
                    Cloust who was a French wife of an archeologist, I guess she was an archeologist
                    herself, he and a couple of West Germans were being held hostage by Hissen Habre
                    and the rebels in the north. The German government simply flew an airplane in
                    and brought their countrymen back. Of course, the Chadians immediately broke
                    relations with Germany which the Germans didn't particularly care.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>But this the French couldn't do because this was their client state. In effect
                    the French were paying for the government of Chad. The only money crop to speak
                    of was cotton through which most of their foreign exchange came from, but most
                    of it was subsidized by the French government. At the same time we had Conoco,
                    an American oil company, looking for petroleum, which they actually found up in
                    the desert and in several places, and this had the prospect of making the
                    Chadians possibly independent in terms of foreign exchange at least. The
                    American government had very little interest other than the fact that it was an
                    American company.</p>
                <p>There was a small AID program there. We were putting in about $10-15 million a
                    year. The program really wasn't formally established until after I got there. We
                    also had 50 or 60 Peace Corps volunteers—an excellent program. Superb young
                    people and some not so young. I still rankle when I think of these kids out in
                    the boonies where there was no way we could get them back if they got sick and
                    really wanted to come back. When Nixon commented about the Peace Corps being a
                    draft dodger's paradise, or something, I often wished he could have seen these
                    kids up there, because I thought the world of them. Strangely enough the harder
                    task you assigned them the better they did at it. Sometimes the ones in the city
                    got into trouble, but the ones out by themselves did a superb job. We ended up
                    doubling the program until I finally had to cancel it.</p>
                <p>The Chadian government wanted from us basically what every government in Africa
                    wants, and that is some money, please. After the overthrow of Tombalbaye, which
                    was a military coup d'etat despite the fact that he had gotten the forces
                    divided... He was overthrown and I will never forget it because I had sat there
                    on a Friday in this largely modest little country. However, the situation was
                    tense. I talked to our military attach� and our station people and our political
                    people—is this guy going to last or not? We weighed the pros and cons—he had
                    just jailed the top militia, gendarmerie officers and top army officers. I sat
                    down and said you know maybe I should just say nothing but that is not what I am
                    paid to do out here. Maybe there is somebody who is interested back there. I
                    wrote a long analytical piece that said that in effect I think he is good for
                    another 3 to 6 months. I gave it to the communications clerk, and of course we
                    were still dependent on telex there we didn't have radio communications. Went
                    home. About 3 o'clock Saturday morning the firing begins and I said to my wife,
                    “God damn it to hell.”</p>
                <p>My house was between the army camp and the President's lot. I went out and stood
                    on the road and the troops were going by, and the shooting, etc. Boy, was I
                    ticked off. There was a French intelligence colonel across the street from me.
                    He walked over and I said, “Are you doing this?” He said, “If we are, I don't
                    know about it.” I think the answer was that he may have known about it but he
                    wasn't doing it. At about that time the commanding general of the Chadian Army
                    pulls up and he says, ignoring me, to this French intelligence colonel, “Which
                    way do I jump?” The colonel says, “I don't know, but jump one way or another.”
                    So fortunately, the general jumped the right way. Tombalbaye was overthrown, he
                    was killed in his bungalow and his body was taken up in one of the old Chadian
                    Air Force DC-3's and jettisoned somewhere out over the desert so that it could
                    not be a form of pilgrimage.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he particularly hated or just in the way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Well, in effect in these countries, and what I say so often to my friends
                    who don't know some of these small countries, that there is not a true
                    government in the sense that there is in the western countries. The villages
                    were neither oppressed nor very much helped so you are talking about the
                    government establishment as a couple of big towns. But Tombalbaye became, or was
                    when I got there, an alcoholic—but half the government was and so was half the
                    next government—but he became increasingly incapable of governing the country.
                    He became increasingly paranoid. He was out in this isolated place waiting for
                    them to come and as the more isolated he became the less well he could even
                    attempt to govern the country. He suggested to the ambassador before I got
                    there, that why didn't the United States take over this country, just call him
                    president and the United States could do whatever we want. The telegram was
                    called, “Chad On A Silver Platter”, which we didn't want.</p>
                <p>As the civil war began to heat up a little bit and the rebels began advancing
                    towards the south I became concerned about two Peace Corps volunteers we had up
                    in Faya Largeau, which was up in the central part of the country—in the Arab
                    part, original Beau Geste country. The military in their wisdom had decided to
                    give our DC-3 to the Ethiopians, before the Ethiopian revolution, of course, and
                    had promised to replace it with a Lockheed King Air. But the Lockheed mechanic
                    took one look at the country and said no way he was going to be their and the
                    Air Force wasn't going to assign an airplane without a mechanic there so we lost
                    our airplane which meant that I lost the ability to get these people, which I
                    could only do in the dry season anyway. When it became time, I thought, to get
                    them out—the French had withdrawn their teachers, it looked like the government
                    was going to lose at any time the rebels made a push—I sent them word through
                    the Foreign Ministry that they were going to come out. About one o'clock that
                    morning the Foreign Minister called me up and said, “Mr. Dwyer I am speaking on
                    direct orders of President Tombalbaye.” I could hear the music blasting in the
                    background and the glasses clinking and it was obviously a great party. He said,
                    “I am formally instructed to inform you that if you pull those two Peace Corps
                    volunteers out of Faya Largeau, the President will expel the whole Peace Corps
                    and maybe your aide with it.” I said to the Foreign Minister, “Fine. We will
                    talk about it in the morning. I will see you tomorrow and let you know then.”
                    There was no way I was going to let these people stay there. I didn't even
                    bother to ask Washington. That would have just held things up for days. I went
                    down the next morning and I said to the Foreign Minister, “Mr. Foreign Minister,
                    thank you for your call. I have informed Washington that it is the decision of
                    the Chadian government that they would be very unhappy were we to withdraw our
                    Peace Corps volunteers from Faya Largeau. But despite this, which we can
                    understand, and we mean no reflection on your government, but we have no
                    airplane of our own anymore, etc., etc. why we have decided to go ahead and do
                    this.” The Foreign Minister said, “Well that wasn't what the President told me
                    last night.” I said, “My French isn't quite up to snuff Mr. Foreign Minister, I
                    guess I misunderstood you.” He said, “Well, maybe you didn't.”</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>But then we wondered how we would get them out. They are a couple of hundred of
                    miles up in the desert. Fortunately, that year was the Soviet's year to deliver
                    drought aid up there and the Soviets had a couple of Soviet transports. By
                    coincidence, the Soviet Ambassador was a great friend and he, unfortunately had
                    the habit of giving me a great big kiss every time he saw me—he had been the
                    economic counselor of the Soviet Embassy in Sofia. He was terribly bored in
                    Chad—he had almost nothing to do. He was a pretty nice guy. I said, “Vladimir,
                    old buddy, would you go and shanghai my Peace Corps volunteers and bring them
                    back?” He said, “Certainly, would be happy to do so.” And he did so. The next
                    flight to Faya Largeau the Soviets picked up the Peace Corps
                    volunteer—fortunately one was in town so there was only one up there—and brought
                    him back kicking and screaming. He said, “They wouldn't have hurt me, I have
                    members of Habre's family in my English class. They wouldn't have captured me.”
                    I said, “Listen, they have a whole bunch of people up north who said the same
                    thing. I have been around these parts of the world long enough. You may think
                    you are half Chadian, but you are not half Chadian to me and not half Chadian to
                    the Chadians. I am delighted to talk to you and get a briefing on what is going
                    on in Faya Largeau but I want you out of there and you are not going back.”
                    Where upon the kid went out and wrote a letter back to someone in the United
                    States that said that son of a bitch in the Embassy has been a real pain in the
                    ass. He is just like all the other State Department people, but he will get
                    around him because he knew Habre and I knew... Well, of course, what the kid
                    doesn't realize is that all his mail is being read.</p>
                <p>I liked the Chadians, but I never quite forgave them. Our Ambassador's wife was
                    not well and had been taken back to the United States. The Ambassador had
                    decided that he had to follow. He left and I was again Charg�—he had just gone
                    the week before when the kid wrote this particular letter including me and the
                    public affairs officer, who had a high profile, too. The Ambassador gets on the
                    plane having been decorated by the new military regime with the order of the
                    Golden Camel, or something, and two days later the Foreign Minister calls me in
                    and says, “Dick, this has nothing to do with you personally, but we are PNGing
                    your public affairs officer, your station chief and the brat who was in the
                    Peace Corps.”</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>Of course I knew nothing about the letter. I had no idea what had happened. I
                    called these three people into my office, individually, and said what did you
                    do? Nobody could account for it. I knew the public affairs officer, a big fellow
                    about 6 feet 3 inches who wore cowboy boots adding another couple of inches with
                    a red beard, spoke good French and learning Arabic, knew everybody in town and
                    in short, made the new government very nervous. In addition to which he had
                    gotten into a fight with the Minister of Education, because the Minister of
                    Education's wife who had been a long time employee of the USIA library was
                    grilled by the policy after there had been a theft. So I could understand why
                    they would get rid of him. They were getting rid of the station chief because he
                    was declared, by declared I mean he was identified to the government of Chad as
                    an employee of the Central Intelligence Agency, and was there with their
                    permission and consent, but we had had the coup d'etat and the government change
                    and it looked like a good time to get rid of him. And the Peace Corps volunteer,
                    I didn't know what happened to him, although I could guess. After a while I
                    finally got a copy of the letter. The only thing that was confusing about it was
                    that the Peace Corps volunteer identified me as the CIA chief.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to this new government? This was not the
                        Habre government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: No, basically what happened to the new government is that it lost the war.
                    The government was composed of military officers, Felix Malloum, who had been in
                    jail and had been a general, became the president. The Foreign Minister had been
                    a Lieutenant Colonel in the Guard, but all of them had been in the French Army
                    at one point or another. Most had served in Algeria and a few in Vietnam. They
                    were basically military men who simply could tolerate this highly corrupt and
                    incompetent government no longer as is often the case only to find running the
                    government is much more difficult than anyone had imagined. For the most part
                    they were decent people.</p>
                <p>I will never forget the independence days, which I lived in dread of after the
                    military took over. I had heard rumors about the first one to the effect that
                    the whole cabinet was going to jump out of an airplane and land in the stadium
                    for the independence day parade. I laughed at it, but when independence day
                    came, the whole cabinet jumped out of this airplane and did a pretty good job of
                    it too. They were all paratroopers.On the second independence day—by then things
                    were getting to be a little dicey. My daughter was home from school, from prep
                    school abroad, and so she and my wife had decided to take advantage of the long
                    weekend and take a look at the animals in the game part in the Cameroon. I was,
                    therefore, a bachelor there. The independence day parade reviewing stand
                    there...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were Charg� most of the time you were there weren't
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>DWYER: Yes. For about—I forget—Ed Little was the first ambassador there, it was
                    he whose wife was sick and never should have been there as Africa was just too
                    much for her to adjust to in her ''70s. Ed Little had never served in Africa, or
                    anywhere like it. He had been DCM in Switzerland and had never been to any place
                    quite like Chad. Mrs. Little spoke no French at all and the Ambassador's wasn't
                    very good.</p>
                <p>I was in the unfortunate position, as DCMs often are, of having been there for a
                    while and knowing everyone... I don't know if I ever told anyone this before but
                    after the Ambassador decided he had been in Chad long enough and understood the
                    problems he would go down to see the Foreign Minister by himself and come back
                    and start to write the telegram. The Foreign Minister would call me up and tell
                    me that he didn't think the Ambassador understood what he had said and will I
                    make sure that he understands that the official position of the government of
                    Chad is this. Then I would have the task of trying to massage the Ambassador's
                    telegram to reflect what the Foreign Minister actually said without admitting
                    that the Foreign Minister was calling me up and telling me that he didn't think
                    the Ambassador understood what was going on.</p>
                <p>Then we had the great Peace Corps debacle. As I said earlier I thought a great
                    deal of the Peace Corps. Our Ambassador's wife thought very little of their
                    morals. I must admit a great deal of penicillin was used by the Embassy nurse.
                    She refused to invite any Peace Corps volunteer to her house for the Fourth of
                    July. On learning this I decided to invite any Peace Corps volunteer or other
                    American staff who cared to come to my place for a Fourth of July party. This
                    did not endear me or my wife to the Ambassador. But I just could not leave out
                    the people who were making the greatest contribution to the country. This was
                    unthinkable to me.</p>
                <p>We had other problems. He wrote reviews of my efficiency report on a couple of
                    officers which he showed neither to me nor the officers concerned. When the
                    officers concerned discovered what he had written, which was not what he had
                    said he had written, we had grievance problems and everything else. Again, I am
                    sorry to say, it centered around his wife. He had a real problem coping with
                    that woman who was ill. He finally decided he ought to go.</p>
                <p>The next ambassador, Bill Bradford, came as a fresh breeze. He was an old African
                    hand and he asked if I would stay on another year. I said with the greatest of
                    pleasure. Except for the horrible diplomatic incident I involved his wife in
                    when he first got there, why we got along wonderfully well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the incident?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>DWYER: Well, the French Ambassador had our new Ambassador and the whole Embassy
                    over for dinner shortly after their arrival. Our Ambassador decided to
                    reciprocate and we had the whole French Embassy staff over for a lovely dinner.
                    Jody Bradford, who was an effervescent, attractive, active, good looking blond
                    woman, who was great fun, had at the time pretty rusty French, but this didn't
                    stop her from using it. Here we were having drinks before dinner and the French
                    Ambassador's wife and Mrs. Bradford were talking. Jody grabbed me by the arm as
                    I am going by and says, “Dick, what is the French word for mattress?” Thinking
                    quickly I said “matelot” and went on my way. The French Ambassador's wife had
                    said, “How are you getting on in Chad?” And Jody had said we love it. The only
                    problem is she said that we have the most uncomfortable bed in the world and we
                    have finally gotten a new mattress for it and it is nice and firm and has made
                    all the difference in the world. Now I had just told the Ambassador's wife that
                    the French word for mattress was “matelot” which happened to be sailor and not
                    “matelas” which was mattress. A series of giggles came out of the circle
                    surrounding my Ambassador's wife. Unfortunately, she couldn't figure out what
                    was so funny, but the new firm “matelot” made all the difference to her
                    happiness in Chad. Fortunately she had a wonderful sense of humor. Outside of
                    that we got along wonderfully well. It was great.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we finish this, was there a Libyan problem at the
                        time you were there or did this develop later?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Yes. There was always a Libyan problem. Around 1939 the French government
                    had made an agreement with the Italians about the border between Libya, an
                    Italian colony at the time, and Chad. The fact of the matter was that—I don't
                    know why it was particularly important to either government, it probably was
                    not, because although it composed 10 percent of the area of the country of
                    northern Chad it was mountainous terrain that was home to a few nomads and to
                    the various caravans proceeding north and south. The agreement was signed, but
                    never ratified. I guess the war came along or the government changed or
                    something. After Chadian independence this became a matter of contention between
                    Chad and Libya once again. Of course, the Organization of African Unity and its
                    members had decreed that they would accept colonial borders as established by
                    colonial powers for the simple and good reason that if they all, as new nations,
                    tried to redefined their borders they would collapse into anarchy and civil
                    war.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>Chad was that was part of West Africa that was leftover after everybody took what
                    they wanted—the rest of it they just called Chad. So you had something like a
                    hundred different dialects, the President was from a village a few miles from
                    the Foreign Minister's and the common language was French. The two lingua
                    francas were French and Arabic. Anyway, according to one story there was
                    supposedly traces of uranium found in the mountains. Well, I suppose there may
                    have been some traces there, but uranium has not been in short supply for quite
                    a while and there is no other really good economic reason that I know of for
                    attempting this except for Libyan aggrandizement and the hope that here was an
                    inferior and even weaker power that perhaps they could dominate and bully. They
                    had with them, in those days, the Chadian exiles, Hissen Habre and what have
                    you.</p>
                <p>As a matter of fact I came across a letter in our files from Hissen Habre
                    applying for a Ford Foundation fellowship because Tombalbaye had said to all the
                    Chadians who had been students for five and six years in Paris that enough was
                    enough. If they couldn't learn what they needed to know in five or six years it
                    was too bad, they had to come home. Habre was one of those and he applied for a
                    Ford Foundation fellowship and we turned him down. I suppose if we had given it
                    to him he would never have been Prime Minister of the country. In any event all
                    those people were being given board and room by Qadhafi. Although at that time
                    the Libyan Army was not actually in the country, Qadhafi had built an airstrip
                    and a base just north of the disputed strip. There was no question that he was
                    supplying and supporting the rebels. But as I say, these people in those areas
                    have been rebels for the last thousand years. They are merchant bandits. The
                    difference was that instead of having camels and Enfield rifles they now had
                    landrovers and machine guns which made quite a difference.</p>
                <p>The Chadian army was poorly equipped and organized. The Air Force had World War
                    II fighters, A-6s. They came to me for parts. Upon asking the Pentagon about
                    parts for these propeller driven aircraft, I received a telegram which said that
                    they had located six of them but the museums wouldn't sell them. These were
                    piloted by French pilots under the table and, of course, when—the French do
                    these things so much better than the Americans, it is just infuriating to me
                    that we have not learned how to do these things better. The French had no
                    problem with their public opinion or anything about it and there was no way that
                    I personally felt that we should get involved in this thing. The French would
                    support the Chadians to the extent that it furthered French foreign policy
                    interests which coincided largely as I thought with our own.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>Felix Malloum, who was President, I think had a certain respect for me personally
                    because I had held the fort on the grenade attack on him or so he thought, it
                    didn't actually happen that way, but anyway he came to me and said, “We
                    appreciate your economic aid and we value it but there is no point in trying to
                    use economic aid 'til we have the country pacified because it was just being
                    ripped up once again. What we really need are arms and training.” I had to say
                    to him that it would take a Presidential decision that this was in the best
                    interest of the American government. There is no way that Congress could see to
                    it to agree that these interests are in the national security interests of the
                    United States of America. He said, “Dick I know that, but that is not what I
                    want. I just want $50 million under the table just like you are doing down there
                    in Angola, etc.” I said, “Huh, Mr. President, we don't do that.” And it wasn't
                    two weeks later than some scandal broke in the United States about $50 million
                    to the former Portuguese colonies and was all over the newspapers. He said, “You
                    see? That is all I wanted. I wouldn't have leaked it either.” This destroyed a
                    lot of my credibility.</p>
                <p>He at that time decided that he was going to the United States and plead his own
                    case. I had this embarrassing telegram to send back that President Malloum was
                    going to pay a visit on the American President next Friday. Someone came back
                    with a cable saying he could not receive the president—which I had already told
                    Malloum would be the case, but had agreed to send the telegram anyway—but, we
                    would be happy to receive the vice president and the American Vice President
                    would be happy to meet with him. This was ten times better than I ever thought
                    we were going to do. I sat there and wrote a long telegram back to the
                    Department saying that it was my personal feeling that in no way do we want to
                    get involved in the Libyan war or the civil war...</p>
                <p>[Tape 3, Side 1]</p>
                <p>We agreed we would accept the Vice President of Chad who promptly went off with
                    recommendation from the Embassy that in no way do we give him any encouragement
                    that we were going to take sides in what in essences was a civil war and
                    secondly that there wasn't going to be anything we could do to help him
                    militarily—that was the policy paper of the Department.</p>
                <p>Somewhere along the line, however, the Chadian Vice President came back to me and
                    said I had a wonderful visit and the Vice President has agreed that we should
                    receive aid and he is working on it and I want you to let me know as soon as
                    something comes through. I wired back and said, “What happened?” I got my reply,
                    and I'm still not absolutely sure what happened, but by the time I could get
                    back myself and talk with people—the story was that the Vice President did
                    indeed tell him that and time passed before anybody caught it. Then they went
                    back and redid the memcon so that he didn't quite say that and here I am
                    again—the guy out in the field trying to...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an important thing to remember because we are in a
                        way substituting for documents. Somewhere for future historians there is
                        going to be a memo of conversation in which originally someone said
                        something, but when people look at it closer they realize no, we shouldn't
                        have said this—the thing can be rewritten. This is, of course, the substance
                        of much of what the paper documentation is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: I have no idea whether this actually happened or not, this was the
                    scuttlebutt of what I was told when I could get back and talk with people who
                    supposedly knew.</p>
                <p>In any event it made life very difficult indeed in the field. We ended up
                    finally, after I left, in giving them some training assistance, which I have
                    been a strong foe of in three countries unless we do the damn thing properly.
                    The problem is you tell them that we will give them a grant of $100,000 which
                    sounds like a lot, but what it will do is train two sergeants on how to run a
                    motor pool. Now that is not what they have in mind. They may need it, but that
                    is not at all what they had in mind. They would like some pilot training, which
                    I think we eventually did. But it takes some time to train a fighter pilot.
                    Basically they wanted help in fighting their civil war. We didn't do ourselves
                    any good, particularly. Didn't hurt terribly, I suppose, because the government
                    fell not long afterwards.</p>
                <p>Things were getting dicey again and my wife was saying, “When I lose count of the
                    coup d'etats it is time to go home.” She had been shaken up by the fact—we had
                    gone to a party at one of the embassies, a bridge party. I was feeling a little
                    under the weather and besides I don't like playing bridge in French particularly
                    anyway. We left early and the guy who took the place at our table and his wife
                    were machine gunned as they were crossing the square that we crossed a half hour
                    before. It would have been us if we had been there. That got my wife kind of
                    excited although she is pretty good.</p>
                <p>She was stalwart, you know, during the first coup d'etat. She took in all the
                    wives and the families—we had about six in our house and none at the Residence I
                    might add. So we had a house full of people. She is pretty good—not all that
                    nervous.</p>
                <p>Then on the second anniversary, as I said before, we got to the parade and the
                    tribunal was up there. The President and the Vice President were in the first
                    row, second row was the cabinet, third row the diplomats, and again I was Charg�
                    and in the third row, and everybody else was sitting there. The
                    tribunals....</p>
                <p>I saw the guy throw what I thought was a rock at the President. The rock turned
                    out to be a fragmentation grenade and when it exploded I was torn between,
                    typical Foreign Service bias, because it hit all the press, I am sorry to say I
                    didn't realize at the time, but several of them were killed and it was kind of
                    messy. Then I'll be damned if the guy doesn't heave two more grenades at us.
                    Some misguided patriot on the fourth one grabbed his arm and patriot and grenade
                    thrower disappeared in small juicy pieces together.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>I had been extraordinarily fortunate because I was sitting behind the Minister of
                    Health's wife and she was a great big broad woman. She got pretty badly hurt but
                    I just ruined my last blue suit and the papers I had. I being kind of fat by
                    this time decided that I would simply lie on the floor for a bit, which I did.
                    By the time I got up, I was the last one on the viewing stand. In front of me
                    where the crowds had been—I might say that all this time the army was there
                    waiting in formation for the parade to begin. Ambulances came and took away the
                    wounded and the dead and picked up the pieces. Out in the Place de (inaudible)
                    again are two thousand pairs of shoes where the whole African population had run
                    out of their sandals. I have a slide at home that I took showing nothing but
                    shoes out there.</p>
                <p>The whole diplomatic corps and cabinet had gone over the rear of this reviewing
                    stand which was about, by the time you had the rail up, about 8 feet. They were
                    all arms and legs. The Italian had landed on the Egyptian, and the West German
                    had landed on the East German and there were shouting and cries. I said to
                    myself in isolated splendor out in the reviewing stand, I think I will go home.
                    I wonder where my car and driver are. So I am walking down the steps of the
                    reviewing stand when the Soviet Ambassador comes charging up and says, “Dwyer, I
                    just want you to know that I would not have left the reviewing stand had it not
                    been for the fact that my wife was with me and I wanted to get her to safety.”
                    And I know Sally is in the Cameroon and I said, “Ambassador Sokolov, let's go
                    home and have a drink.” He said, “Well, why not.” About that time the Chinese
                    Ambassador appears out of no where. He speaks no known language beyond Chinese.
                    With the Chinese there the Soviet can't leave and I can see a crisis brewing
                    here. Then the French, East German and the West German came back. The Vice
                    President came back. So the seven of us and the Vietnamese head of security sat
                    there and reviewed the parade. I was just dying because I knew the whole
                    diplomatic corps was sending out telegrams and here I was stuck reviewing the
                    bloody parade for two hours.</p>
                <p>My wife and daughter were in the Cameroon and it, of course, hit the radio which
                    mistakenly said a few diplomats had been killed. Sally gets in the landrover and
                    with my daughter, secretary and chauffeur charged back over to the river only to
                    find that the border is closed and that there is no way you can get across.
                    Sally, therefore, hired a dugout canoe and with my secretary, who was a woman
                    about 63, enormous who always wore a girdle, I never saw her without one—Lavona
                    was a lovely person, a dedicated Foreign Service secretary—Lavona was in the
                    front end of the canoe with the paddler in the rear and my wife and daughter in
                    the middle came across. The next day she walks in the door and I am having a
                    glass of champagne with the new East German Ambassador because it was his turn
                    to call on me. We are sitting there in air-conditioned splendor drinking
                    champagne. My wife comes in with her hair down and muddy up to her knees and she
                    looks in and says, “Are you all right?” I said, “I'm fine Sally.” And she says,
                    “God damn you!” It is hard on family.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>Anyway, by that time the civil war became real, the Egyptian was bound and
                    determined that the rebels were going to try to occupy N'Djamena. I said, “Why?
                    What would they want with it?” By this time, of course, after the military had
                    come in, the French troops had been withdrawn. Lo and behold, however, six
                    months or so after I left, the Habre and Northernists did take over the
                    government of the country. And did receive at a time when the American
                    Administration was particularly looking for nasty things to do to Qadhafi lucked
                    into what they had always wanted— considerable help.</p>
                <p>I might add, I talked to John Blaine, the most recent ambassador to Chad, after
                    he came back —had been DCM once removed before me and is probably the best
                    Chadian hand around. He said that the only thing that really concerned him about
                    the civil war was that the Chadian army really won it. They went out there not
                    with sophisticated weapons but enough landrovers, trucks with machine guns, and
                    they went up there and shot the hell out of the Libyans and isn't it great. Of
                    course, by this time, Habre was fighting...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to stop here now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Yes, I have to go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the second interview with Consul General William
                        Dwyer. Today is September 27, 1990. We left Chad in 1977. You returned to
                        Washington to become an inspector. Is that correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Yes, at that time the Foreign Service Assistance Inspector program had
                    been abolished. This was the inspection program largely AID inspectors who
                    looked at Assistance Programs. Someone, I am not quite who in the upper reaches
                    of the Director General's Office, had decided that it was a good idea in
                    recognition of the Inspection Corps' duties to report to the Secretary of State
                    on the carrying out of American foreign policy in the countries that the regular
                    Foreign Service Inspection Corps should absorb the duties of the former Foreign
                    Assistance Corps. In other words, to analyze the policy implications of our
                    Foreign Assistance Programs abroad. These included not only the usual AID
                    programs, but military assistance programs, etc.</p>
                <p>When I got back from Chad there were two or three job openings and I was
                    interested in the Foreign Service Inspector one principally because of the
                    assistance thing. I had spent three years in Chad watching the convolutions of
                    an AID mission without direction or without much control from anybody and I had
                    some very distinct feelings of how these things should and shouldn't be run.
                    After a few years before in Egypt watching a sizeable military operation I had
                    some ideas about those too. So I rather looked forward to it.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>I think there were eight or nine of us, I don't remember how many—maybe a
                    dozen—that had this particular duty. My first tour of assignment was in South
                    America, the Andean countries. It was Chile, Bolivia, Peru and Ecuador. I
                    thoroughly enjoyed it because I had never been to South America before. When I
                    first came into the Service, it seemed that young officers went to South America
                    and weren't heard from again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I always considered it a black hole. I deliberately never
                        learned Spanish because people did disappear.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Yes, you saw them again at their retirement.</p>
                <p>But it was a very interesting inspection tour with a colleague. We found all
                    kinds of programs that had been established years, and in some cases decades
                    before, that were still ongoing for whatever reason, no one ever knew. Often the
                    ambassador wasn't even aware of it. I can remember a US naval officer on one of
                    the interior rivers of Bolivia which of course is a land locked country. Now
                    what ever purposes such a program might have had it would be hard to
                    justify.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he helping with river gun boats?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Well, not even gun boats. Yes, a river boat of some kind of development.
                    Why it should have been a navy program if it were a worthwhile program and not a
                    civilian program—things like that. We found in Ecuador that the AID
                    program—Ecuador in 1977 for someone like myself coming from Central Africa, and
                    my colleague who came from Saudi Arabia, looked like a beautiful and marvelous
                    country. We found there that we were in effect reinstituting an AID program that
                    had rather gone down hill. One of the problems there was that at that time
                    Congress had a per capita maximum...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If earning over a $1,000 over x many years they wouldn't
                        have an AID program.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: The US government was putting in a sizeable AID program in there at that
                    time on the basis of the fact that the per capita income was under this amount.
                    At the same time the Embassy commercial section was publishing commercial
                    information for businessmen with per capita income half again that much.</p>
                <p>In Chile we found considerable reluctance on the part of military officers to
                    curtail AID programs despite the fact that it was our policy not to cooperate
                    with the Pinochet government.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are backing away from Pinochet.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Exactly. With this extensive military program—there was one fellow down
                    there, I think he was a major or a naval officer who had been down on some
                    island off the Chilean coast on a mapping program—I forget, a mapping program or
                    installation of beacons, or something. It had been going on for 20 or 30
                    years—he could have walked over every step of that tiny island in a couple of
                    years!</p>
                <p>Anyway, there was a lot of that that we found. Often for the first time these
                    were things that some of the ambassadors, at least, had never really wanted to
                    concentrate on or had never done so—often because they were not particularly
                    aware of it. AID was pretty much a self-supporting operation in these countries
                    both in terms of policy as well as finances. The general attitude often seemed
                    to be if they don't make waves leave them alone. There was little policy
                    direction from the ambassadorial side.</p>
                <p>However, we got about half way through there—down in South America at the
                    time—and it turned out that this policy of Foreign Service Assistance Inspectors
                    had been created pretty much within the Department of State and a few Hill
                    staffers discovered it. I can't think of the man's name, one of the more senior
                    political Hill type staffers—the ultimatum was issued by the staffer that we,
                    the Congress, have abolished the Foreign Assistance Program and we don't expect
                    the State Department to take it over. If we wanted it we would have maintained
                    it or recreated it. So there was a lot of covering one's fanny back in
                    Washington. All the voluminous reports that we wrote disappeared as far as I am
                    aware without a trace.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't understand. AID was still going on in these
                        countries. What was it that they had abolished?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: There used to be a Foreign Service Assistance Inspection program that had
                    its own set of inspectors. They were closer to what the inspectors are today, I
                    am sorry to say, in the sense that they were auditors, and what have you. I am
                    not sure whose idea this was originally in State, but the point was that, in his
                    opinion, these are foreign policy tools and as such should be considered in the
                    normal Foreign Service Inspection of how the whole embassy is operating or
                    conducting American foreign policy in that country. It made a great deal of
                    sense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't understand. Congress normally keeps a close eye on
                        squandering of funds. You were out basically to look for programs that were
                        not working weren't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Not really. We weren't auditors, obviously. We were just analyzing or
                    summarizing what the American foreign assistance in a particular country looked
                    like as viewed from American foreign policy for that country.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But in a way even more an auditor would be more likely to
                        look at it in small terms but less likely to say well this isn't really
                        doing much for us as opposed to somebody like yourself. In other words, what
                        I am saying is that you seemed to be going in with the idea of do we really
                        need these things or not...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Not so much do we really need it or not, but are these programs helpful to
                    American foreign policy, and, of course, a lot of them weren't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But why would somebody in Congress be opposed to somebody
                        doing that, because this would result in the ultimate diminution of American
                        expenditures abroad.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: I can't answer directly for the Congressional staff that felt so strongly
                    about it. Except, I would guess, that there were two things about it. First of
                    all, if it were going to be done they didn't particularly want it done by State.
                    We were considered State inspectors and we were looking at a whole bunch of
                    other agency projects—the Peace Corps, all kinds of military assistance. And
                    needless to say, for example, in the days of Pinochet and what have you this was
                    a very tender subject. So, nobody on the Hill ever had a clue of what we were
                    doing. I am not even sure that anyone on the Hill knew we were actually down
                    there. We were not the only ones. The two of us were just down in South America.
                    There were eight, nine or ten of us, I don't remember how many of us there were,
                    scattered around the world in whatever inspection trips happened to be going out
                    at the time. As I say, the reports were quietly filed in the circular file and
                    that was that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever get any feedback from any of the ambassadors
                        saying, “Gee I am glad you told me we got this. I tried to get rid of them
                        after I heard about it...”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>DWYER: In the whole yes, very much so. We had generally a pretty good bunch of
                    ambassadors down there in those days. Two of them in those four countries were
                    brand new and I think the inspection was particularly helpful in those cases.
                    But this was a part of the overall Foreign Service Inspection. A new part, but a
                    part nonetheless. We made our presentations along with the rest of the
                    inspectors at the final interview with the ambassador. He got reports of it, and
                    indeed there were one or two ambassador that I corresponded with quietly a
                    couple of months or longer after I came home. Again, I think it served to bring
                    some of these AID programs, or assistance programs I should say, into
                    perspective for these four ambassadors. There were others that were old hands
                    and—Harry Shlaudeman for example was in Lima at the time and I don't think there
                    was much about the embassy that the inspectors could tell Harry. Still it was a
                    time when the assistance program in Lima was the subject of considerable
                    question as to policy, particularly with the Peruvian government at the time
                    that was buying a lot of East bloc weaponry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a junta, but left wing rather than right, wasn't
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Well, I have almost given up saying these things are right or left wing.
                    Call it radical. Left wing certainly in the sense that they were buying things
                    from the East bloc, but whether it was because of the ideological conviction or
                    the fact that the western countries wouldn't sell it to them.</p>
                <p>But the question always arises to what extent do you or should you use your
                    humanitarian assistance, economic assistance as a tool to attempt to get the
                    government to change their policy on other things. There has always been, I
                    think, particularly on the political side of the State Department and Congress,
                    the feeling that we have more leverage with some of our aid programs than we
                    actually do. We have leverage with programs that can put money in coffers, but
                    not very many of the dictators or military officers are going to worry too much
                    if a program to enhance the agricultural situation of the highland or plateau
                    Indians continues or not. There is not much leverage there. And secondly, you
                    only get to spend this leverage once.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went out did you have the feeling that you were
                        representatives of a new administration, this was the Carter Administration.
                        Human rights were big on their agenda. Did you have the feeling that you
                        were going out and looking at things in a different light than say the
                        Nixon-Ford...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: No. Human rights were indeed important there, but that really was not what
                    we were looking at at all. We were simply looking at the expenditure of
                    resources in the United States mission in a country to determine whether or not
                    it matched what our policy was towards that country—if indeed we could find a

                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Well, we were simply dismantled. We were walking the halls looking for
                    jobs. I stayed on for a few months for a special inspection that I found rather
                    interesting. The Security Division had problems at that time with their program
                    for the security of the Secretary of State. There is a special section...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are talking about the Secretary's personal security,
                        right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: I am talking about SY. Yes, personal security and what have you. There was
                    a branch, and still is, I presume, with about 25 to 30 officers who are assigned
                    to protect the Secretary of State. These are the people like the Secret Service
                    who protect the President. What had happened was two things. Security, of
                    course, with an exception in the early ''60s had never been staffed by regular
                    Foreign Service Officers per se, but with people brought in under special
                    programs who had special qualifications and met special criteria. There was a
                    revamping of the security system a couple of years before that time and they had
                    brought in a remarkably good looking group of young security officers. Everyone
                    had a college degree and there were one or two of them that I interviewed that
                    had Ph.D.s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was with the Board of Examiners and we were doing some
                        of the screening of that group.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: They were good young people—not all so young either as there were some in
                    their '30s with police backgrounds. The Secretary's detail, I suppose had a
                    certain cachet to it, but after a couple of years of standing in the Secretary's
                    backyard all night they begin to think of where do we go from here. The fact was
                    that the Security Division simply did not have room to promote these people.
                    There were a few slots that would be journeymen slots, supervisory slots, they
                    could aspire to but there were not very many of them. Secondly because this
                    thing had been started a few years before and the Security Division expanded, on
                    occasion people of the same rank were reviewing officers of the same rank as
                    themselves. Therefore they were writing efficiency reports on people that they
                    would compete with for promotion, which was undesirable.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>The head of Security at that time had decided that he wanted to replace the chief
                    of the Secretary's detail and he did it remarkably and aptly. In the first
                    place, the chief of the Secretary's detail was a long time security officer. His
                    efficiency reports were uniformly good including reviews written by the head of
                    Security. One would think that any good bureaucrat would realize that he should
                    be careful about trying to fire the guy that sits in the front of the
                    Secretary's limousine everyday, because this guy has access that nobody in
                    security has had ever before or since. When they tried to move this fellow to
                    permit one of the newer, younger—they found themselves threatened with grievance
                    procedures. Secondly, a very irate Secretary of State who asked the Director
                    General to try and straighten out this mess.</p>
                <p>That took two or three months. We finally got the head of Security to agree to
                    find this guy a position that was at least equal in importance and supervisory
                    responsibilities that he would grudging accept. But more important as we got
                    into it we uncovered the deep unhappiness of the whole detail which went far
                    beyond our mandate. Once these younger officers found there was someone there
                    who would listen to them—I think I had about everyone in there pouring out their
                    troubles. I don't know if we did them any good or not, but we tried. It was
                    rather interesting concept. The then head of Security who was trying to make
                    this into a modern agency—his motives were excellent and you can sympathize with
                    him, but in a bureaucracy you simply can't fire a man without apparent reason or
                    move them to a job...</p>
                <p>Anyway, after a job or two like that I was walking the halls trying to find
                    myself a job. John Burke, who was then our ambassador in Guyana, was in the
                    Department looking for a DCM. I had known John very slightly when he was head of
                    the Vietnam working group, or deputy head, when I was on Scandinavian affairs.
                    The Vietnamese working group was very unhappy with the Scandinavians in general,
                    so we had some contact there. We had been back in Washington—we returned from
                    Chad in '77 and by now it is the spring of '78 and Andy Young had visited
                    Guyana. He was the Ambassador to the United Nations. He got along very well with
                    the then Deputy Chief of Mission in Guyana and offered him a job at the UN as
                    his office manager for him for the US Mission. He needed a Foreign Service
                    Officer that he liked and could trust. So this fellow left and John Burke was
                    looking for a new DCM. He offered me the job and although I really didn't want
                    to go to Guyana under the best of circumstances...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is not the garden spot...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>DWYER: It is not the garden spot. I had a daughter in prep school—while in Africa
                    we had an education allowance and hardship allowance which allowed me to send
                    her away to school. When she came back to the United States we again put her in
                    prep school because we didn't know where we would be. So financially it looked
                    like a good deal and there didn't seem to be much else around. And besides I
                    rather preferred to serving in the field than Washington anyway. John Burke was
                    someone I thought I could work with reasonably and easily. So we had a
                    conversation and he said if interested he needed me right away. My long
                    suffering wife said okay you go down and I will close up the house again and
                    have it painted after the last tenants. I agreed that I would come back for a
                    week in June for the in-laws 50th wedding anniversary and finish helping her.
                    And that was what we did. John was agreeable to this. I came back from Guyana
                    for a week in June and brought the family back with me.</p>
                <p>In the various briefings that I had in Washington before going to Guyana—by this
                    time I had been out before as a DCM and had been a Desk Officer for several
                    years and arranged briefings for everyone and was at home with the process
                    knowing whom to see—I think I covered all the bases.</p>
                <p>I would say the largest question about my tour in Guyana, or most significant
                    event, was the tragedy of Jonestown, the group of people up at
                    Jonestown—American citizens living there—came up in my briefings only once or
                    twice. The ambassador mentioned them to me in his briefings saying that they
                    were up there and that would be something for me to keep an eye on when we got
                    down there. The Desk Officer had visited Jonestown in Guyana and was besieged by
                    letters, he said, from the People's Temple and those opposed to the People's
                    Temple—as a matter of fact he had a window sill full of letters that he hadn't
                    gotten around to opening yet. His view was that it was something that I would
                    have to make up my own mind about. I asked what kind of responsibilities did we
                    have for these people. He said, “Well, we don't really have very much as long as
                    they are there willingly, obviously.” And lastly, the then chief of the consular
                    section was up on business to Washington when I was getting my briefings and he
                    had made two or three visits down there and described a little bit about what
                    the settlement looked like and what his consular responsibilities were
                    there.</p>
                <p>In effect, however, I must say that I didn't think of it in terms of the kind of
                    a problem that it was going to turn out to be, obviously. It was more curiosity
                    than anything else. The consular officer had told me that he had on his regular
                    visit up there talked to people and knew of no one that wanted to leave.
                    Certainly no one had told him. He periodically had conversations with everyone
                    up there whose relatives had inquired about. So then it didn't seem to me to be
                    that important.</p>

                <p>DWYER: Well, most of the people at Jonestown were black, but not the whole

                    all white.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DWYER: No, nothing like that. I don't think anybody in the Department, including
                    where it should have been of the most interest, namely the Consular Affairs
                    section, had paid any attention to it. I think the only one paying any attention
                    to it really were the people in and around the Desk, if only because they were
                    being besieged by well-organized campaigns of letters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the letter campaign about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: I didn't really know. None of this was I aware of at the time, I must say.
                    Not until I got down there and then well after that. The major case there was
                    the question of a child—who were the parents of this child and who should be
                    awarded custodianship or guardianship of the child. That was the thing that I
                    was to discover that the Embassy had spend as much or more time on it.</p>
                <p>It was a case of aides to Jim Jones, again, both white, who were married—Tim
                    Stone and his wife. Stone was a lawyer, who had, I think, previously been
                    assistant DA in Los Angeles, and a member of the People's Temple. They had a
                    child. The question was whether the child was fathered by Tim Stone or by Jim
                    Jones. Jim Jones maintained that he was the father—so did Tim Stone's wife,
                    Grace, for a certain period of time. Stone left the People's Temple. His wife
                    Grace stayed behind. Then she left the Temple. They then attempted to get
                    custodianship of this child in Guyana that Jim Jones said was his child and
                    maintained his mother was not a competent mother. Now there had been documents
                    signed, I believe, by Mrs. Stone saying that Jim Jones was the father. Anyway it
                    was a...</p>

                </p>
                <p>DWYER: It was a typical consular mess of the worst kind possible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But nothing earth shaking.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Well, you know I think these are the dirtiest jobs of the consular
                    officer. I was never really a consular officer for very long, but the cases that
                    were the most heartrending and difficult certainly were child custody cases.</p>
                <p>The case had been brought before the courts in Guyana and was to be cited by the
                    Supreme Court of Guyana. But before I left Washington, I am not actually sure I
                    had heard the name, although I may have heard that there was a child custody
                    case down there that the Embassy was trying to insure that the courts heard
                    promptly and fairly. But as I say this was not at all a major part of my
                    briefing at the time or my preparations.</p>
                <p>At the time I was going down there the central electric system in the city of
                    Georgetown, the capital, had failed. They were finding it impossible to keep
                    running. Not only did you have problems simply with drinking water, but the
                    hospitals had no electricity, although some of them had backup generators, they
                    couldn't get fuel because the country was going broke—and still is—but the water
                    system was down because it depended on the electricity. Georgetown is some six
                    to eight feet below sea level and the pumps that pump the water—I should say
                    that Georgetown is on the sea coast. Immediately behind Georgetown are swamps
                    from which Georgetown gets its fresh water, and which in effect washes out the
                    town's sewage system. At low tide the pumps go on and the water in the canal is
                    pumped out into the sea. The gates of the dams are then closed and the water
                    comes in from the back of the town from the reservoirs which not only supply
                    drinking water, but more importantly are an important factor in the cleanliness
                    of the town.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>We had established a task force in Washington with the Office of Emergency
                    Preparedness, or whatever it is now, and included a couple of army engineers,
                    particularly one or two people from the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta. I
                    must say their portrait of what could happen to Georgetown and Guyana without
                    electricity and the probability of communicable diseases was really rather
                    scary. In effect, what we finally did was to bring down a team to refurbish a
                    couple of generators that we had sold the Guyanese many years before and been
                    allowed to deteriorate—these were railway diesels and the railway diesels, of
                    course, generate electricity and these were emergency supplies. I spent a great
                    deal of my time with this task force before we went down there. The Embassy at
                    the time was considering whether to evacuate unnecessary staff and dependents
                    because of the water situation. Also it was leading to civil unrest. People were
                    digging up water mains from the ground and knocking holes in them to get at the
                    water, thereby getting a few cups of water maybe but in effect destroying the
                    water and sewage system, which unfortunately had little or no maintenance since
                    the British had left fifteen years before.Anyway, that was what I would say I
                    spent most of my time on.</p>
                <p>I arrived in Guyana in April of '78 and found it not an unpleasant town. It was
                    certainly no body's garden spot of delights but the Guyanese themselves were
                    certainly amongst the most attractive people that I had ever served with—open
                    and friendly.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, where were we?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: I had just arrived in Guyana. We had a small mission there. The political
                    section was two or three officers; a consular section with three or four
                    officers; an economic section which was a one man section, plus the help of one
                    of our two interns—I guess the consular section was a little bigger, there must
                    have been half a dozen, I guess. We were understaffed the whole time I was
                    there, which was not surprising in Guyana. There was a fairly large AID mission
                    which had been going to be reduced considerably and had indeed been reduced, but
                    thanks to the Carter Administration and I suspect not a little part to Andy
                    Young, it began to look as if our relations were going to improve a little bit
                    with the Guyanese so our AID program was slowly being refinanced. Interestingly
                    enough, although we had cut off a large part of new funds to the AID program we
                    didn't lose any of the officers down there. We had the whole staff there and we
                    began again.</p>
                <p>Guyana, then and now, was a mix of people and races. Depending on how you count,
                    some 52 percent East Indians, some 40-odd percent black, another 5 percent of
                    mixed type including some Chinese, Portuguese, and a very small number, I would
                    guess less than 1 percent of Western Europeans or British who had stayed on.
                    There had been riots which preceded independence immediately and indeed
                    independence had been pushed off for some time.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>The East Indian population largely voted in block for a leader who was Cheddi
                    Jagan. Jagan was an American educated dentist who had married an American
                    citizen, Janet, during his years at Northwestern. He was head of the
                    pseudo-communist party of Guyana, and certainly took his marching orders from
                    Moscow. The Soviets had a large embassy there as did the Libyans, Chinese and
                    various other third world countries as Guyana saw itself as a third world
                    leader. Jagan was, I suspect, probably a very sincere radical socialist, or
                    communist or whatever. However, by far the brightest one of the family was his
                    wife, Janet, who had served as a minister in the government at one point before
                    independence when Jagan had been Prime Minister. He and Janet were a working
                    team. I haven't looked down there recently, I don't know what has happened to
                    them. I must do so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But when you were there...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: These were the opposition. With independence, Forbes Burnham, a
                    charismatic black leader, had become Prime Minister and stayed Prime Minister
                    for indefinitely until his death. I guess he became President towards the end
                    there, if I recall correctly.</p>
                <p>But in essence the East Indian population in Guyana were composed of the sugar
                    plantation laborers, the farm laborers, and the agricultural people. There were
                    some business people in the East Indian population, although the Portuguese and
                    Chinese were prominent there too. What had happened was that when slavery was
                    abolished in 1834, all through the Caribbean—and although Guyana is on the
                    mainland of South America, it is really more a Caribbean country than a South
                    American one—when the British abolished slavery in 1834 the plantation owners
                    all over the Caribbean were looking for new laborers because almost en mass the
                    blacks left the plantations where they could. On some of the small islands, of
                    course, they couldn't get away. But in Guyana they sure could and they just
                    walked off the plantations in large part. There was an attempt to bring in
                    Portuguese largely from the Canary Islands. They did not remain laborers very
                    long and became small merchants, grocery store owners, jewelry store
                    operators—if throughout the Caribbean today, all the big jewelry stores still
                    are, for some reason, Portuguese.</p>
                <p>Next they tried the Chinese. They lasted a little longer than the Portuguese. And
                    finally the East Indians, both Pakistani and Indian—Moslems and Hindu. That
                    proved much more successful. They were brought over in groups so that they
                    maintained their own civilization, language and religion, which the blacks when
                    they were slaves were never permitted to do. It was illegal to teach a black to
                    read, it was illegal in many cases to convert them to religion, etc. The idea
                    being that there should be no organizing force. So, in addition to the fact that
                    the blacks were brought from a variety of regions of Africa and did not have the
                    cohesiveness of the East Indians...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the situation when you arrived, I am trying to focus
                        more on...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Yes, well, by this time the black population ran the government, ran the
                    army, a large part, but not all, of the law profession, and the school teachers
                    and the bureaucracy. The East Indians were the agricultural laborers and
                    merchants, and part of the law fraternity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived there, what did you see as our interest
                        in the place other than just maintaining a presence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Probably the most important consideration of American foreign policy, the
                    Carter Administration included, was that there be more or less tranquility in
                    this area. Cheddi Jagan was an avowed follower of Moscow, if not an avowed
                    communist, although he said once or twice that he was proud to take his line
                    from the communists. The British, before they left, had really not wanted to
                    turn the country over to Jagan. The Americans and the Brits, had supported
                    Forbes Burnham in the early days of independence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm still trying to get us back to when you arrived.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Okay, you don't want a history of Guyana.</p>
                <p>Well, in any event, when we got there Forbes Burnham had been in power since
                    independence. Elections generally were nicely and politely rigged. Cheddi Jagan
                    had problems, one of which was that Forbes Burnham was a hell of a lot smarter
                    than Cheddi Jagan. One political anecdote that I always remember was an exchange
                    in parliament between Cheddi Jagan, the leader of the opposition, and Forbes
                    Burnham, Prime Minister, when the government had been caught open-handedly,
                    flagrantly, in some political misdeed. Jagan got up and said, “Mr. Prime
                    Minister, I think no one in this country will disagree with me when I say that
                    you have been caught with your trousers down.” The Prime Minister arose and
                    said, “Well, be as it may be, but at least if I have been caught with my
                    trousers down, there is something to see.”</p>
                <p>So you had a country that had a high level of education. The British educational
                    system had been excellent. Burnham, himself, was a lawyer, he had gotten his law
                    degree at the Inns of the Temple in London, he had been a Guyana scholar. Every
                    year in the British colonies in those days they chose one scholar to be the
                    scholar of the country and Forbes Burnham had been that. He was articulate and
                    knew how to appeal to the black masses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did we see any...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>DWYER: Our problem there was, and it wasn't that much of a problem—what we didn't
                    want was a Cuba on the coast of South America. Burnham had not gotten in recent
                    years the kind of economic and financial support that he had hoped to get from
                    the United States. His politics were becoming increasingly unsavory...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean in terms of corruptness and...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Yes. The country was riddled by corruption—moral and economic. To get
                    along you had to know who to see and how to see it. If you wanted your son or
                    daughter to go away to school somewhere to a university and needed foreign
                    exchange, well, you were careful not to speak out against the government too
                    publicly.</p>
                <p>Our American concerns were, as I said, number one the stability of an anti- or at
                    least non-communist government in the area. We didn't want to see Cheddi Jagan
                    become a Prime Minister. We believed at the Embassy at that time that the Soviet
                    and Libyan embassies were centers for intelligence and perhaps the worst for
                    that area of the Caribbean, to say nothing of the Cuban embassy, of course.
                    There was a large Cuban presence. Burnham liked to think of Castro as a peer—a
                    fellow third world leader.</p>
                <p>Secondly, the only real economic interests we had in Guyana was the fact that the
                    United States' steel mills were supplied with 80 percent of their calcine
                    bauxite from Guyana. Burnham had nationalized the bauxite mines. With the usual
                    Guyanese unhappy luck he nationalized them just before the bottom dropped out of
                    the market, but he was in effect making payments on it. They were at least
                    attempting to make payments on it, so we had no real problem there. I think, if
                    the truth be told, the aluminum companies, Alcoa, Reynolds and Alcon, probably
                    were happy to get out.</p>
                <p>Calcine bauxite is a particular kind of bauxite. It is used to make refractory
                    bricks used in steel mills. The only other source of calcine bauxite at that
                    time was China which was equally doubtful. Of course, as the steel industry
                    modernized, there was less and less need for this kind of bauxite. Secondly, as
                    I mentioned before, the whole of the aluminum industry at that time was
                    bottoming out and the American economy was slowing down. So the importance of
                    this was not all that earth shaking.</p>
                <p>So those were our two main interests there in addition to trying to assist a
                    country to modernize.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, I guess, probably we ought to turn to how, from your
                        prospective, did the Jonestown episode play out.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>DWYER: Well, Jonestown was up in the bush in the northwest portion of the
                    country—150 miles by chartered airplane from Georgetown. There were no
                    commercial communications with the area at Jonestown which was located at a
                    small town called Port Kaituma. Port Kaituma was an inland port on the river
                    that had been established by an American mining company for manganese. There
                    were manganese mines to the northwest of Port Kaituma. Guyana is one of the few,
                    perhaps the only country of the Caribbean, if not South America, that is not
                    overpopulated. There were 7 or 800,000 Guyanese there and largely along the
                    coast—largely agricultural still. The inland was very thinly settled. There were
                    some ranches up in the Rupununi where Guyana borders Brazil.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the communications were ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Jonestown, itself, was settled in an area of Guyana which was a
                    territorial dispute with the Venezuelans. Venezuela claimed a large portion of
                    that country. I don't know for a fact, but I would presume that one of the
                    reasons that this area was open to Jim Jones and his People's Temple was the
                    fact that the government probably thought that a settlement of Americans up
                    there might not be a bad thing in terms of their territorial disputes with
                    Venezuela.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long had Jonestown been there when you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Oh, I should have read up on these things, I don't remember now. I think
                    it was about '76—two years. It was not the first settlement of its kind up
                    there. There had been another American settlement of a similar nature that
                    hadn't made a go of it and failed. There had been at least one or two groups of
                    Jamaicans that had undertaken such things and had largely reverted to growing
                    marijuana and dreadlocks.</p>
                <p>The Jonestown settlement was the only one which came in with a sizeable amount of
                    money and organizational ability. Jones, himself, had come down to the
                    settlement in 1977—the reasons why he came and brought the people was something
                    I learned afterwards rather than before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We should probably not concentrate so much on that because
                        if somebody is interested they can read up on that, I am mainly interested
                        in how we saw it at the time and what happened.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Shortly after I got there, Ambassador Burke suggested that one of the
                    first things I ought to do was visit Jonestown along with the chief of the
                    consular section, Dick McCoy. I went up there shortly after I got to Georgetown.
                    There were, I suppose, 900 to a thousand people there at the time.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>We always had problems getting up there. I come from a family whose father and
                    brothers have always flown light aircraft and had such aircraft in the family. I
                    was used to flying around the countryside in small airplanes. But I was not at
                    all happy given the tropical weather conditions of sending any consular officer
                    up there in a single engine airplane. So we always tried to have two fans on
                    whatever we chartered to go up there. We could have, and occasionally did, the
                    consular officer go up to a settlement, where there was a manganese mine, north
                    of Port Kaituma, and then take a little railway that had been established to
                    bring the ore down to the port, but this was a chancy thing and it would take
                    the better part of 5 or 6 days to do. Whereas, if we chartered an airplane we
                    could go up there in an hour and a half. There was an airstrip about six or
                    seven miles from the settlement, itself. If we could rely on the single
                    government landrover up there to take us out to Jonestown that was what we did.
                    So there was considerable logistic planning to get out there. We would have to
                    beg, borrow or otherwise find an airplane to charter.</p>
                <p>Anyway, McCoy and I went up there shortly after I got there. With all these
                    preparations this was not something that you could walk into unannounced. There
                    was simply no way that you could walk into Jonestown unannounced. Jonestown had
                    a headquarters in Georgetown, itself, staffed by half a dozen to fifteen people.
                    They were very, very active in keeping their problems before the local
                    government—from the Customs to the Chief of Police to the Supreme Court. The
                    Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, for example, had a wife who was very ill and
                    she had been carefully befriended by two or three women from the Jonestown
                    settlement who lived in Georgetown. They would visit her every other day or so;
                    talk with her and bring her an occasional gift of goodies that were not
                    available. After she died, he was eternally grateful to the People's Temple for
                    the kindnesses they had shown his wife. This was the kind of thing they did.
                    That on one level and on another level they went out and seduced the Guyanese
                    Ambassador to the United States—gave him a live-in friend, who stayed with him
                    until he shot her dead a couple of years after Jonestown. So from the seductress
                    to the decent people helping out a sick woman they pretty much covered all their
                    bases. Again, I was far from aware of all these things before we got up there.
                    But people in Georgetown had a pretty good intelligence as to what was going
                    on.</p>
                <p>When McCoy and I got up there that first day I can't think when it was—April or
                    May—but in any event they had obviously put on a little show for my benefit.
                    McCoy had been up there a few times previously, but they had organized in their
                    pavilion, there main meeting place, bits of their handicrafts, what they grew,
                    what they made, arranged a tour of the facilities for me. Very much a dog and
                    pony show.</p>
                <p>Jonestown, itself, as I said was six or seven miles from Port Kaituma, while
                    there were no fences around it or barbed wire as its detractors maintained in
                    drawings and text, it was nonetheless isolated. For city people, which a large
                    percentage of Jonestown rank and file were, the tropical forest was
                    unquestionably daunting.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>Jonestown did include a number of people who were farmers. Ironically, Jim Jones
                    came from a small town in Indiana, Muncie, Indiana, not far from where I grew up
                    in the northern part of the state and I wouldn't be surprised if we met one
                    another in some high school exchange in those days. But he had started out with
                    a bunch of people who often were farmers. They would follow him from California
                    and then to Guyana. These were the people who ran his farm down there.</p>
                <p>They had built a bunch of cabins. A subsequent consular officer said it reminded
                    him of his first day at summer camp. It was badly overcrowded at that time,
                    although, I must say, it was not apparent to me. It was overcrowded because
                    there had been a small group of Temple people who had come down to build the
                    camp. And then when Jones came down he brought with him almost everyone from Los
                    Angeles so there was an influx of several hundred people and they were still
                    building dormitories.</p>
                <p>Dick McCoy conducted his consular business with his usual competence and
                    efficiency. He had a meeting of all the People's Temple members there who were
                    new parents and had babies. He told them how to register their children as
                    American citizens; how to register their marriage or arrange for recognition of
                    their relationship, etc. He also interviewed privately every person up there
                    that had been a source of concern to relatives and parents in the States. I
                    don't know how many of these cases there were, probably a half a dozen or a
                    dozen each time.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile I was making the grand tour and it was a kind of weird experience.
                    Jonestown had, I presume they bought, but they may have been given a half hour
                    or a forty-five minute program on the Georgetown radio at least once a
                    week—maybe more often. It was a publicity and propaganda type thing of what they
                    were doing with forests, how many acres they had cleared, what they had grown,
                    how they were establishing their big farm, their chicken ranch, cattle, how they
                    were developing new crops, etc. It sounded very impressive on the radio. Indeed
                    at first glance, Jonestown, itself, was very impressive. It reminded me of the
                    early days in a kibbutz in Israel. There was still a great deal of that
                    enthusiasm. What was weird was that as they were taking me around to look at
                    these things, these things were being described in exactly the same words I had
                    heard on the radio program just the week before. In other words, they were
                    rote.</p>
                <p>Still, Jim Jones' wife had been a nurse and her particular interest was the
                    children center and nursery and obviously there were infants there, fat and
                    happy and well cared for. There school system appeared quite decent. This had
                    been a bone of contention between the Guyanese and Jonestown. The Guyanese
                    Minister of Education's nose was out of joint that these people should establish
                    a school of their own when Guyana had abolished all private schools a few years
                    before.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>There problem was that the tropical soil is good for a couple of years of crops
                    and then it is leached out. It is very thin. The tropical forest is not a
                    fertile place for crops. This was what all the sugar and tobacco planters in
                    Guyana had found. They had been established along the rivers as was Jonestown
                    and when the rivers gave out they moved to the coast where the tidal water
                    changes that I described before had been used to refertilize the soil.</p>
                <p>Jones, himself was not a very practical man in the sense of getting things done
                    or understanding practicality. He was an idealist or maybe a pragmatist who
                    relied on ideology to move other people. He described to me a machine that his
                    people were making that was going to use garbage to produce methane gas. With
                    methane gas they would run their caterpillar tractors, tractors and what have
                    you. He went on at length how they had made in the jungles of Guyana major
                    scientific advances on this concept. Obviously there is a concept and it can be
                    done. The fact is, however, that still in an industrialized society this often
                    costs far more than the fossil fuel it is to replace.</p>
                <p>Anyway, he continued on about this and turned to this fellow and asked where is
                    the machine. It turned out he was leaning his hand on it while he was talking to
                    me. He didn't recognize what he had been talking about!</p>
                <p>At lunch someone came up and Jones excused himself saying he had something he had
                    to take care of. I was left with Marcy Jones, his wife. She used that
                    opportunity to make what had obviously been a preplanned presentation to me on
                    the subject of the child about whom there was a custody battle saying that Jim
                    Jones had fathered this child with her permission. That they had done it for the
                    mental health of the mother and they recognized that it was a horrible mistake
                    and should never had been done. But the child was growing up happy and well and
                    well educated and not the child of a broken home as he would have if he had been
                    returned to one or other of his parents, etc. It was a most uncomfortable twenty
                    minutes for any political officer.</p>
                <p>Marcy Jones continued after saying that the child custody situation was one that
                    they regretted and that Jim Jones was indeed the true father of the child with
                    her permission, to indicate that she, of course, couldn't really say with any
                    certainty herself, but Jim Jones was not only a man of genius but many people
                    firmly believed, including people there, that he could and had worked
                    miracles—hands on faith healing, etc. This had been, indeed, an embarrassing
                    situation for the Catholic hierarchy in Georgetown where a Jesuit priest had
                    loaned them a Catholic church and in the best traditions of somewhat fraudulent
                    fundamentalism Jim Jones had pulled out the cancers, chicken livers, what have
                    you, of sick people in the Catholic church which did not endear him any longer
                    to the editor of the local Catholic newspaper who was the guy who had loaned him
                    the church.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>Anyway, this was obviously their presentation to me as DCM coming up there and I
                    have no doubt that it was carefully orchestrated but then again I would have
                    been very surprised had it not been carefully orchestrated. The kinds of
                    allegations that were made against Jonestown, made by relatives and friends of
                    people there who had organized themselves on the west coast, I forget what it
                    was called, but it was a formal organization, was that people were being kept at
                    Jonestown against their will. That they were being mistreated, overworked, and
                    suffering from malnutrition.</p>
                <p>You mentioned earlier that this was still in the Carter Administration. We were
                    operating in the Foreign Service under a very strict set of rules, or more
                    conscientiously than in the old days. We were forbidden, for example, to record
                    any telephone calls that the Embassy got. This was worldwide not just Guyana
                    directives. We were told that the American citizens had the same rights of
                    privacy as they did in the United States. In other respects as well, we were
                    conscientiously trying to walk a very narrow line between these two opposing
                    groups. The Jonestown people, as far as we could see, were not physically
                    abused. They were wiry and there was no question that they worked hard to
                    accomplish what they did, but none maintained that they were forced to do so or
                    leave. None of the people that McCoy interviewed privately expressed a desire to
                    leave. One of the principal aides of Jim Jones, a woman named Maria—I can't
                    remember her last name, thought I would never forget it—came from a Greek
                    family. Her father and brother in California were very, very much concerned
                    about her. Before my arrival in Guyana, I know the father had traveled to Guyana
                    to see her daughter. He wanted to see her outside of Jonestown. She had come to
                    Georgetown and had had an interview with her father. McCoy was there as was one
                    or two other people. She said in no uncertain terms that she did not want to go
                    back to the United States. She was happy where she was, and even went so far as
                    to accuse her father of sexual abuse when she was a child. Maria was atypical in
                    the sense that she was one of the leaders and organizers of the People's Temple.
                    Her father remained convinced that if he could possibly get her away into a home
                    environment back in the State, she might radically change. I met her only once
                    or twice. She was an attractive woman but with fire in her eyes. Someone who
                    devoutly believed in her cause whatever it may have been, and I suspect in Jim
                    Jones. Allegedly she had been his mistress, he changed mistresses with some
                    frequency, but Maria was still a senior member of his staff.</p>
                <p>This was the kind of thing that the People's Temple did quite often. They had
                    their members sign or write and say accusations against family and parents or
                    others that were quite shocking—childhood abuse was one of the greatest. You can
                    imagine then, here is the Embassy in the middle of this case, the father who
                    wants his daughter back and the daughter who is over 21 and says she has no
                    current animosity towards her father but she doesn't want to go back and besides
                    that she was molested as a child. Obviously these are not things for embassies
                    to decide. They are legal matters.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>Others were much more simple in the sense that a mother would write and say I
                    haven't heard from my child for a long time would you please talk to them and
                    tell them to write me. Undoubtedly there was a censorship in Jonestown. We now
                    know that people were told what to write to parents and friends. But still very
                    few of them, I suspect, ever wanted to leave or expressed an opinion to an
                    Embassy officer or anyone else that they wanted to leave until the day of the
                    tragedy of Jonestown.</p>
                <p>So, McCoy and I went back to Georgetown. We talked with Ambassador Burke and
                    relayed our impressions. I think what many of us had anticipated then and in the
                    future was that this whole thing could well fall apart at the seams and we would
                    have a thousand Americans at the door of the Embassy who needed support to get
                    home and maintenance. That was our worse case scenario, I think. There had been
                    one case before I got there of a guy who had left Jonestown and said that he had
                    been beaten while there. He probably had been.</p>
                <p>The people at Jonestown were a mix. The large proportion of them were urban
                    black, many from the ghettos. There were many elderly people there that were
                    called the seniors. These undoubtedly had an attraction for Jones because they
                    had Social Security benefits that were sent to them in Guyana which they would
                    then endorse. The money went to the People's Temple. It was a matter of concern
                    to the Social Security Administration late in the day when some of the publicity
                    began to appear. I talked to two or three of the older people there on my first
                    visit—just casually, off hand. I found that they were highly supportive of
                    Jones. One old lady told me that where she lived in Watts she was afraid to go
                    down to her mailbox to get her Social Security check because the gangs would be
                    waiting on Social Security day for people to do that. While in Jonestown she had
                    people to take care of her and didn't have to worry about her physical security
                    and indeed she had trouble walking and a young child was always with her every
                    day.</p>
                <p>I couldn't say, certainly, that I had had expressed to me any unhappiness with
                    Jonestown. It was a weird place, but the mere fact that they would choose to
                    establish themselves a 150 miles into the bush was weird to begin with.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>To continue the Jonestown side of things, to go over it fairly rapidly, the
                    Embassy continued to get requests from parents and relatives to look in on
                    people. We continued to do so. We tried to get up there at least once every
                    quarter which we generally did until later in the summer of '78. We had a new
                    consul by that time, McCoy had gone back to be Desk Officer in the Department at
                    the urging of Ambassador Burke who wanted someone on the desk who knew about
                    Jonestown which was beginning to look increasingly as a problem. The Embassy
                    sent in to the Department in early summer or late spring a telegram describing
                    the situation with Jonestown as best as we could see it. In essence the telegram
                    said that as far as we can tell, Jonestown is a state unto itself. There is very
                    little supervision over it by the Guyanese government. And recommended that the
                    Embassy go in and urge the Guyanese government to monitor the situation up there
                    more carefully so that they as well as we could be more responsive to complaints
                    that were coming.</p>
                <p>These complaints, I might add, were all orchestrated. There were complaints on
                    both sides. The Jonestown people complained about being harassed by the American
                    Embassy, about being the subject of a CIA plot, that there had been shots fired
                    at them by would be terrorists from the families, etc. There was no middle
                    ground. You had two polarized camps here.</p>
                <p>In any event, after some urging we finally got a reply from Washington saying
                    that we don't think you should make any representations to the Guyanese
                    government at this time as it might be considered interference with the
                    government of Guyana. Somewhere about then we were notified that a congressional
                    delegation would be coming to see us. This would be a delegation of two or three
                    congressmen led by Congressman Leo Ryan of California, whose district included a
                    number of constituents both among the relatives and amongst the people in
                    Jonestown itself. But looking back on it it was amazing how little we knew about
                    what had happened in California with the People's Temple or about Ryan or what
                    he knew or for that matter what Consular Affairs in the Department of State
                    knew.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>Ryan had been a high school teacher and had a friend whose grandchildren were at
                    Jonestown and who was very concerned about them. The father of these children
                    had been killed in an alleged accident in a railroad yard in Los Angeles. The
                    suspicion being but never proved that the People's Temple were responsible for
                    it—that it was in fact a murder. The mother had taken the children to Jonestown.
                    So it was a very personal concern of Congressman Ryan's.And something else that
                    I had been unaware of until he told us, John Burke and myself on his arrival,
                    that he had a daughter who was very much involved in the Church of Scientology
                    and he thought they did much good work. Thus he wasn't necessarily against all
                    cults, but that he had had some experience with that. Subsequent to Jonestown,
                    of course, the daughter became a follower of the Marisha Yelt where ever it was,
                    Idaho or Wyoming—she was in another cult. It was interesting because this kind
                    of devotion to the cult and to the leader were very similar to what you found at
                    Jonestown. So Ryan had some, I presume, personal interest in this as well as his
                    official interest. He had, of course, been well known for some highly publicized
                    investigation of baby seals in Canada or Alaska. He had gone in as a prisoner at
                    a high security jail in California for a week to experience what that was like.
                    He had been a leader in getting the congress to pass a resolution urging the
                    pardoning of Patty Hearst. In other words, a man who had had some experience
                    with publicity and unusual ways to get it. Nonetheless his interest in
                    Jonestown, I think, was very real.</p>
                <p>But we knew very little about any of this when we simply got a telegram from
                    Washington saying that this delegation is interested in coming down and are
                    thinking of bringing a whole delegation—including a psychiatrist. We kind of
                    looked at this thing and said to ourselves—what do these people think they are
                    going to do about these people in Jonestown, tell them that they are now going
                    to be subject to a congressional investigation and compulsory psychiatric exam
                    or something. What we were never aware of until after the fact was that Leo Ryan
                    and his principal aide, his legislative assistant, I never thought her name
                    would slip my mind either (it will come back), had had a couple of briefings in
                    the State Department. They had met with People's Temple in—or the parents
                    extensively—in Los Angeles. They had extensive notes and information of the
                    people up there in Jonestown. Piecing it together later it became apparent that
                    Congressman Ryan could not get any other member of his committee to go with him
                    to Guyana. Everybody else had backed out, one at the last moment. Such official
                    congressional visits, or committee visits, were normally to be conducted by two
                    congressmen, which was part of the delay in their getting down there. He won his
                    chairman's consent to go by himself with one committee staffer. The committee
                    staffer by happenstance had been a former Foreign Service Officer who I knew
                    slightly. He had gone through Russian language school when I had gone through
                    Bulgarian language school.</p>
                <p>In any event on behalf of the congressman we relayed copies of letters from him
                    that he had written directly or had given to the People's Temple lawyers stating
                    his desire to visit Jonestown and meet with Jim Jones and talk to the people
                    there.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>Jonestown leadership, or Jim Jones, or somebody, organized a petition that they
                    did not want this man to visit Jonestown. He had a conservative bias that would
                    not permit him to understand the great socialist experiment that they were
                    building as witness his voting record for Argentina, etc. Obviously they had
                    quite a good dossier on him. In any event he was simply unwelcome. This petition
                    was signed by several hundred people.</p>
                <p>Ryan decided that he was coming, willy nilly. If he couldn't visit Jonestown so
                    be it, but he was going to come to Guyana and try. At the same time we hadn't
                    been up to Jonestown for longer than our usual period because for a number of
                    weeks the landing strip was, according the civil aviation people, in bad
                    condition and it was chancy because of the rains. We had been given numerous
                    excuses by the People's Temple. Jim Jones was sick and was running a high fever
                    and was in no condition to receive anybody. And this illness of Jim Jones' was
                    an allegation that had been made for several months. Whether or not he was
                    actually ill, whether he was, as some reports have it and probably accurately,
                    abusing narcotics of some kind, or what have you, I don't know. I don't think we
                    will ever know. The examination of the body after his death I don't think was
                    conclusive on this, but it was intimated to us that he had cancer and was
                    dying.</p>
                <p>In any event the new consul finally got up there. We had asked McCoy to prolong
                    his stay in Guyana and for the new consul to get there earlier so that McCoy
                    could take him up. McCoy did show him around, but unfortunately we couldn't
                    arrange the trip. The new consul went up shortly after McCoy left with another
                    consular officer. He had never met Jones before. He came back and said Jones did
                    indeed look sick and slurred his words, etc. Certainly his impression of Jones'
                    health was different from my own when he looked like a healthy man to me. Jones
                    had very, very black hair and there was a question as to whether it was dyed or
                    not, and he continually wore dark glasses, giving him a rather unusual look. He
                    was distinctive looking which I am sure he strived for.</p>
                <p>Anyway, the new consul came back and his report on his visit did not, except for
                    Jones' possible illness, differ materially from the reports of the previous
                    consul. He had interviewed people; everybody said they were happy; nobody wanted
                    to come back; he had interviewed them privately. He did, as the consular officer
                    always did after such a visit, write the parents of these children or the
                    relatives or whoever inquired. Of course, we had to get a release from these
                    people to talk about them despite the fact that this might be somebody's son up
                    there, and if he didn't wish to communicate with his parents there was nothing
                    the United States government could do to make him do so. As a matter of fact we
                    were distinctly forbidden to comment on his state of health or well being or
                    anything else until we had a release from him. So we always asked the guy to
                    sign a release, which they almost always did.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>Ellis came back and, as the Consul did, he wrote up his reports on these people.
                    However, other things caused some delay. Ironically, some of the people did not
                    receive the letters saying that their relatives and children were in good health
                    and happy until after the death notice of their children and relatives.</p>
                <p>In the meanwhile Embassy Guyana was trying to figure out what the hell was coming
                    off with Congressman Ryan— when he was coming, who would accompany him. When he
                    decided that he would come, Jones and the People's Temple said they wanted him
                    to be there at the same time as their two lawyers. One was Gary from California
                    who has been a long time supporter of radical causes in California and had been
                    the People's Temple lawyer for some years. He was an elderly man, white hair,
                    not all of it his own, but carefully glued in place, and I suspect he was very
                    much a sincere 1930s type radical lawyer.</p>
                <p>The other lawyer that Jones wanted present had newly come to the People's Temple
                    cause. This was a man named Mark Lane. He had written a book about the
                    assassination of President Kennedy. He had been active in conspiracy causes and
                    anything that made a great deal of publicity. He had come down to Guyana in the
                    summer and visited Jonestown for the first time. After he came back from
                    Jonestown to Georgetown, one of the People's Temple persons called me up and
                    said that Mark Lane would like to meet me. I said, “Fine.” Frankly I was vaguely
                    aware that Mark Lane had a name somewhat better known, but I didn't really know
                    who he was, but was happy to meet with him. They wanted to meet at a certain
                    time the next day which was inconvenient for me. They couldn't meet any other
                    time so I rearranged my schedule. In the meantime Lane had given a press
                    conference in Georgetown implying, or perhaps actually stating, that the
                    People's Temple were a bunch of dedicated, sincere, wonderful people who were
                    being harassed by the United States government, including the CIA and the State
                    Department. In other words another conspiracy.</p>
                <p>Our public affairs officer at the Embassy attended the press conference, took
                    notes and indeed it was recorded and is still around somewhere. [This part is a
                    little more clear in my mind because I was asked two weeks ago to appear in a TV
                    program with Mark Lane and I said no.] Lane said he had never seen such a
                    wonderful community, it was progressing marvelously well, it was a paradise on
                    earth—said Mark Lane two months before the Jonestown tragedy.</p>
                <p>He didn't keep his appointment with me. I called the People's Temple up and asked
                    what happened, was he coming over. They said, no, that Mr. Lane had decided not
                    to because he does not think that the Embassy would hear what he has to say in
                    an impartial fashion. I said, okay, and by happenstance I had a luncheon at the
                    hotel where Lane was staying that day and went down there and saw the People's
                    Temple representative with someone else and went up to him and said that I would
                    be happy to reschedule the meeting if you need to do it. He said, “No, no, we
                    don't see any purpose in this.” I said, “Okay.” Meanwhile this other fellow was
                    standing there and he said, “By the way this is Mark Lane.” I said, “How do you
                    do?” He nodded without exchanging a word. So I left.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>We then went back to the planning. By this time the congressman was coming; Jim
                    Jones wanted Lane to come back to Guyana; Lane said he couldn't come when the
                    congressman could come; Gary had some scheduling problems; and finally
                    Congressman Ryan said, “The hell with it, I'm coming and if you want your
                    lawyers there you get them there.”</p>
                <p>In the interval the Foreign Minister of Guyana, Horashly Jackson, told Ambassador
                    Burke in a conversation regarding Congressman Ryan's visit that the government
                    of Guyana had no objection to the visit by Congressman Ryan and that they
                    considered it a private visit. Congressman Ryan and the Embassy was to
                    understand, however, that whether the People's Temple wanted to receive
                    Congressman Ryan was completely up to the People's Temple and the individuals
                    therein. As far as the government of Guyana was concerned, Jonestown was the
                    home of these people and they would not permit anybody to force their way
                    in.</p>
                <p>By this time the idea of the psychiatrist and other staff members had somehow
                    gone by the board. The Embassy was expecting a visit by Congressman Ryan, his
                    legislative aide and a committee staffer. While talking to the manager of a
                    hotel we learned that there was a whole bunch of reservations for the press. I
                    personally called the acting director of Caribbean Affairs and asked if it was
                    true that a whole bunch of press people were coming down. Obviously this is a
                    small town with limited communications and there would be a lot of things we
                    would have to do if we were going to get a lot of people. I was told flat out
                    that no press would accompany Congressman Ryan. It might be that some press
                    might come down on their own, but no “press” would accompany him.</p>
                <p>When Ryan arrived and all the press got off the plane without visas I turned to
                    the Ambassador and said, “I wonder what the hell they mean by not accompanying
                    Ryan.” We not only had press, we had NBC television crew, we had the Washington
                    Post, we had the Hearst newspapers and a whole flock of people. And a whole
                    flock of people with the usual arrogance of the American press or media who
                    decided that the laws of this small country didn't really apply to the American
                    press, therefore, they didn't need visas. They should be issued visas at the
                    border. Currency controls didn't apply to them either. They could walk into the
                    country with Guyanese currency that they bought at a discount, etc.
                    Unfortunately, at the airport there was myself, the Ambassador and the
                    administrative officer and, I guess, a consular officer with a couple of
                    drivers. We didn't have the press guy there. We obviously should have, but it
                    was 12:30 at night... Anyway, it was a real show. They refused to let some of
                    these guys in. Others refused to enter the country if their friends were not
                    allowed in. Others refused to leave their camera equipment in customs; of
                    course, customs had long since closed. I am still irritated about it because
                    these were all things that the Embassy could have solved had this jerk back in
                    the Department been on his toes—he was our own jerk, he was not Consular
                    Affairs, he was the Desk Officer. Consular Affairs, also could have told us,
                    somebody could have told us. Anyway I was in no mood for the niceties.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>We had also told the Department we have got a problem. What is it that we can
                    tell the congressman about these people up there in view of the Privacy Act?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might add that the Privacy Act was fairly new and
                        everybody was very sensitive about this at this time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: We had to request special permission to record terrorist threats—nobody
                    had taken into account about recording telephone conversations.</p>
                <p>We were adamant. We wanted to cooperate with this guy but we wanted to know what
                    we could tell him. What's more we wanted it in writing. It was like pulling
                    teeth, but we finally got something out of them giving us some guidelines.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say other departments, where was the problem
                        coming from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: God only knows. Consular Affairs or Legal Affairs. Basically what we were
                    asking was what can we discuss with this man without infringing on the privacy
                    of American citizens about whom we have been warned. I should also say that the
                    People's Temple had a considerable effort there using the Information Act to
                    obtain most everything that we sent back to Washington. They were continuously
                    raising suits, not only the People's Temple but the parent. So basically we
                    were...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Working in a fish bowl.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Yes, whatever we were writing we knew was going to come to the attention
                    of all of these groups, except what was protected under the Privacy Act or
                    something else. And I must say, the Embassy had no ax to grind whatsoever. All
                    we wanted to know was what legally we were responsible for because otherwise we
                    felt we would have legal problems about talking about things that were the
                    private concerns and professional aspects of it.</p>
                <p>Leo Ryan rode in the car with the Ambassador and I took his staffer and his
                    legislative assistant along. His legislative assistant was not there as a formal
                    member of the delegation. Her trip was supposedly paid for my the congressman,
                    himself. She was there as his personal aide and not as a member of the
                    congressional delegation nor as a member of the congressional staff.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>I made, what I can only profess to be a faux pas, going back in the car because I
                    said to the congressional staffer, the former Foreign Service Officer whom I had
                    known in his previous existence—we were talking about how we were going to get
                    up to Jonestown. I was telling him that this was not easily done. You know you
                    want to go to Jonestown but you don't know when you want to go. We have to get
                    an airplane from somebody. They are not that frequent down here. We tried to
                    reserve the sugar cooperation's twin Cherokee for three days but that is out of
                    the country being repaired. The only other decent twins around are elsewhere.
                    First of all we have to have funds from the delegation if you want us to reserve
                    an airplane. In essence what I was saying to him was, “In God's sake why didn't
                    you plan this thing out a little better so we could have had all these things
                    and the press in line.” Well the congressional staffer was a bit of an
                    non-entity because I soon found myself attacked with great vehemence on the
                    flank by Ryan's legislative aide. This young lady was also a lawyer and it
                    suddenly became very clear to me that my old acquaintance had nothing to do with
                    this whatsoever. The powers to be were seating on my left.</p>
                <p>Then we got into what we could tell the delegation. I said we were concerned
                    about this—we had this directive from Washington. She said they would come and
                    have a meeting with me in the morning. So they had a meeting with me in the
                    morning and she said, “This is not my understanding of what we would be told by
                    the Embassy from what the Consular Affairs told me.” I said, “Well, I don't
                    know. I asked them what they told you and they said this is what they told you.”
                    She said, “Well, in effect, I don't think that is accurate any longer.” I said,
                    “Fine, draft something and I will be glad to send it back to the Department. If
                    they want to change it they will.” It was too bad because it was a faux pas on
                    my part because it was not an important question really. It turned out that they
                    knew a hell of a lot more about these people than we did. I kick myself for
                    adding a little friction...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One has to look at the time. There was a whole change in
                        government at that time. The whole idea of the privacy of the individual
                        plus the fact that everything that you did would be wide open. This was all
                        quite new and I think all of us were very aware of this and not feeling very
                        loose about it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Certainly the change in administrations didn't make a great deal of
                    difference, but the emphasis on the Privacy Act, the Freedom of Information, the
                    whole thing with secret recordings dating from Watergate, to say nothing of the
                    anti-USA and everybody else, had made us more alert to such things possibly more
                    than we would have been before. But the irony was that in fact there was very
                    little that we could have told these people.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>So, the congressman was staying with Ambassador Burke at the residence; the other
                    members of his delegations were at the single decent hotel in town. Again there
                    is a little irony there. Ryan and Ambassador Burke grew up not far from each
                    other in Wisconsin. Both went to private Catholic day schools. Both had an Irish
                    Catholic background. Burke was and is a very private person—the last one I could
                    think of who would enjoy publicity of any kind, shape or form. Ryan was
                    completely opposite—hale fellow, flamboyant, at his happiest in that.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Burke had invited my wife and myself over for dinner with Congressman
                    Ryan the day following his arrival. We got over there to find Ryan talking with
                    a couple of people, at least one woman who had come down with him. I should say
                    that Ryan arrived not only with the press, but a whole bunch of People's Temple
                    relatives—I don't remember how many came down, 15 or 20 or so. He was anxious
                    for Ambassador Burke to talk with this one woman who could tell him about when
                    she knew Jim Jones in South America. Burke asked if she had any relatives in
                    Jonestown. No, she had no relatives in Jonestown. Her whole thing was that she
                    had known Jim Jones and came along because she felt it was her duty to do so.
                    But she had no ties and Ambassador Burke felt very strongly that while he would
                    gladly meet with relatives or parents or anybody he was not available to the
                    general public in what was a terribly sensitive situation.</p>
                <p>The lady finally went home and we had dinner with Ryan. Ryan told us about his
                    friend whose grandchildren were up there. We explained some of our problems with
                    people there. If in a private confidential conversation they say they are happy
                    there and don't want to leave, we have no way to force them to leave. The
                    American government has no way to take these children away from their mother in
                    Jonestown and send them back to California. You can't do that from the State of
                    New York, let alone Guyana. It would have to be, again, another legal case,
                    which is again a sorry and sad way to do it, but there is no other way.
                    Congressman Ryan said something to the effect that if they were my grandchildren
                    I would figure out a way to get them back. And, indeed, I think he would have.
                    The point being that he felt, I am sure, that the Embassy was paying too much
                    attention to the niceties. And indeed, from his viewpoint, I suppose we
                    were.</p>
                <p>In the course of the next couple of days, Ryan and the members of the relatives
                    who had come petitioned for agreement of the People's Temple to go up there to
                    Jonestown. One night Ryan went over to the People's Temple headquarters in
                    Georgetown and simply walked in unannounced. He said, “Hello, I'm the bad guy,”
                    and set forth his reasons for going to Jonestown and saying that he was not up
                    there to find anyone guilty of anything, but that his constituents were
                    complaining about a lack of response and he wanted to see what was happening to
                    a bunch of American citizens, some of whom were his constituents.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>A couple of days later we weren't much further along and Ryan said, “I'm going.
                    We are going tomorrow.” I said, “You are sure you are going?” And he said,
                    “Yep.” I was his control officer, incidentally, for the congressional visit—one,
                    because we wanted somebody older with what was a very sensitive situation, and
                    secondly, the natural selection for control officer would have been the consul
                    but this was a man who was going, we thought, to have to work with these people
                    subsequently in consular affairs and we didn't want to tar him with whatever
                    happened on this congressional investigation. I said to the congressional
                    staffer, “Okay, we will see if we can get an airplane.” Our administrative
                    officer was resourceful and he got the government of Guyana and Guyanese airways
                    to agreed to take a Guyanese airliner out of service for the day and give it to
                    the congressman. This was an Islander—a small two engine aircraft that flew to
                    the interior of Guyana on a more or less regular schedule. I think it sat 18
                    people. The aide was saying don't commit yourselves until the last moment
                    because we may have to cancel. I said, “Listen we are taking an airliner out of
                    service for the day, we have to pay for it, if we want it we have to say so
                    now.” Finally I went to the congressman and told him it would cost him a couple
                    thousand dollars if you want the airplane. He said, “Yes, get it.” He paid for
                    it out of congressional funds.</p>
                <p>Now he had an airplane with 17 or 18 seats on it and he sold seats to the press
                    and to a bunch of the relatives. So now we are going up to Jonestown not just
                    with the congressman and his aides (in fact we left the committee staffer, who
                    was the only other official member of the delegation back in Georgetown), but
                    the news people and half a dozen of the relatives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is October 2, 1990. This is the third of a set of
                        interviews with Richard Dwyer. Dick we just got you on the plane with Leo
                        Ryan. Who was on the plane?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Well, this was an Islander aircraft we rented from Guyanese Air company
                    and had about 17 or 18 seats. Because it was a bigger plane than we needed for
                    Congressman Ryan, he sold seats on the plane to the press people who had come
                    down with him. This included a TV crew from NBC, they must have had 4 or 5
                    people, I guess, and a reporters from the Washington Post, and from the Hearst
                    newspapers in San Francisco, and then there were a half dozen or so of relatives
                    of the people at Jonestown who had come down with Congressman Ryan as well, plus
                    Congressman Ryan's personal legislative assistant, Jackie Spears.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a woman or a man?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: A woman.</p>
                <p>The official delegation had consisted of Leo Ryan and a congressional staffer,
                    Jim Scholart, but Scholart stayed in Georgetown and the congressman's own staff
                    member, Jackie Spears, went up with him.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just one question before we move on. Did you get any
                        impression from the members of the press, both TV and the papers that they
                        were out for blood. That they were going to uncover some sort of a
                        scandal—were they going to be aggressively looking for dirt?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Hard to say. Where they all came from I am not absolutely sure. The
                    newspaper people from San Francisco had been people familiar with the People's
                    Temple for a number of years. This had been a continuing story there and so they
                    were fairly knowledgeable and had a good idea of the organization and the
                    background of it. I don't really know where the NBC TV crew came from.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In their questions to you did you get a feel that they
                        were out for blood or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Not terribly. They certainly were nothing like what would hit us in a few
                    days time. Then we had an incredible crew of unscrupulous and less then
                    desirable media with the usual good ones, of course. But I think they were
                    looking for a story and this was something exotic. To what extent Congressman
                    Ryan and his office encouraged them to go along I don't know. He may have
                    considered (purely speculation on my part) that a larger group of people were
                    valuable not only for the publicity but perhaps to make the group more secure or
                    safety conscious. We learned later that these people were very concerned about
                    the visit up there.</p>
                <p>Those on the plane also included the People's Temple two lawyers, Mark Lane and
                    Gary.</p>
                <p>There were many more relatives who had come down—relatives of people who were up
                    there and some people who were not relatives but had been former People's Temple
                    members or something who had come to Guyana with Leo Ryan. These relatives had
                    apparently chosen representatives amongst themselves. Among those relatives we
                    had a mother whose two sons were there; a brother of Maria's—a principal aid of
                    Jones who had accused her father of molestation when he had traveled to Guyana
                    before; a fellow from the National Enquirer, with everything that implied—as a
                    matter of fact I think he had been to Guyana earlier and had appeared at our
                    Embassy requesting help because his visa had expired and he wanted us to extend
                    it, but we discovered that he was a British citizen and not an American so we
                    sent him over to the British Embassy. That was the crew.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>We left in the early afternoon. I was continually concerned about the time we
                    were leaving because I knew that it would be very difficult, if not impossible,
                    to get up there, take the 1 � hour flight, and then probably 45 minutes over to
                    the People's Temple, presuming transportation was there for us, and then to get
                    back and out before dark. Dark comes in the tropics regularly all year long
                    about 6:00 or so. The airline crew was subject to strict rules as to when they
                    could take off. We had intended to leave in the morning, but negotiations were
                    still continuing with the lawyers who said they did not want to go then, they
                    wanted to go later or some other time. Finally Ryan said he was going and they
                    could come if they wanted to come. Which they did. So, by the time we got out of
                    there it was early afternoon.</p>
                <p>As we flew up there the pilot called me up to the cockpit and said he had gotten
                    word that the landing strip was unsafe to land on. This had been passed from
                    someone in Port Kaituma to someone in Georgetown to the civil aviation
                    authority. He tended to think that this might not be true so we made a couple
                    passes at the airstrip once we got up there. This was just a little hard tarmac
                    out in the middle of a clear place in the bush near the little village of Port
                    Kaituma. We saw nothing there that indicated we couldn't land, so we landed.</p>
                <p>We were met at the airstrip by a local government representative and a group of
                    people from the People's Temple. The group of people from the People's Temple
                    were unfriendly, to say the least. They had been usually careful to observe
                    polite proprieties before hand, certainly with me and with other people from the
                    Embassy, but there was a feeling this time that those things were lacking. They
                    told the congressman that he was really not very welcome; this was an
                    inconvenient time; that Jim Jones was not well, etc., etc.</p>
                <p>The delegation from the People's Temple in a large truck, open ended dump truck,
                    decided to go with the lawyers back to the People's Temple and discuss it
                    further, I guess, with Jim Jones. Congressman Ryan began an informal press
                    conference with the press saying that he was here and wanted to visit the
                    People's Temple but this apparently would not be allowed. The government
                    representative had said that it was up to the People's Temple as to whether they
                    wanted to receive visitors or not. Anyway as he was beginning this little
                    informal meeting with the press, the dump truck had come back. The people in the
                    truck said that they had decided that they would take Congressman Ryan and
                    myself and his aid and a government representative from the Ministry of
                    Information, a press type fellow, back to the People's Temple, but that they
                    would not take the press or the relatives.</p>
                <p>Congressman Ryan told the relatives and the press that he would see what he could
                    do about getting them to visit the People's Temple once he got there. So we
                    drove out in the back of this dump truck. There still was a discussion going on
                    principally between Mark Lane and the People's Temple representative about
                    whether they should admit these visitors or not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did Mark Lane come down? Was he arguing to let the
                        people in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>DWYER: Yes, he was and I think Gary was too. As a matter of fact I remember Mr.
                    Lane's comments verbatim which was, “I would let them all in except maybe that
                    prick from the State Department”—namely, me.</p>
                <p>We arrived and were met by Marcy Jones, Jim Jones' wife, and warmly welcomed. We
                    went over to the open walled pavilion which was the principal meeting place of
                    the community and Marcy said that Jim Jones would be with us shortly. She said
                    first of all that she would like to show the group around the community. It was
                    an attempt to repeat the same kind of walk through of the community that they
                    had provided me when I had been there previously in the spring. We walked
                    through the school and, perhaps, the dispensary, and spent some time in Marcy's
                    own project, the infant care facilities. Finally Congressman Ryan said, “This
                    was all very interesting but my main purpose to visit here is to talk privately
                    with members of your community about whom a number of my constituents are
                    concerned.”</p>
                <p>With that we went back to the pavilion and their band was playing, they told us,
                    in rehearsal for their second annual show that they were going to present in
                    Georgetown. They had quite a bit of talent there that had the previous year in
                    Georgetown been very warmly welcomed. There was a jazz band or rock band, a
                    couple of vocalists of the quality that were hardly topnotch professional but
                    were certainly impressive in Georgetown. Anyway this group was playing.</p>
                <p>Congressman Ryan divided up a list of names between himself and his legislative
                    assistant, Jackie Spears, about whom they had heard or had inquiries about.
                    Later, well after the fact, I learned that they had prepared themselves very
                    carefully. They had prepared flash cards that they could show the people they
                    were interviewing that said if you want to leave nod you head, and things like
                    that because they were concerned about, or thought the people they were
                    interviewing might be concerned about recordings or something like that which,
                    in fact, I don't think entered into the case. But they were prepared for
                    that.</p>
                <p>Marcy Jones agreed to call these people and have them interviewed, but it may
                    take a little time because some of them may be working in the fields or
                    something. Congressman Ryan said that would be fine.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>They began the interviews. Interestingly enough, the first interview that
                    Congressman Ryan did was with a young man whose mother had been terribly
                    concerned about him and had been writing the Embassy for some time. He happened
                    to be one of the members of the band, so Congressman Ryan took him aside and
                    talked with him for 10 minutes or so. He came back and while waiting for the
                    next person I asked Congressman Ryan how his interview went. He said, “Well, it
                    was a little strange. He said he was very happy here and wanted to stay here. He
                    didn't particularly want to see his mother. I said she was in Georgetown and had
                    come a long way and why would he not let her come up to see him? He said if she
                    wanted to he could not stop her but it was up to her.” Congressman Ryan was
                    obviously concerned about the interview and asked me to go talk to the boy as
                    well. Which I did with largely the same results. The hierarchy of the People's
                    Temple maintain that the boy's mother was upset because he had married a black
                    girl and there were racial overtones, etc., etc. Whether there were or not, I
                    have no idea. But the fact was that the boy spoke to us as he had spoken in the
                    past and to Congressman Ryan. The concern of the Congressman that previous
                    interviews had not been sufficiently private, that people may have been
                    concerned about being recorded or something with the result that they took
                    precautions, such as the flash cards, made little difference.</p>
                <p>Jim Jones came out eventually. Congressman Ryan and he talked for a while. Ryan
                    explained that he was on an official delegation, that he had no ax to grind,
                    that he wanted to see for himself so that he could report to his constituents.
                    Jim Jones gave his usual spiel that these were people who had been emotionally
                    and economically deprived in the United States and the whole purpose of this
                    wilderness settlement was to remove them from the temptation of the large city.
                    Although he said at one point that if he had to do it over again maybe he would
                    not remove them quite so far. The People's Temple were the victims of malicious
                    and untrue propaganda put out by the concerned relatives. Ryan pressed for the
                    admittance of the press and the concerned relatives and with the support of the
                    two lawyers Jim Jones reluctantly agreed that everyone could come in with the
                    exception of the fellow from the National Enquirer.</p>
                <p>There was a story behind the National Enquirer thing, which I won't bother you
                    with now but it was typically unsavory. An article had been written and then it
                    had been suppressed and there may have been money changing hands for the
                    suppression of the article. Anyway he was the one fellow that Jones was adamant
                    about not coming in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The meeting between Ryan and Jones was not heated
                        or...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>DWYER: No, no. Both men were highly sophisticated dealing with public figures.
                    Jones, himself, had been county commissioner for housing in Los Angeles and he
                    had in the days of the People's Temple heyday in Los Angeles been apparently a
                    player of at least minor importance, perhaps more than that, in the local
                    political scene, if only because he could produce at any time several hundred
                    people for rallies, demonstrations and speeches and the People's Temple had been
                    a contributor to worthy causes, etc. So there was no great problem there.</p>
                <p>The interviews went on with Congressman Ryan and Jackie Spears. The press arrived
                    pretty close to dusk. I had told the pilot of the airplane to make sure he was
                    back by dusk, but I don't remember now whether he just stayed or what have you,
                    but my last instructions were to be here in the morning if you can't stay here
                    overnight.</p>
                <p>It was obvious that we were not going to get out that night. I had anticipated
                    this and had put a change of clothes in my briefcase along with appropriate
                    toilet articles so I was reasonably prepared. With the arrival of the press they
                    fanned out through the group. Walked around and talked to people. Marcy Jones
                    got up and announced on the loudspeaker to the group as a whole that they were
                    free to talk to the press as they wished but one did not have to do so if one
                    did not wish to do so. She was concerned that the television lights might bother
                    some of the older and younger people. The crew agreed that if anyone looked
                    uncomfortable with the lights on them they would turn them off.</p>
                <p>We all had dinner in the pavilion with the group. After dinner there was a show
                    put on for our benefit. It was part of the show that was to be presented in
                    Georgetown towards Christmas. At the conclusion of the show which was singing a
                    monologue comedy thing by an older woman with an enthusiastic audience, Marcy
                    Jones got up and asked the Congressman if he would care to say a few words about
                    why he was here. Ryan got up and said to the group what he had previously told
                    Jones and the lawyers that he was there on an official congressional visit; that
                    he had no ax to grind; that he wanted to report on the facts so that there would
                    be no doubt as to the true situation of these people in San Francisco. He added
                    that he had been talking to people individually and he had found a number of
                    people who thought this place was the greatest place on earth. There was
                    certainly a great deal of enthusiasm for the community amongst some of the
                    People's Temple members he had talked with. He got an ovation that lasted a
                    couple of minutes. He concluded by saying that his only real regret was that
                    these people were not back in San Francisco to vote for him. And someone called
                    out, perhaps it was Jim Jones, “Don't worry we can vote by proxy.”</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>With that the Congressman continued his interviews along with Jackie Spears. All
                    the relatives had been talking with their own relatives and pictures were being
                    taken. Then there was a suggestion that the plane that was to come up in the
                    morning would bring more relatives on it. I was concerned, very much, about
                    this. I counseled that this not be done because we were an official delegation
                    on official business. We were not in the tourist business. There was nothing to
                    prevent concerned relatives, if they so wished, from chartering their own
                    aircraft and coming up. But I could see all kinds of problems if the congressman
                    were to somehow be held responsible for an aircraft accident or something—or the
                    State Department. I felt personally and strongly that we had enough on our plate
                    without adding another dozen relatives.</p>
                <p>The press very much wanted to stay in Jonestown overnight. The Jonestown people
                    said they simply didn't have room for all this large group. They would put up
                    myself, the guy from the Ministry of Information, the congressman and his aide,
                    but the others would have to go back to Port Kaituma and find whatever
                    accommodations they could.</p>
                <p>The NBC TV crew had arranged for a lengthy interview with Jones the next day and
                    said to Congressman Ryan and myself that it would be a hard hitting interview.
                    We arranged that that would be the last thing on our schedule. We would depart
                    immediately after, presuming we had airplanes.</p>
                <p>The People's Temple had shortwave radio communication with Georgetown. They were
                    keeping their contacts in Georgetown well informed as to what was going on. I
                    used the shortwave radio to talk with an Embassy consular officer who was at the
                    People's Temple headquarters in Georgetown.</p>
                <p>Towards the end of the evening when the press were about to go back and the
                    interviews were continuing, a young man approached one of the NBC TV people and
                    passed him a note which said he wanted to leave but was afraid to be seen
                    talking to him. At about the same time, and I am still not sure of the sequence
                    of events, this young man approached me and said he wanted to leave, and he
                    wanted to leave right away that night. There was a girl that wanted to leave
                    with him. I told him there was nothing I could do for him that night as I was
                    not leaving myself. But to stay close to me and I would see that he left with me
                    when I left in the morning. And the girl with him. The guy from NBC and myself
                    and Ryan then talked about it and what was interesting to me, at least, was that
                    of all the people Congressman Ryan had thus far spoken to and his aide, Jackie
                    Spears, none of them had expressed a desire to leave. Nor did any of the
                    relatives of the people who had come from California. This young man was someone
                    we had never heard of before—nor was the young woman. We talked about what to do
                    about it and decided that we would not tell the People's Temple hierarchy
                    anything about this until it was close to the time to leave.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>In the meantime, I had been on the radio and I realized that we had at least two
                    more people going back than coming. Congressman Ryan and I had told the press
                    and indeed the concerned relatives, but principally the press, that while they
                    were welcomed to come up there on a “space available” basis there was no
                    guarantee that they would get a ride home. Obviously I was concerned about
                    everybody leaving who had to and also concerned that somebody else might want to
                    leave. So I was in the uncomfortable position of broadcasting on the open air
                    with the People's Temple standing around me. I told Embassy Georgetown to try to
                    find another plane.</p>
                <p>Anyway I hoped I got the word across that we needed another airplane which was
                    puzzling to Georgetown, I am sure, or at least to the People's Temple people in
                    Georgetown.</p>
                <p>I had been talking with all kinds of People's Temple members in the course of the
                    evening and nothing very noteworthy do I recall. We talked about how the farm
                    was coming along, how the piggery was doing, and the problem that they had with
                    what is known in Guyana as tigers bothering their young cattle (tigers are the
                    pumas). In any event we called it a night around 11:00 or so, which certainly
                    was late for the People's Temple, I am sure that they normally went to bed a
                    little earlier on a dawn to dusk kind of community.</p>
                <p>Congressman Ryan and his aide were given quarters in the guest cottages. The
                    fellow from the Ministry of Information and I were housed in a little cabin. I
                    learned later it was Marcy Jones' own cabin. So we went to bed. The poor fellow
                    from the Ministry of Information was very unhappy about being there. He didn't
                    like the bush, it was his first time, etc. It was an uneventful night. We
                    listened to the BBC news and then the Voice of America and then went to
                    sleep.</p>
                <p>In the morning there was a knock on the door. Someone brought us breakfast of
                    pancakes, syrup and bacon which was amusing because my colleague, who was a
                    black guy, not an East Indian, had never encountered pancakes before. We had a
                    big discussion on how they should be eaten. The fact that you put syrup on them
                    and eat them with a knife and fork was wrong. He knew Indian bread when he saw
                    it and you roll it up and eat it.</p>
                <p>We walked back down to the pavilion where Congressman Ryan and his aide were
                    having breakfast with the members of the community. Jackie Spears was concerned
                    that people were not being well fed, or something. Whether or not that was true
                    they certainly were on a lean diet, I am sure, a lot of the time and a
                    monotonous one, but they were smart enough to make sure that everybody ate well
                    while we were there.</p>
                <p>The interviews continued—I should have gone back and reviewed stuff because my
                    sequence of events is foggy in my own mind—and the film crew was taking pictures
                    all over.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They came back from...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Oh yes, the reporters came back. They came back with stories that they had
                    picked up from, I believe, the part time militia man—he had a khaki shirt and a
                    pair of shorts and a shotgun and he was law and order as far as Port Kaituma was
                    concerned. The reporters said that he had told them that there had been
                    automatic weapons smuggled into Jonestown and certainly some members of the
                    press were uneasy about their security and some of the stories they had been
                    told.</p>
                <p>The interview with Jones was scheduled towards the end. In the course of the
                    morning an elderly lady announced—I don't know who she told, whether it was me
                    or Jackie Spears or Congressman Ryan—that she wanted to go home and that a
                    grandchild wanted to go with her along with the grandchild's boyfriend. So now
                    we had these three plus the two that had spoken to me and the NBC people last
                    night. And then there were a number of others of this same large family group. I
                    should say that ties among the people at Jonestown were terribly confusing to me
                    and I imagine to most other people. Marriages had been made and dissolved. There
                    were relationships that came and went. And who was related to whom was terribly
                    difficult to figure out. But in essence the family of the grandmother that
                    wanted to come home then had two or three children who were the children of the
                    elderly lady's son or daughter. Anyway the Parks family. What I found
                    interesting was that these were people who had been with Jim Jones for years,
                    and indeed, some of them had come from Indiana with him out to California.</p>
                <p>By this time we had half a dozen or so, I guess. The two from the evening before,
                    the Parks family—the Parks family couldn't make up their mind as to whether they
                    wanted to go or not—the son who was the elderly woman's grandson was a medical
                    therapist, the articulate spokesman for the family, but his mother seemed
                    reluctant to leave. His father said well, I don't want to stay here for the rest
                    of my life but I don't want to leave like this. In any event, this agonizing
                    discussion with the family went on for some time. Finally they all decided to
                    go. They were concerned about getting their personal effects. Jackie Spears went
                    with a couple of them back to their dormitories where they lived to gather their
                    personal effects.</p>
                <p>I guess by this time we must have collected a few others, but I would say that we
                    had a total of about 11 or 12, I would guess. It became time to tell Jim Jones
                    about this. He was visibly upset by it. He wanted to talk with the relatives.
                    Jackie Spears was reluctant to let them do so. I said, I didn't see how we could
                    stop him from doing so if he wishes. They talked to him and they remained firm
                    in their decision to leave. There were hugs and kisses all the way around and
                    Jones instructed someone to go get money to pay their way back and somebody came
                    up with a whole bunch of Guyanese currency and threshed it into my hand—I wish I
                    had kept it, but I didn't. I said to give it to the lawyers or to the people. We
                    are leaving. I never did find out what happened to that particular stack of
                    money.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>In any event, I was back on the radio saying that we had to have this extra
                    plane, etc. All the time trying to avoid specific reason for the need knowing
                    the People's Temple people would be listening.</p>
                <p>The NBC television crew had their interview with Jim Jones. It was
                    confrontational to some extent. Jones certainly did not appear as healthy as he
                    had appeared to me the previous spring. He had what it seemed like full control
                    of his faculties. He trotted out the little boy about who the custody suit had
                    been about, maintaining that anyone could see that this child, who was 4 or 5,
                    was a replica of Jim Jones, and to some extent the child did look like Jim
                    Jones—whether or not he was Jim Jones child, I suppose we will never know. But
                    in any event at the conclusion of the television interview we were sitting
                    around— I should say that there had been a meeting with the lawyers, with
                    Congressional Ryan and Jim Jones and some of his lieutenants. The thrust of the
                    statements of Congressman Ryan and indeed of the lawyers, was that 11 people out
                    of a thousand want to go home. This was not a catastrophe. Jones was obviously
                    upset, he considered that this was the unraveling of everything for him.
                    Although that was not as apparent as it would later become.</p>
                <p>The big dump truck was pulled up and the concerned relatives who were leaving
                    began to load their things on it. The mass of People's Temple members stood
                    around quietly and watched. There were some exchanges. Then a man came up with,
                    I think two children, and said that he wanted to come too and take the children.
                    A woman followed him screaming saying, “You can't take my children. My children
                    and I stay here.” We had the most difficult problem of a consular officer's life
                    of a custody question right there.</p>
                <p>By this time I knew we had a small single engine aircraft coming up that would
                    carry 4 people. We were going over our space. Most of the press would have to
                    stay off. The lawyers, I had no compunction about leaving, mainly because they
                    were contained by the People's Temple. Even so, I wanted to get as many people
                    out of there as possible.</p>
                <p>With this couple coming we told them that whether the man was coming with the
                    children or without the children was not something that we could decide. This
                    was a legal question that we had no authority to determine. But it looked like,
                    although we didn't have any more people wanting to go, with the exception of a
                    young man who came very late who said he wanted to go, it looked conceivably
                    that we might have some more if we talked to people.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>Congressman Ryan and I talked about it. We decided that we would stay—in fact he
                    decided he would stay and if he stayed, I stayed—over night again. The people
                    who were leaving would go. I said I would take all those who were leaving to the
                    airport and then return with the truck. We had everybody pretty much loaded up
                    on the truck. I had given Marcy Jones my briefcase to hold for me—the only thing
                    of value in it was a fairly expensive short wave radio. We were all on the
                    truck. We were told by the driver that it appeared to be stuck in the mud.
                    Whether it was actually stuck or a device to delay our departure I don't know. I
                    suspect it was the latter while the People's Temple leaders were meeting to see
                    what they decided they wanted to do about it.</p>
                <p>Anyway, we were all on the truck when suddenly there came—the congressman was
                    back in the pavilion—shouts and screams from the pavilion. I got off the truck
                    and ran back to the pavilion. A couple of the large young men who were the
                    security force for the People's Temple would not let the press or anyone else,
                    besides my self—I guess they let one press guy go back. We arrived at the
                    pavilion to find Congressman Ryan standing shaken with blood all over his shirt
                    and another young man being held by members of the People's Temple. What had
                    happened apparently was that this young man had approached Ryan from behind with
                    a knife, grabbed him from the back and put the knife to his throat and said that
                    he was going to kill him. A couple of the People's Temple members and one of the
                    lawyers grabbed the guy and wrestled him to the ground. In the process the young
                    man's hand was cut and be bled all over Ryan's shirt.</p>
                <p>Ryan said that the young man had to be put in custody and the police have to be
                    notified. The only real police were at Matthew's Ridge, an old mining town about
                    30 miles away, except for the guy in shorts with a shotgun in town. He was
                    assured that this would be done and that he would be prosecuted under Guyanese
                    law and that they would call the police right away—of course, they had no means
                    of calling the police. Congressman Ryan was shaken obviously but still very much
                    in command of himself. He and I walked aside and he asked what do we do now. I
                    said, “Congressman I am not sure what I'm doing, but I want you out of here
                    right now as fast as we can.” He said, “Will you stay and see about the people
                    who want to come back?” And I said, “Yes, I would.” Looking back at it I shudder
                    to think about it.</p>
                <p>But in any event, my main concern was getting him out of there.</p>
                <p>Jones was terribly, terribly upset. If he had been upset before when a few people
                    were leaving, now with the attack on the congressman he was doubly upset. We all
                    got in the truck. Congressman Ryan was up in the cab and the rest of us were in
                    the bed of the truck. I don't remember where Jackie Spears was. We took off.
                    Dale Parks, the young man who I mentioned before as the medical therapist and
                    the spokesman for the Parks family who wanted to leave, approached me and some
                    others of the newsmen and the congressman's party. He said that the young man
                    who had gotten on the truck—a small man with a long raincoat—was Larry Layton.
                    He was certain that Larry Layton was not a true defector. Larry Layton was one
                    of the most dedicated members of Jones' hierarchy and he was sure that Layton
                    was a plant.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>We drove to the gate of the People's Temple—there was a dirt road that may be
                    about a mile and a half from the center part of the community to the edge of the
                    property where it joined the state road. [I should have added that there was an
                    incident the day before of a tractor filled with logs that was supposedly broken
                    down across the path of the road coming into People's Temple which delayed our
                    entry there. I don't know whether it was a real accident or not, but it had been
                    another unsettling thing.] As we were going out Dale Parks' father, the guy who
                    said he didn't want to spend the rest of his life there but didn't want to leave
                    under those circumstances, was adamant that he wanted to go back to the piggery
                    of which he was in charge to collect his personal belongings. I said, “No way.”
                    Later I learned that he wanted to go back for a revolver that they kept there to
                    kill the hogs with and perhaps some money, I don't know.</p>
                <p>At the gate we stopped and a couple of the security guards got into the back of
                    the truck—real mean looking bastards—and carefully looked at everybody. Someone
                    from the people who were leaving with us said that one guy was looking for his
                    wife who he thought was leaving. I didn't know than and didn't learn for some
                    time that in addition—I don't think any of us knew, Ryan, or Spears, the press
                    or myself—in the course of the night apparently a lot of people had left the
                    People's Temple. They had just walked away and were headed for Port Kaituma or
                    Matthew's Ridge. I don't recall if I ever saw a figure of how many actually did,
                    but there were a sizeable number. This obviously was a factor...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we are not just talking about a normal small number of
                        people getting tired of where they were, but we are talking about the whole
                        thing beginning to unravel.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Well, our concern at the Embassy had always been that the thing was going
                    to unravel as a number of others had before it and that we were going to have a
                    thousand people who wanted to go home. As a matter of fact, People's Temple had
                    insinuated one of their more attractive young girls as a mistress to the
                    Guyanese Ambassador to the United States and he was very free with his
                    conversations with her. After this thing was all over and after some of the
                    documents were being shifted, I found memoranda of conversation between the
                    Guyanese Ambassador and myself, as Charg� d'Affaires, concerning the People's
                    Temple that had been written by this guy's mistress and sent up to Jones.
                    Interestingly enough, they were accurate. Jones had a system where not one
                    person wrote a report, but three people wrote a report on the same thing so that
                    he had three different versions of it and none of these reports were to be shown
                    to the other two people.</p>
                <p>We proceeded from the gate of the People's Temple through the little village of
                    Port Kaituma to the airstrip. No airplanes. While we all stood around on the
                    tarmac, I told Congressman Ryan that I had been warned about Larry Layton and
                    that we wanted to be sure that we body searched every member of the group that
                    was leaving with us for weapons or things like that. He agreed fully. Although
                    in Larry Layton's case they missed it.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>I then asked the driver of the big truck to drive me back the half mile to Port
                    Kaituma. I wanted to get to a radio. They had a radio telephone there but as
                    often is the case it was not working. I informed the government representative
                    there, a young man who was a career government officer who had been left to cool
                    his heels up in the boonies for ages. At first I couldn't find him, it was a
                    Saturday afternoon, but being experienced in the ways of the foreign service in
                    small countries, I found him in the grog shop, where everybody was having a few
                    rums. He quite rightly was concerned about it. He told me the telephone was out,
                    but he rounded up his man with the shotgun. As we were walking out of the grog
                    shop the first airplane came over. Much to my surprise the truck that had driven
                    me to town headed back to the airport leaving me there. The government
                    representative found a guy in the grog shop who was in from the bush with his
                    young son. He was pretty much 3 sheets to the wind by this time, but he had a
                    truck. We borrowed the truck, got the man with the shotgun, myself and some
                    other guy who I never did figure out who he was, and all drove back to the
                    airport.</p>
                <p>There were two airplanes on the ground—the Islander, the larger aircraft, was
                    about a quarter of the way down the tarmac, the little airplane was behind it.
                    The loading of the aircraft was going on. People were being searched as they got
                    on the aircraft. I talked with Ryan telling him that I would be going back to
                    People's Temple as agreed but that I wanted him out of there. I shook hands with
                    him and said goodby—all of this is on television, by the way—and then walk over
                    to the cockpit of the airplane and spoke to the pilot, whom I knew, and said,
                    “If you are not back here in the morning I am going to come on to you. I don't
                    care if I have to buy Guyana Airways or the Embassy does, we will do so.” He
                    said, “Don't worry about it, if they won't give me authority to do it, I will
                    come back on my own.”</p>
                <p>So I turned away from the cockpit. Ryan was standing out by the wing tip. The
                    airplane was facing south and the engines were running. Ryan started to walk
                    towards the aircraft when a farm tractor pulled on to the field towing a farm
                    cart with wooden sides going up two or three feet. I might also add,
                    incidentally, although as it turned out they had little to do with the story,
                    there was also a military aircraft, a small airplane, on the field that had
                    broken its nose wheel. There was a lieutenant and two or three military men
                    there guarding the aircraft, possibly to repair it, I don't know. They had their
                    tents there and were armed.</p>
                <p>The tractor pulled on to the field and came down along the side of the tarmac. I
                    turned around to look and as we watched, nine or ten people stood up from the
                    truck and they had various guns.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was from the cart that was being towed.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>DWYER: Yes, from the cart that was being towed by the tractor. They had various
                    guns—shotguns, 22s, 306 and various other things. But no automatic weapons. And
                    they began firing. The Congressman was obviously a target. He and I ran around
                    the front nose of the aircraft. The tractor which had the cart from which people
                    were firing at us was between the airplane and the bush on the one side of the
                    airstrip so those people who were closer to the bush could run off into the
                    bush, while those of us at the airplane and in front of it didn't have much of a
                    place to go. We decided to independently run across the tarmac to the protection
                    of some houses and trees on the other side.About at that stage the NBC
                    television tape ends with the murder of the cameraman. It was all filmed from
                    the time the firing began. He was obviously a target. I got to the other side of
                    the airplane and decided that there was just no way that I could possibly make
                    it across another 75 yards of open territory and decided that I would play dead.
                    As I was about to artistically fall to the ground, and indeed I must have almost
                    been on the ground, somebody shot me. [In Indiana where I am from you only shoot
                    birds on the fly you don't shoot them on the ground.] Somebody got me with a 22
                    long. As I later learned I wasn't badly hurt. It had entered my left thigh and
                    lodged up near the spine—it is still there, it is more dangerous to take it out
                    than leave it alone.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I was on the ground there. Staccato firing continued for what seemed like
                    a long time, but probably couldn't have been more than a couple of minutes. I
                    had thought that the reason I didn't want to run across the tarmac or try to go
                    any further was because I thought we were in a cross-fire between the big truck
                    that was parked on the other side of the tarmac from the tractor. I had thought
                    that we were being fired on from that truck. Later only one other person thought
                    we had been fired on from that truck, so I don't know whether we were or not.
                    Anyway, I was convinced we were and that I would never make it passed that
                    truck.</p>
                <p>I lay on the ground and the firing stopped. I was trying to pretend that I was
                    dead. I couldn't decide whether I would be more convincing playing dead with my
                    eyes open or closed. Finally I decided that I at least would like to see those
                    bastards. I heard feet on the loose stones of the dirt on the tarmac and a
                    shotgun went off. More steps and the shotgun went off again. Ryan had obviously
                    been hit more than once. I had seen those five or six feet from me curled around
                    the wheel of the airplane landing gear apparently for protection. The shotgun
                    continued for five shots including right next to me—Ryan. I was waiting for the
                    next shot which never came. To this day I do not know why. I suspect that it was
                    a five shot shotgun and the last one was used on Ryan.</p>
                <p>The steps went away and I lay on the ground until finally I heard the vehicles
                    drive away. There was no conversation, no shouts that I recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The plane was still there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>DWYER: The plane was still there and the engines were running—or were they
                    running? No, I guess they weren't.</p>
                <p>After a few moments I looked around carefully and there wasn't anybody there. The
                    Washington Post reporter, who was lying not far from me and I knew had done the
                    same thing as I had, played doggo, Charles Kraus, got up. I walked around to the
                    congressman. He had been shot, obviously, more than once. Probably with a rifle,
                    but the better part of his face had been blown away with the shotgun. The
                    cameraman was dead. The photographer from the Hearst newspapers was dead.
                    Everyone had fled the airplane into the bush and when I went into the airplane
                    Mrs. Parks, Dale Parks' mother was sitting in a seat near the door with most of
                    her head blown away by a shotgun blast at short range. Her face was still there
                    but there was nothing behind it. It was incredible.</p>
                <p>We had wounded all over the place. Jackie Spears had been badly hurt. A couple of
                    the NBC cameramen had been badly hurt. My immediate concern was that these
                    people could come back and finish the job. Why they didn't finish the job I
                    don't know. I guess the fact was that they were not very good at anything. We
                    carried the wounded over to the tall grass and hit them as much as we could. It
                    wasn't too good as you could see the tracks going into the grass. When that was
                    done I went over to talk to the pilot. Again I talked to him at the cockpit of
                    the airplane because he needed magnetos to try to get his radio running. We were
                    talking over the roar of the engines and I couldn't hear very well, so I decided
                    to board the airplane. I mentioned earlier that I had been around airplanes
                    since I was 3 years old or younger. I walked into the propeller of this one! It
                    sliced off the material of my left sleeve and all I could think of was here
                    people have been shooting at me, I lie on the ground playing dead, and then I
                    walk into a propeller. But, God was with me that day, and I only lost a piece of
                    my shirt. I backed away, got on the airplane and asked the pilot if he could fly
                    it. He had a crew of three—a pilot, copilot and steward. He said that the port
                    engine of the aircraft had been hit several times and he had lost throttle
                    control on it, but that he was willing to take off with me if I wanted to give
                    it a chance, but he felt there was no way that he could get off with a full load
                    with only one engine. That wasn't the idea. The idea was to get the wounded out
                    and as many others out as we could.</p>
                <p>I had in the interval and when we still thought we could use the plane, rounded
                    up an Amerindian, which is what the Indian of Guyana is called. We carried Mrs.
                    Parks' body out of the aircraft and laid it on the tarmac thinking that maybe we
                    could use the airplane.</p>
                <p>We then went around and I tried to make a list of who was wounded and who was
                    dead. My problem was that I didn't know these people and I had to depend on
                    their relatives and the press to determine who they were. I then put the list in
                    my pocket. This was to be the source of some concern later to the conspiratorial
                    theorists and what have you who accused the Department of covering up who had
                    been killed, and who had been wounded. We were like hell! The list I gave to the
                    pilot of the aircraft. Wait a minute, I know what I did. I took the pilot's
                    manifest and used that and then made a list of my own.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>About that time, Dale Parks, one of the People's Temple figures who was leaving,
                    came up to me with Charles Kraus, holding Larry Layton. And there were a couple
                    of local people with them. I might add that the government representatives and
                    everybody else had just disappeared into the bush.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the soldiers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: I will get to that in a minute. I was a little angry with the
                    soldiers.</p>
                <p>Anyway they came up with Larry Layton and said that he had gotten on the small
                    airplane and had shot and tried to kill a woman, a People's Temple person who
                    was leaving, and had tried to shoot the other two people who were leaving but
                    the gun had misfired after a couple of shots. Dale Parks had wrestled the gun
                    away from him. Layton wasn't saying anything. My Amerindian friend who had
                    helped me with the body of Mrs. Parks said, “Boss, you want we take this boy for
                    a walk in the woods?” There were times through the trial of Larry Layton later
                    that I wished I had let Larry Layton go for a walk in the woods with the
                    Indians. But their intent was clear and I found somebody else who took him back
                    to Port Kaituma and locked him up in an office in the government house
                    there.</p>
                <p>We started to walk back to the little airplane which had its engine running. The
                    small aircraft had not been harmed. To Kraus and my surprise it started to take
                    off. It took off with the pilot of the small aircraft on it, the pilot of the
                    airliner, the copilot and the steward we could see. The pilot of the airliner
                    was pointing behind him towards the road that led to the People's Temple and the
                    plane disappeared into the sky. Charles Kraus and I thought that he was warning
                    us that somebody was coming or that they were coming back so we all ran into the
                    bush and shouted for everyone to hide. We stayed there for about 15 minutes and
                    came out and it suddenly dawned on me and on Mr. Kraus that the s.o.b. was just
                    leaving. The aircraft crew of the large airplane and the pilot of the small
                    airplane had taken off with one wounded girl leaving the rest on the ground.
                    They were absolutely no help whatsoever.</p>
                <p>The pilot subsequently—I refused to talk to him for quite a while I just didn't
                    want to see the guy again. He was persistent and came in to explain that he
                    wanted to get back and felt he was the only one who could fly and assure that
                    the small airplane would get back because the pilot of the small airplane was in
                    no condition to fly because he was so frightened. He wanted to get back, get
                    help and come back in. But the Guyanese authorities would not allow him to fly
                    back at night. Whatever the reason was, I was not happy.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>I then went up to the lieutenant, who had a side arm and whose men had a couple
                    of automatic weapons between them and said, “What the hell were you doing? Where
                    were you?” I am not a man easily aroused but I was as angry as I have ever been
                    in my life, I think. He said, “Well, boss, we didn't know which group of
                    Americans was shooting the other group of Americans and decided it wasn't any of
                    our business.” I informed him, which was true, that I had had dinner the night
                    before with his regimental commander and his immediate superior officers and I
                    would personally guarantee him retirement as a corporal if he were lucky, unless
                    he got to it and moved his stuff out of the tent that he was in and moved the
                    wounded in there and put them on the soldiers' cots. We gathered up the rest of
                    the walking wounded and the others and went to a little tavern there where the
                    operators lived above. They made available a couple of rooms and everybody sat
                    there. I gave the woman who ran the tavern some money.</p>
                <p>I assembled the group and gave them a little pep talk the best I could. I said
                    they could have a drink if they want but...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were the people such as the lawyers and...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: The lawyers were not there. They were back at the Temple.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the news crew?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: In absolute shock. Everyone there had cameras but not one of them pulled
                    them out. The cameraman was killed, his audio guy had half of his arm shot away.
                    The anchorman for the NBC production that had interviewed Jones, etc. had
                    obviously been a target. He had been killed. Bob Flick the producer of the show
                    was just absolutely stunned. He had worked with this crew through Vietnam and
                    various war zones among other places, and was just absolutely crushed that here
                    in this rinky-dink country's backwoods he had lost a major part of his crew. He
                    sat with the wounded all night and refused to leave. He gave them water, took
                    care of them, held their hands. Took down what we thought were their last words,
                    etc. The rest of the news crew took 45 minutes and a number of them were back to
                    normal. They began writing their notes and comparing stories.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>The People's Temple group were remarkable and so were the relatives. Nobody
                    panicked, nobody broke down into hysterics. I don't know whether it was the idea
                    of having lived with People's Temple and being used to doing what somebody said
                    without complaint or whether it was a hard life that they stood up for
                    themselves, but it was a truly remarkable group—even the children. As a matter
                    of fact, two or three of the younger children, the Parks children, as they were
                    being fired upon and just after their mother had been killed, ran out and shut
                    the door of the airplane. Otherwise the whole crew in the interior of the
                    airplane would have been sitting ducks for these guys. The kids disappeared into
                    the bush and weren't seen for a couple of days. A remarkable group.</p>
                <p>Jackie Spears was badly wounded. I was concerned whether she was going to live
                    throughout the night. She asked me to look after Ryan's briefcase which had
                    tapes in it of all these things. This was to become a source of minor contention
                    later.</p>
                <p>We sat there and waited and hoped for relief from Georgetown. We posted someone
                    to keep a watch on the road coming from People's Temple. We even had a password
                    for those local Guyanese we didn't know. So we had the most seriously wounded I
                    was afraid to move on the tarmac in the tent; the dead were still lying on the
                    ground. Night came and nobody else did. We were told by People's Temple
                    representatives, I mean the defectors from the People's Temple, that they were
                    sure that the White Night would be for real back at Jonestown. The White Night,
                    I learned had been a rehearsal for death that Jones would have people go through
                    a number of times in the middle of the night. He would get everybody out of bed
                    by the loudspeakers and they would come in and he would harangue them and pass
                    them cool aid or some such drink and tell them that it was poison. They would
                    drink it and...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this the first time you had heard about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Certainly in any detail. I don't know whether the name was familiar or
                    not. There had been a girl who had left People's Temple with the Embassy's help,
                    come back and given a press conference in which she described it in June or
                    July. So I certainly had heard about it. I was in a very impressionable state
                    you could say and most unhappy. The little bar was all out of good Guyanese beer
                    amongst other things and by this time I was having a little problem navigating.
                    If I sat down for any length of time I had a difficult time getting up
                    again.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>The long and short of it was that we waited, waited and waited. Early in the
                    morning and before dawn, I would say around 3:00, the government representative
                    from the village came down to say that he had been finally in radio contact with
                    Georgetown. That a company of troops were being flown into Matthew's Ridge and
                    would take the little freight train that used to haul the ore down to Kaituma.
                    It was commanded by a captain or major that I knew. I went back with him and
                    called the Embassy. By this time, of course, they knew what had happened because
                    the pilots had gotten back and been debriefed by the Prime Minister with the
                    American Ambassador present. But the details were still not known. I spoke to
                    our ambassador and filled him in on what had happened and urged him to get
                    relief up there as quickly as possible.The shooting had occurred about 4 or 5:00
                    in the afternoon and as I say we had nothing but the first aid kit on the
                    airplane to try and bandage these people with. We found a nurse from a
                    dispensary. She brought down all the morphine tablets she had—there weren't
                    many. We were giving some people rum but I was concerned. Obviously they were
                    going to need a lot of medical attention and I was afraid to give them too much
                    morphine or too much rum, even though they were in severe pain. Amazing though
                    how little complaint there was, it was just incredible.</p>
                <p>The commander of the troops came in 4 or 5:00 in the morning. I expressed my
                    concern that these people might come back again. I asked where his company was.
                    He said he had driven—they found one landrover at Matthew's Ridge with enough
                    gas to get down to Port Kaituma. The rest of them were taking the train down and
                    would be dismounting several miles away from Port Kaituma and walk in because he
                    was afraid of sabotage of the train. I learned later that he had been with
                    forces in Angola and the Angolans evidently had a habit of blowing up the train
                    when reinforcements came in. The full company arrived an hour or two later and
                    we posted them around the perimeter of the tarmac and the tavern where the
                    people were assembled, and for the first time I felt reasonably safe.</p>
                <p>All this time we did not know what had gone on at Jonestown, except for one or
                    two people who had gotten away and came back with stories saying that they were
                    all dead—killing themselves. But this came with a story that one of the people
                    in our group told me, that they had made a tank at Jonestown which was hidden in
                    the woods—all kinds of rumors.</p>
                <p>We didn't get an airplane in there until 10:00 in the morning. It had been light
                    for four hours by this time. When it came it was an army aircraft. It had no
                    facilities for taking care of the wounded—no doctors, no bandages, nothing. I
                    was increasingly mad. The pilot was adamant that he was not supposed to go back.
                    And I said, “You are going back.” We took the seats out and put the worst of the
                    wounded in it and he went back. Part of the problem was fuel. There was no fuel
                    at Port Kaituma and you had to bring it or go up to Matthew's Ridge where they
                    were installing fuel supplies. So that was where the airplanes were.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>A little while later an Embassy officer arrived—he wasn't on the first plane—a
                    guy who was in our political section and whose job was the military and couldn't
                    have been a better man for the job. He knew all the military in the army,
                    himself, and he was their best contact. By this time we had had a series of
                    airplanes in and I had gotten everybody out and there was one last space on the
                    last airplane for me. And out from the woods comes one of our defectors who had
                    been hiding in the woods for nearly 24 hours. I looked at this guy and he looked
                    at me. I said, “Oh, what the hell, get on the airplane, go.” So he went.</p>
                <p>So the Embassy guy and I were there and I was looking at a second night. In the
                    meantime the police had come up and I had gone around with one of the inspectors
                    and surveyed the bodies and taken the valuables from them the best I could. We
                    lost some things. The newsman's widow from California was terribly upset with me
                    because I had not saved a gold necklace from her husband's neck that it had
                    somehow disappeared by the time the body got back to California. It had been a
                    wedding gift or something. It was terribly difficult. I couldn't explain to her
                    that he had received the full brunt of the shotgun and that I was having trouble
                    enough doing what I was doing without dismembering her husband's corpse to get a
                    gold necklace.</p>
                <p>Then the guy from the Embassy and myself looked around for somewhere—the bodies
                    were still on the ground. The police had come up and had done whatever they were
                    supposed to do, although it was frankly a bit of a joke in Guyana. And just
                    about as we were going to retire and were looking for a place to sleep that
                    night, the smaller military airplane came in. It had body bags on it. The
                    soldiers put the bodies in the body bags and we put them in the back of the
                    airplane and went back to Georgetown.</p>
                <p>By this time it was almost dusk again. We flew into a small airport. We had
                    gotten a funeral director to take the bodies and he met us at the airport. We
                    had had excellent response from Washington. An ambulance plane had been in and
                    taken out all the wounded and taken off again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your wound?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Well, here I was. As it happened we lived next door to a hospital so I
                    went home and had a cold beer, tried not to sit on any thing and took a hot
                    shower. The Embassy nurse came over and shot me full of antibiotics and
                    penicillin and made me promise to check into the hospital the next day. They
                    wanted to take me over there but I wanted to sleep in my own bed that night. The
                    Ambassador came over and debriefed me. I learned of the murders of Sharon Amos
                    and her children at the People's Temple headquarters in Georgetown. Apparently
                    there had been instructions that everybody down there would kill themselves.
                    Whether Sharon Amos had to kill her own children or whether another member of
                    the People's Temple, slightly retarded, did so, we didn't know. But things were
                    a mess, obviously.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>The next morning I walked over to the hospital—a little Catholic hospital—they
                    had a good surgeon, Sister Mary something or other, from Baltimore. I said to
                    her that I didn't know if I should be in there in her nice clean little hospital
                    or rather I should go to the big dirty Georgetown General hospital where they
                    see lots of gun shot wounds. She said not to worry, that she had done her
                    internship in south Philadelphia and new all about such wounds. So she cut me
                    open, cleaned me out and decided to leave the bullet in me because it would be
                    too much of a task to get it out, at least in Georgetown. I was in the hospital
                    for four days or so until I began to get terribly antsy and got up one afternoon
                    and went down to the office. The hospital was very upset, but I was more
                    concerned about what was going on—what we were doing with the rest of the group
                    than I was...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: October 12, 1990. This is a continuation of an interview
                        with Richard Dwyer. Dick when we left off the last time you had said you
                        just couldn't stand staying in the hospital any more. You got out of bed,
                        despite the objections of the nurses, and headed for the Embassy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Well, that is right. We had come back from Port Kaituma and Jonestown late
                    Sunday afternoon. That flight back with the bodies and the congressman and three
                    of the people who had been killed was the most difficult thing. It had been
                    raining up there in Port Kaituma and I hadn't been dry for two days or so and
                    anyway we got back. The Ambassador came over and I had a conversation with him
                    and then the Embassy nurse came over and shot me full of tetanus shots and what
                    have you. The next morning, Monday, I went into the office, again over
                    everybody's objection, but I wanted to read the traffic that had been coming in
                    and going out and see what was going on. I also had some stuff that I had to do.
                    So I went into the office and dictated a long telegram on what had happened up
                    at Jonestown from the time we started out until the time we got back. Then I
                    took care of some personal stuff that I had been procrastinating about doing
                    before and did it all in about 20 minutes. I should say that the Embassy on
                    Monday morning was obviously a beehive of activity. The Ambassador had been
                    offered somebody to replace me for a while until I was back in working order.
                    Ironically the first choice happened to be the man with whom I had served as DCM
                    in Africa, one of the ambassador's there, someone who I was convinced had never
                    made a decision in his life. I told John Burke if you bring this guy in I go
                    home right now. So we agreed on someone else. The Embassy by this time were
                    beginning to get—the most difficult decision that the Ambassador had to make at
                    that time was what to do with the bodies up at Jonestown. The Guyanese
                    government had come to him with the request that the bodies be taken back to the
                    United States. John Burke quite correctly went back to Washington asking for
                    instructions on how to do it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was no way they could all be buried there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: They could have been buried there, but there were all sorts of problems.
                    By this time on Monday morning—on Sunday evening just as I was leaving the
                    military went in to Jonestown and discovered, of course, that the worst had come
                    to pass and there were 900 odd bodies lying on the ground in the tropical heat
                    already beginning to decompose. The options were fairly limited. One of the
                    major things to do was try to identify the bodies and I believe they had brought
                    back to Jonestown a couple of the People's Temple members who went around and
                    tried to identify the bodies, as many as they knew. They tagged them all. Of
                    course they tagged them all with washable ink someone told me later and when the
                    first rain came along it was all gone.</p>
                <p>The Guyanese government, of course, was completely overwhelmed. There were no
                    forensic facilities to speak of at all, etc. The only option seemed to be to
                    just bury them up there, but this had all kinds of problems. We knew that
                    relatives and other people would certainly want to have the bodies of their
                    relatives back, although as it turned out there were not that many. There were a
                    lot of people up there without relatives or with relatives who didn't want the
                    bodies back. In any event, Burke strongly urged the Department to do this and we
                    did so. So the Air Force came in with crews to take the bodies back. These crews
                    were coming in on Monday morning. A typical Air Force operation—you know just an
                    enormous mound of equipment and airplanes and everything else. The Embassy at
                    the time had—I forget how many now, but I think something like 70 or 80
                    survivors—that had to be taken care of. I had an outside telephone on my desk in
                    my office and this had been hooked up with the Operations Center with a speaker
                    phone and was just left open for 24 hours a day. We had, with the Department's
                    help, borrowed several consular officers from surrounding posts to help with the
                    problems. I said earlier that we had never been fully staffed in the consular
                    section, since I had been there.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I went in the office and found a very nice telegram from the Secretary
                    there and another from Barbara Watson who was head of Consular Affairs at the
                    time, plus all kinds of people I had never seen before. I took care of what
                    business I could and then that afternoon I went over and checked myself into the
                    hospital.</p>
                <p>There was a nun there—this was the Sisters of Mercy hospital which was
                    conveniently only a block from our house. An American nun who was a surgeon
                    quite correctly operated on me and cleaned me up. She left the bullet in because
                    they had no facilities for getting it out. Besides it seemed better to leave it
                    in than try to take it out as it was lodged near the spine. So I sat in the
                    hospital terribly frustrated knowing that things were going on in the office and
                    I wanted to be in on what was going on.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>We were submerged by the press, there must have been a couple of hundred—2 or 3
                    hundred I would guess—from all over the world. Everyone from Agence France
                    Presse to somebody from Spain and all the American news service and everything
                    else. They besieged my poor wife and family in trying to get in and talk with
                    me. I said that I was simply not going to talk with anybody. Fortunately we had
                    a very good man working for me, my driver. My wife had him sitting at the
                    telephone trying to deflect some of these calls in the days before telephone
                    answering things—which still may not be available in Guyana. I remember my wife
                    telling me that one guy called up and said he was calling on behalf of the
                    Minister of Information, who was a woman, Mrs. Field Wrigley, and this obviously
                    American said, “Well Mrs. Wrigley Field told me to call”. Only an American would
                    have reversed that—and from Chicago.</p>
                <p>So, by the time I was—I was operated on and cleaned up on Tuesday morning. My
                    Guyanese friends were just wonderful. I had a steady stream of friends, plus the
                    FBI. The FBI wanted that bullet in the worse possible way. They kind of reminded
                    me of a pointer, a hunting dog, in the bush watching the bird and sort of
                    quivering. He knew the bird was there and couldn't get at it.</p>
                <p>By Saturday I felt well enough, despite what my nuns were saying, and I asked for
                    something to sign and went back to the office and back to work and fortunately I
                    was all right. The wound was relatively clean and there was just a minor
                    infection which meant I had to be cleaned out occasionally, but there was no
                    great problem with that except that it was terribly uncomfortable to sit down
                    for a great length of time.</p>
                <p>The major immediate problems at the Embassy were threefold. The first was the
                    removal of the bodies. The second was the preservation, insofar as possible, of
                    the site at People's Temple because we knew that the records and what have you
                    of the People's Temple would be terribly important. And there came the question
                    of course—there was all kinds of personal property up there and as it turned out
                    all kinds of cash and everything else. So that was a second priority. Another
                    priority was obviously the remaining people from People's Temple up there.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>For the first couple of days after the tragedy of Jonestown, particularly, there
                    was a high state of wariness because many of the People's Temple people had told
                    us that there had been plans that if this White Night or mass suicides or
                    murders ever came to pass why there were hit teams that were supposed to go out
                    and assassinate various people. And indeed in Georgetown at the People's Temple
                    headquarters the People's Temple representative and her three or four children
                    had been killed or had committed suicide. I am not sure that anybody will know
                    for sure, but certainly the younger children did not slit their own throats. We
                    were told there was a People's Temple basketball team that had included a number
                    of the People's Temple security people that was in Georgetown to play a
                    basketball game with a Georgetown team—so these fellows were wandering around.
                    Right about that time, I can't exactly remember when, then or a few days later,
                    the mayor of San Francisco, Moscone, had been assassinated and there was concern
                    in Georgetown, and I presume in San Francisco as well, that this might have been
                    People's Temple hit. As it turned out it was not.</p>
                <p>Anyway we had 60 or 80 people. The Embassy had to find housing for them,
                    transportation back to the States and all the usual problems of evacuating a
                    sizeable group of Americans, complicated by the fact that the Guyanese police
                    wanted to talk to many of them as to what had actually happened. This was a
                    source of great concern because all these people wanted to do was to get out of
                    there. They were terribly frightened. We had all kinds of problems with them.
                    The usual types of things. I can remember shortly after I got back I got a
                    telephone call from the manager of one of the hotels that we had some of these
                    people in saying that this one guy was bringing in girls from the street and had
                    gotten into a fight with a fellow People's Temple member he was sharing a room
                    with about whether the girls could come in or not. I had to talk to this guy and
                    tell him that we were giving him his room and board but were not paying for the
                    girls. He could do what he wanted, but not in the hotel. And things like that
                    which normally would have been taken care of by the consular section.</p>
                <p>The Embassy was on 24 hour shifts and we were talking with everybody. When the
                    Air Force people went in to Jonestown to bring the bodies back, someone had
                    started the rumor that there were whole fields of marijuana there. Then we got
                    the drug enforcement agency saying that they wanted to come down and go in.
                    Everybody wanted a piece of the action. And it turned out that these were not
                    marijuana trees at all, they were a tropical vegetable that looked a little bit
                    like the marijuana leaf to some of these kids, apparently. So it was a busy
                    time.</p>
                <p>We did get somebody down in the interval to take my place while I was in the
                    hospital. A very good man but ironically for me as I mentioned earlier as an
                    Inspector in the Foreign Service I had done an inspection of the security
                    division of the State Department which took care of the Secretary's personal
                    security. And it happened to be the then Deputy Assistant Secretary for this
                    division about whom I had written a rather critical report, that I found at my
                    desk when I walked in. But he was a good man.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But tell me, there is almost a pattern to these things. We
                        are seeing it right now. I am talking on October 12, 1990 when tensions are
                        very high, Iraqi has just taken over Kuwait. First you have crisis
                        situation. Everyone chips in and really gets the job done. Then there is the
                        period, and I am not talking about just within the Foreign Service, but
                        looking around for a scapegoat or recriminations. Did you feel a change
                        saying “well, the Embassy should have known about this or done this,”
                        particularly when you get congress and all involved? They are looking around
                        and in a way you are the closest people to the spot.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Well that was to come. It took them a little while. In many ways I was a
                    bit insulated from a lot of this because the people we had left Jonestown with
                    had been very complimentary about me up in Jonestown and at Port Kaituma
                    airport. Therefore, as the only representative who had been up there, the only
                    Embassy person up there, I was most in demand for the press—I was the guy people
                    wanted to talk to. The FBI and everybody else. This was no problem for me. There
                    was nothing up there that I couldn't talk about. We had a dozen representatives
                    of the press right with me for every moment. But indeed this was to come. The
                    most far out thing to come that developed was a series of newspaper articles out
                    on the west coast, picked up by some of the wire services, alleging that this
                    had all been a CIA conspiracy. That Jonestown had been used by the CIA to
                    experiment with mind-control drugs and that I, Dwyer, was their man on the scene
                    and that after we had all been shot up at the airport had gone back to Jonestown
                    somehow and cleaned up everything and hidden all the records and things that
                    this. In part this came from the admin assistant of Congressman Ryan, who just
                    judging by the news reports had just gone off the deep end but good. In part it
                    was due to some young guy over in CIA, I don't know who it was, who had told
                    this guy and maybe somebody else that he had direct reports from their man on
                    the scene, so he could give them the hot poop. There wasn't anybody there, I was
                    it. It was frustrating as hell for any Foreign Service Officer as you know we
                    have standard procedures for questions such as that. Any Foreign Service Officer
                    who is asked such a question is to say that he can neither confirm or deny any
                    such rumor. In someway I wish I had just told the State Department to go to hell
                    and said, “No, I am not CIA, never was and do not intend to be.”</p>
                <p>Yet we were sensitive there because there had been a man in Georgetown who had
                    been with the Agency, had been station chief. He had been identified as such in
                    a book by a man called James Agee and he had been assassinated, possibly because
                    of this identification in the book, in Greece just a year or two before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was in 1974, I think, or '75.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Yes, about that time.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>Anyway these rumors were the most far out ones. These things resurface from time
                    to time. A couple of years later while I was in Martinique, I got a call from
                    Jack Anderson's column, I forget which one, one of these guys who wanted to hear
                    what I had to say about this. I said, “Well, first of all it was all nonsense,
                    because if you would call Bob Flick from NBC news, with whom I had spent most of
                    my first night up there and anyone of the other news people, you would find that
                    my time was completely taken and accounted for and there was no way that I could
                    have hobbled back to Jonestown.” And Jack Anderson, of course, merely reprinted
                    the allegations saying that Dwyer denies it. I am still mad about it.</p>
                <p>With all the newsmen down there one of the big problems, of course, was that they
                    had nothing to report. They interviewed all the survivors a dozen times each and
                    then they interviewed themselves. That was about all that they could do.
                    Eventually some of them were flown up to Jonestown or managed to tag along with
                    some of the military aircraft going up there. Mark Lane the lawyer, with whom
                    the government of Guyana wanted to talk very badly had left the country quietly
                    by some private plane going in and out. By this time the Guyana airport looked
                    more like National with all these planes coming in and out. Guyanese customs and
                    immigration were just overwhelmed, of course, so Mark Lane one of the principals
                    simply disappeared back to the United States where he began his lecture career
                    again.</p>
                <p>We sent a consular officer up there who nailed consular notices all over
                    Jonestown saying that this was American property and tried to seal the premises,
                    which, of course, didn't work very well. Then the consular officers, with help
                    from the military, began grabbing all the records they could find, to bring them
                    back to Georgetown. We made an agreement with the Guyanese government that would
                    permit the FBI to take these records back to the United States and go through
                    them on the condition that they would be returned to the Guyanese
                    government—which indeed they were. But these, I don't know how many now, dozens
                    and dozens of large footlockers full of things. It turned out that the People's
                    Temple kept incredible records on everything. The kind of things we were looking
                    for immediately were things like dental charts so that the bodies could be
                    identified when they were brought back to Dover, Delaware at the Air Force
                    facility there. We found all kinds of dental records which were a great
                    help.</p>
                <p>Eventually we made agreements with the Guyanese government to get out as many of
                    the people, the survivors, as we could with a few exceptions, the people they
                    wanted to talk to specifically.</p>
                <p>Only one person eventually was charged in Guyana with a crime and that was the
                    man who had been at the Georgetown People's Temple office—a man of somewhat
                    below intelligence who was suspected of and eventually was convicted of helping
                    Sharon Amos kill her children. He had been an ex-Marine, but he was functionally
                    illiterate and to this day it was quite possible he did what he was accused of
                    but in no way was he a leader or anything else of the group. And he served some
                    time there.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>The other person who was accused of the conspiracy and the murders was Larry
                    Layton. Larry Layton had been on the small airplane. He had been the one I had
                    been warned about and the congressman and the news people had been warned
                    about—that he was probably not a true defector. He had been accused of shooting
                    two people on the small airplane. He was held for trial. To jump ahead of
                    myself, it was a long time, I think a year, before he was brought to trial.
                    Eventually when he was brought to trial we could only get—the Guyanese
                    government could only get one People's Temple member to come back and testify
                    against him. Unfortunately this young man was a bad witness in Guyana. He was
                    gay and he arrived in Guyana wearing a tank top and shorts and all kinds of
                    little half moon earrings in one ear and stars in the other. Although a very
                    nice man, a serious decent man who had a lot of courage to come back there, the
                    Guyanese defense lawyer for Larry Layton made a lot of this man's personal
                    sexual proclivities and I am sure it didn't help.</p>
                <p>In addition to which, the Guyanese government did not prosecute this case as well
                    as they might. I think they did it purposely. They just didn't want this guy in
                    Guyana; they vastly preferred to get rid of him. So Larry Layton was acquitted.
                    Back in the United States he admitted that he had in fact shot these people, so
                    there was no question about it. The Guyanese government had the decency of at
                    least putting him on a direct flight to Miami where he was arrested by the FBI.
                    Now remember, only because of a law passed in the late ''60s or early ''70s was
                    there any crime committed in another country that an American citizen could be
                    accused of. It was not a crime in the United States for an American citizen to
                    murder someone in Guyana. But the law had been changed so that the crime of
                    conspiracy to murder or the actual murder of a certain class of people, which
                    included Foreign Service Officer and members of congress, could be prosecuted in
                    the United States.</p>
                <p>By the time we began to get the identity straightened out of the people who died
                    at Jonestown, the FBI came to the conclusion that all of those that had attacked
                    us at the airport were dead. I had a little list in my office and whenever we
                    would identify one I would check him off. I was very much relieved when we found
                    that the last one there had been checked off. Larry Layton, because he had hung
                    around a little bit too long, because I had grabbed him along with Dale Parks
                    and Charles Kraus and then we had locked him up, was the only one of the group
                    that had not gone back to Jonestown and killed himself. But we knew that Layton
                    had not fired on me or the congressman because he was in the smaller airplane.
                    And so he was prosecuted on the charge of conspiracy to murder, and conspiracy,
                    of course, is a difficult thing to prove, particularly when everyone else is
                    dead.</p>
                <p>Anyway, that is getting ahead of the story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And also you know from a practical point of view if we can
                        stick to, because I think we are going to have to cut now, what happened to
                        you and how this played as far as it affected you.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>DWYER: In a week to ten days, I would guess, we had gotten out of the country
                    most of the People's Temple people there. Oh, I should add to that these people
                    in Jonestown recorded everything on audio tapes. They had all of Jim Jones'
                    speeches or harangues to the group and incredibly enough we discovered a tape of
                    that last 45 minutes of the People's Temple. This was obviously going to be very
                    valuable testimony and Ambassador Burke had taken very careful pains to build up
                    insofar as possible a history of this—a trail of possession so that it would be
                    useable in court. We had problems with that. A young consul who was down there
                    from Panama had leaked this to the press and, of course, we were under explicit
                    instructions that this was to go to the Department of Justice and that we were
                    to do absolutely nothing with it but to take care of it.</p>
                <p>That tape affected me too because it included Jim Jones' last harangue to the
                    People's Temple saying that they should all kill themselves, that the
                    congressman was dead and although Jones was not responsible for it he felt
                    responsible for everything that had happened and therefore the time had come to
                    make the final protest which was to be mass suicide. The people had come back
                    from the airport to say that the airplanes were to be brought down on their
                    return to Georgetown. I am glad I didn't know that before but apparently this
                    was Layton who was suppose to shoot everybody on his airplane and take the plane
                    into the jungle. To this day we do not know whether there was to be somebody
                    else to do that on the larger aircraft or not. Then Jim Jones presumed that I
                    had come back and said, “Where is Dwyer?” “Take Dwyer and put him with the
                    lawyers,” he said. Of course I was not there, I was at the airport, but because
                    of that it helped a lot of these rumors or allegations that I was there running
                    the CIA mind control thing. The fact that it was leaked to the press almost
                    immediately was no particular help.</p>
                <p>When I got out of the hospital the speaker phone was still on my desk, by this
                    time it had been a week that it had been open—this long distance call from
                    Washington. I told the admin officer that he was going to get a high telephone
                    bill from the telephone on my desk, but not to blame it on me. But I don't know
                    what they did about it. The Guyanese government was not very good at billing
                    telephone rates, everybody complained about it because you had no record of what
                    it was. I think this came in as a $30,000 telephone bill or something and the
                    Guyanese government said that couldn't be right so cut it down when, in fact,
                    for the first time they probably got it right.</p>
                <p>Then I spent a lot of time talking on the telephone with the relatives. That was
                    difficult. The NBC reporter who had been killed up there had been newly married
                    and his bride was on the telephone and wanted to know what had happened to the
                    gold necklace she had given him on their first wedding anniversary or something,
                    because it was not on the body. I just didn't have the heart to describe to her
                    the conditions there or what it looked like—it obviously had been stolen,
                    probably by some Guyanese.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>Then there was all kinds of cash floating around. Two members of the People's
                    Temple had been arrested by the Guyanese authorities trying to get back to
                    Georgetown with a suitcase with a couple of hundred thousand dollars worth of
                    cash in it. I forget the exact amount, but it was a substantial amount of money.
                    The Guyanese government had this cash and we wanted to get it back to put it
                    into the People's Temple's coffers. By this time the People's Temple had been
                    put into receivership. There were probably other substantial sums of cash that
                    disappeared. Going back to Jonestown later and talking with some of the natives,
                    they were all full of $20 bills so a lot of this was circulating around. This
                    particular set of cash had supposedly been given to these two guys with a
                    revolver by Maria, one of Jones' top aides, with instructions to take it to the
                    Soviet Embassy in Guyana.</p>
                <p>The records were needed too. We spent a lot of time trying to trace bank accounts
                    where the money had gone to. Eventually the People's Temple receiver had about
                    ten million bucks, I think. How much of this was lost or disappeared into bank
                    accounts that we had never heard of—maybe in Venezuela, maybe in the Cayman
                    Islands, maybe elsewhere. But a lot of time was spent on this.</p>
                <p>We were negotiating with the banks in Guyana, for example. The banks could not
                    legally release information to us on this, but enough of us knew enough people
                    in the community to know what questions to ask and where to go to look, so we
                    did some stuff there.</p>
                <p>This was now November, through November into early December. By mid December the
                    Embassy went off its 24 hour a day shift and things began to get back to normal,
                    or as normal as they could with all these things. The records from People's
                    Temple began to come back—that the FBI shipped back. We had them locked up in
                    the Embassy to return to the Guyanese government as we had agreed to do. They
                    had all been indexed by the FBI. I couldn't begin to go through all these
                    things, but I did go through a lot of it. I spent a lot of evenings there
                    reading through it. Obviously my main personal concern was could/should I have
                    done something to prevent this. What should the Embassy have done that it had
                    not done?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the continuation of our talk. You were going
                        through the files to see whether there had been clues you had missed or
                        someone in the Embassy may have missed...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: This was an incredible mass of material. I mentioned earlier that
                    apparently Jones had set up a rule that when anybody of the People's Temple
                    talked with someone outside, not one but three reports were made of the
                    conversation. I found papers, for example, that a number of people whose names I
                    had come to know had signed alleging that they had performed illegal acts or
                    something. Apparently this was a means of control at the People's Temple. It
                    would get people to confess to, or for all I know, make up illegal things that
                    they had done.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were mentioning the incest accusation which was a
                        fairly common, I mean appeared more often then might statistically be
                        accepted in rejecting parents.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: No, I don't think so. I can only recall Maria Catorus with that particular
                    one. There was a statement there of Grace Stone's who was the mother of the
                    child whose paternity had been in question, where Jim Jones or her husband had
                    been the father of this child. She maintained that her husband was gay and made
                    other allegations against him. She said that Jim Jones was in fact the father of
                    her child, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But did you find anything that would have led anyone to
                        understand what this White Night exercise was really about and that it was
                        really a danger?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Well, by this time the young woman whose name slips my mind, who had gone
                    back to the United States in the middle of summer had pretty much made all these
                    accusations to the press, so they were indeed known. I guess our principal
                    problem was that there were accusations of this type from both sides. And who do
                    you believe? The concerned relatives had put out a brochure alleging a lot of
                    things, for example, that we knew were not true. That the whole Jonestown
                    complex was fenced in by barbed wire and patrolled by guards. Well, you could
                    see that there was no fence. But the fact of the matter was that they really
                    didn't need it. There were all kinds of allegations that there were automatic
                    weapons up there. In fact, the FBI recovered some 30 weapons and they were the
                    usual type of thing that you might find in any type of these farm households
                    that had moved to People's Temple. They were shotguns and 22s and maybe a 03 or
                    two, a few pistols, Saturday night specials and things like that. Yet again,
                    that was all that was necessary. They had no need for automatic weapons or much
                    else either, given the control they had there.</p>
                <p>What developed was a pattern of elaborate duplicity which became apparent when
                    you read over these things. There was a series of letter that were written to
                    creditors in the United States. They handled this very nicely. Apparently when
                    the people came to Guyana they were possibly told to just forget about any
                    outstanding bills they might have in the United States or they acted on their
                    own and just didn't pay outstanding bills. There were letters from Sears,
                    Roebuck; payments for cars, etc. People's Temple simply wrote them back thanking
                    them for the letter to Mr. so-and-so and stating that he was no longer a member
                    of the People's Temple and had returned to the United States and his last
                    address was such and such.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>So, we got a good idea of the incredible organization of this thing. There were
                    also reports of meetings. Every meeting at the Embassy had been fully reported
                    by two or three people. Meetings with the Ambassador, with me, with the consular
                    section. As I said earlier they did quite a credible job at least with the one
                    or two I saw that dealt with me directly. They were pretty accurate as to what I
                    had said. These were meetings not only dealing directly with Embassy people but
                    also with third persons such as the Guyanese Ambassador to Washington who had
                    been shacked up with one of these people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Coming back—I'm trying to chop you down a bit because of
                        time constraints—how did you feel after going through this? Did you feel
                        that you should have known?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: No, definitely not. What we thought might come to pass was that the
                    People's Temple might well disintegrate itself, in which case we would have a
                    terrific problem of getting people back. The big question always came back to
                    the fact did these people in Jonestown kill themselves and commit suicide or
                    were they forced to do so? Obviously under any criteria of any common law,
                    children can't commit suicide voluntarily, so there is no question that the
                    children were murdered. And they were murdered by their parents and their
                    relatives. But on balance I am still convinced that the great majority of these
                    people did in fact kill themselves. There were only one or two there, including
                    Jim Jones, with bullet wounds. Some had injections of cyanide, but there was no
                    way of telling whether these injections had been forced or not. Also they had
                    swallowed cyanide as well in many cases. So you didn't know whether these had
                    been injections to hurry on what they had already started or what have you. And
                    I was struck a year or two later by an article in the New York Times Magazine
                    that reported on a woman who very much regretted that she had not been there.
                    She had been in the United States for some reason but she still regretted that
                    she had not been there to take her own life with her colleagues.</p>
                <p>So I think my personal thing, my biggest mental anguish came from the children.
                    These were children I had watched playing and had played with just hours before
                    they were to be killed by their parents.</p>
                <p>As to what we could have done—what got lost in the shuffle to some extent was how
                    very carefully under the Ambassador's instructions the Embassy had tried to
                    maintain a proper neutral approach to the whole thing. There had been, before my
                    arrival there, an American Women's Club and the People's Temple had thought this
                    was a good access to the Embassy apparently and sent a whole bunch of women over
                    there to join it. This wasn't quite what the American Women's Club of the
                    Embassy was suppose to be and so in fact the Ambassador had dissolved it rather
                    than get into confrontation as to which American women could belong to it. On
                    another occasion the Marine Guards were approached by the People's Temple saying
                    let's have some activities together. Let's have a baseball game or something.
                    The Ambassador put his foot down immediately and said in no way would they have
                    anything to do with these people.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>The People's Temple came to us one time, I don't remember while I was there or
                    not, I think it was, and complained to us that they were being subjected to
                    unreasonable search and harassment at customs. The consular officer at a staff
                    meeting said he didn't know what was going on there but there was no question
                    that all of a sudden everything was being searched. Mind you these people would
                    come from the United States with everything they owned, with their whole
                    household effects, short of the furniture. It was like you went down to your
                    basement and cleaned everything out—tools, the spare parts of stuff you hadn't
                    needed—and it all arrived. Dick McCoy our consular officer said he didn't know
                    why this was the case but maybe he should go down to customs to see if he could
                    help them out. The Ambassador said he would not do any such thing. This is a
                    Guyanese law. Interestingly enough what the Embassy didn't know at that time was
                    that the Guyanese authorities had been alerted by Interpol that there had been
                    rumors of illegal shipments coming in. Nobody thought to tell the Embassy this.
                    But this was, we learned later, the reason for the Guyanese search of all this
                    stuff, which I might add turned up nothing.</p>
                <p>On the other side we had the concerned relatives and those who hadn't written us
                    saying you know I want my child back, why can't the Embassy get my child back
                    for me? In most of these cases the children were either of age or had their
                    legal guardians with them at Jonestown.</p>
                <p>We also recovered the guest book that people were asked to sign at
                    Jonestown—including myself, I might add. Fortunately I had been wary enough to
                    say that I had had a very interesting day in my visit to them in the spring. But
                    there were many people there including some parents of Jonestown young adults
                    who had written absolutely glowing reports of this paradise in the jungle.</p>
                <p>We had talked about Jonestown shortly after I had made my first visit there. We
                    had sent a telegram into the Department saying that as nearly as we could tell
                    Jonestown was a state within a state and the Guyanese law did not seem to apply
                    there. And we suggested that the Embassy be permitted to go in and make demarche
                    to the Guyanese government that they should more accurately monitor what was
                    going on there. The Department had sent us back something that said no we think
                    that would be interference in Guyanese affairs. The Embassy was criticized for
                    this subsequently for not following this up and insisting on it. It had been our
                    original telegram marked for the Assistant Secretary and that of Consular
                    Affairs, both of whom may have said they never saw it, just routinely
                    answered...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But that would have been standard practice. I speak as a
                        retired consular officer. You keep your hands off these things.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>DWYER: Well, that is true. And we were told simply later that we were just
                    looking for a way to cover our ass, which I am still indignant about. But in
                    fact, we simply did not have the authority, or the facility for that matter, to
                    make an investigation of American citizens. It was against our law.</p>
                <p>As for the tragedy itself, and Congressman Ryan. The other official member of the
                    party, Jim Scholart, asked me before we went up there, whether I thought there
                    was any danger to the congressman. I said I didn't think so. We had gone up
                    there several times and we had had no problems. I said if the congressman has a
                    modicum of good sense, you know is not standing up and denouncing these people
                    or Jim Jones, which of course he did not do, I didn't see any reason why this
                    should be any different from any other trip. There are literally dozens of
                    things that could have changed what happened. If we couldn't have gotten the
                    airplane we couldn't have gone. If Jones had remained adamant in his position
                    that we could not come in, the congressman would have had a nice little press
                    session at the airport showing him futilely knocking at the gates, and we
                    probably would have gotten back in the airplane and gone home. If we didn't have
                    all the press and the television cameras maybe that would have made a
                    difference. But needless to say I agonized over these things, not for days, but
                    for months and even years. But I finally convinced myself that there was no
                    single thing that the Embassy should have done, or that I should have done.
                    There were many things that we could have done that would have changed it but
                    only in hindsight.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking back on this, what happened to both you and to
                        John Burke as a result of this. Without going into the details, because this
                        is in the press and in the congressional hearings, what was the reaction in
                        the long term of the Department for you and John Burke over this—supportive,
                        non-supportive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Well, I can't be sure what effect these things have on a promotion panel
                    as against other factors. I stayed on in Georgetown. John Burke left the
                    following spring or so and I was Charg� again for a few months until the next
                    man came along. Maybe I should have gone back to Washington to shout a little
                    bit on my own behalf. I am not sure that would have done anything or not, but
                    perhaps.</p>
                <p>We had two investigations. One an internal one from the Department of State where
                    we had two senior officers come down and interview everyone and make a report.
                    The conclusion of their report was that all junior officers should have
                    psychiatric training so that they would be able to recognize these things. That
                    was irritating. The other was a House Foreign Affairs Committee team that came
                    down there—four or five of them. I made a mistake there because they talked to
                    me 8 or 10 hours solid and I wished now I had broken it up into 4 or 5 hour
                    segments. I would have perhaps been more alert to it, but you know basically I
                    had nothing to hide. That report was sealed and I don't know whether it is out
                    yet or not.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>As far as to what happened subsequently, the Department mailed down to me by
                    surface mail a little plaque, a little brown piece of wood with a little strip
                    of metal, award for valor on it, not quite mounted squarely, which I thought was
                    kind of typical.</p>
                <p>John Burke went back to one or two jobs including Deputy Assistant Secretary for
                    Administration for the program of reviewing history. I will let John speak for
                    himself, but from my own estimation of his capabilities and how well he
                    conducted himself in Georgetown, I suspect that he would have gone on to more
                    senior things had it not been for Jonestown.</p>
                <p>I heard almost nothing from the America Republics Bureau, ARA, except a very nice
                    letter from the Assistant Secretary that accompanied my little plaque eight or
                    nine months later. When it came time to move on, my wife said she wanted to go
                    somewhere nice, please. We had been through Africa, Syria, and Bulgaria. My wife
                    said she had never been to a post where she could go to a grocery store. So I
                    said okay it will be your choice this time. Actually we went to Martinique which
                    happened to be one of the most popular posts around for officers of my grade at
                    that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this was in a way a recognition...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: I would say it was more like a nice handshake, goodby. What effect this
                    has on promotion panels, who knows. I had the problem of coming to the senior
                    threshold when it was terribly crowded with people looking to be promoted. I
                    suspect all things being equal that if I were being considered for a promotion
                    or an assignment along with another guy and we were exactly the same, the fact
                    that I had been there in charge of a congressional delegation that I brought
                    back in body bags with 900 odd Americans dead, was not going to do my career any
                    good, obviously.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You stayed in Martinique how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>DWYER: We stayed in Martinique for three years. All this time I was commuting to
                    San Francisco for Larry Layton's trial. The Department by that time had simply
                    washed their hands of me and of Jonestown—couldn't give a damn about what was
                    happening. Layton went through two trials. Part of the defense in his first
                    trial was again the CIA thing. The judge excused the jury from the court room,
                    but permitted the press to stay and allowed the defense council to make the same
                    accusation that had been made in the press and of course I was immediately
                    mobbed by the press outside and neither confirmed nor denied. I asked for and
                    received specific instructions from the Department as to what I was to say, but
                    it was like pulling teeth. The second trial, the first one was a hung jury, a
                    year later—I might add that there was nobody from the Department at this trial
                    and I was still rather naive. I was concerned about the reputation of the
                    Department. I was personally concerned about my own reputation and that of the
                    Embassy, but I was equally concerned about the Department. Before the second
                    trial I wrote two letters to the Legal Advisor saying I was going out there and
                    this time if I get asked the question about CIA and what have you I was simply
                    going to say nope and I want you to be aware of that. Do you have any comments
                    on that? I received no reply at all. Finally the day before I went out there I
                    sent a registered letter and said this is what I am going to say. If you people
                    have any problem with this let me know. I got out to San Francisco and finally
                    something came in by fax from the Legal Department very apologetic and in effect
                    saying they had no objection under these conditions for Dwyer to say that, but
                    the damn thing never came up.</p>
                <p>What happens, as you well know, in the Department, people change assignments
                    every two or three years. Within a period of two or three years this was ancient
                    history and there was nobody around who remembered it. There was nobody around
                    who cared, except those of us directly concerned. So you certainly felt that
                    anything to be done to protect one's reputation should be done by one's self,
                    don't depend upon the United States government or the Department of State to do
                    it because their interests are not the same as your own.</p>
                <p>In effect, I think I came out reasonably well. I was urged by several friends,
                    including a lawyer or two, to sue a few of these guys for libel. But that was
                    the last thing I wanted—to prolong this thing. After seven or eight years I was
                    beginning to think that there was nothing left of this but a box of papers that
                    I haven't had the heart to go through sitting in my basement—maybe we will
                    forget about it. Yet somehow one way or another it always comes up.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We have been on this a major part of the interview, but at
                        the same time we hit a lot of the other parts of your career. I might just
                        add a little footnote on this. Just after the Jonestown thing, of course,
                        all of us in the Foreign Service trade, particularly those of us in the
                        consular business, were immediately buzzing about this thing. I got a
                        telegram from the consul general in Seoul, Korea saying “I want you to find
                        out what the Unification Church of Reverend Moon is doing.” This was because
                        it was one of these cult outfits which had multiple marriages and all sorts
                        of things and was big in the United States and they wanted to make sure that
                        all of a sudden these so-called moonies, who were mostly Korean, I mean
                        there weren't really any Americans in Korea, but they wanted to cover their
                        tail to make sure there was not going to be a mass suicide of moonies. I
                        think we went over, kicked a few tires and slammed a few doors, but there
                        wasn't anything to it. But this was happening all over.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Well and there were a couple of cases in which there was in fact some
                    concern. There was one colony in the Caribbean, where a charismatic leader and
                    all sorts of strange things was going on. There was another one in Brazil run by
                    a German that was equally weird. But there wasn't anything around that had a
                    thousand Americans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in a way, at least historically, about the end of
                        the major commune movements.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: No, not at all. Ironically the next major one was to feature as a bit
                    player Congressman Ryan's daughter. And that was the Bogwan out west where the
                    commune eventually broke up. The Bogwan, the guy with the 36 Rolls Royces and
                    what have you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Antelope Valley, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Yes, that's right. A very devoted follower of his was one of Congressman
                    Ryan's daughters. The Ryan family had been awarded a reasonably substantial sum
                    from the People's Temple. I think the daughters got $30,000 or $50,000 a piece,
                    or something like that. I remember thinking at the time—Jim Jones you just
                    bought the Bogwan half a new Rolls Royce. But there we were again and this was a
                    case where Ryan's two daughters were on television on one of the late night talk
                    shows debating this. I can't remember the names now, but the one daughter has
                    been very active against cults and this was a conversation with her sister who
                    was a member of this cult. She was obviously terribly frustrated. She could not
                    communicate with her sister. This emotionally effected me because this was just
                    the kind of people we were dealing with in Guyana. To think that the daughter of
                    this man who had been murdered down there when asked one time—and quoted in the
                    press—if the Bogwan had told her to murder someone what would you do, had said
                    that she hoped she would have the strength to carry out the Bogwan's
                    instructions.</p>

                <p>I just have a hard time going back and looking at the Embassy operations there

                    against these people irrespective of their rights as American citizens, if we
                    had tried to do whatever we could to encourage these people to come back to the
                    United States, or something, I don't see that there was a great deal that we

                <p>DWYER: There comes a time in any Foreign Service career that if you stick around

                        effectiveness. You can do what you think may be right, but will it be
                        effective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Well, yes. Can you accomplish anything at all? But there were such simple
                    things to do. Had I not sat on my administrative officer's rear end and told him
                    to get out and find me airplanes, he probably wouldn't have come up with one and
                    that would have been that right there. The congressman and his aide were anxious
                    to get down to another Caribbean island for the weekend and I don't think they
                    would have stood around any longer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Dick, did you retire from Martinique?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DWYER: Well, I spent three years in Martinique, a delightful place. Martinique
                    has consular jurisdiction over Guadeloupe, and French Guiana plus their
                    dependent islands so it is an enormous consular district. And it was a nice post
                    because I reported directly to Washington rather than to Embassy Paris. It was
                    under ARA. So I had my own little post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You retired when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>DWYER: I came back and retired about six months later in the spring of '84. By
                    this time the handwriting was on the wall and I knew I was going to have to
                    retire. One nice thing about the last few months in the Foreign Service, if
                    somebody else is paying you you get all kinds of jobs offered you. So I went
                    into Caribbean Affairs which is a large office in ARA—I mean 14 tiny countries
                    or so. I was deputy director and acting director of that for almost the last
                    nine months. It was a good catharsis because I learned a few things. I was not
                    about to become an elderly desk officer once again. I had a call from a guy
                    named Constantine Menges, who was new in the White House. We had been trying to
                    get our prime ministers in to see the President in an order that had been very
                    carefully selected in Caribbean Affairs. I got a call from this guy who was new
                    over there, he was later to become somewhat better known because of his
                    relations with Ollie North. Constantine said that they had agreed to recommend
                    to the President to let the Prime Minister of Antigua call on him. I said,
                    “Antigua?” What it was was that we had a political ambassador in Barbados who
                    covered Antigua. You know the old Foreign Service saying, “Every ambassador gets
                    three bites.” Well this was one of his bites. He had called up his political
                    cronies in the White House and asked as a favor to him personally whether they
                    could get him in to see the President, so he did. This guy calls up, I think, on
                    Friday afternoon and said he needed briefing papers, etc., etc. because the guy
                    was going to come in in a week, or something, and he wanted them in his office
                    by the next morning, Saturday. I said, “Sorry, Constantine, my Antigua desk
                    officer is on leave, we have a Grenada crisis [I might add that in between this
                    I went down and served as Charg� at Antigua for a couple of weeks during the
                    Grenada crisis because they needed someone more senior down there. The guy who
                    was Charg� wasn't there because his father had died. So I went down.] Anyway,
                    the Grenada thing was still being wrapped up. I said that there was no way I
                    could get the information by Saturday, but would see what I could do about
                    Tuesday morning. He said, “Do you know who this is?” I said, “I know who this
                    is, I just can't spell your last name.” He spelled it out and said, “I want it
                    by tomorrow morning.” I said, “You are not going to get it tomorrow morning.” As
                    a young desk officer I would have worked all night somehow to do this. But there
                    was no reason for this little thing to get over there on Saturday morning. The
                    next week I went and picked up the Prime Minister and we went over to the White
                    House. The briefing papers that we finally did were largely there as written and
                    everything went well. But I decided that I was too old and too mean to be going
                    around with these bureaucrats.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>And you know we had these little crisis. We had another one, there was a guy who
                    manufactured spectacles in Texas and a heavy contributor to the Republican
                    Party. He had been promised an embassy. So they were going to give him Belize.
                    Well, Belize is not exactly the pearl of the Antilles. Belize looked over his
                    record and said we won't have him. So then they said you have to find somewhere
                    else. So they are going to send him to Guyana. And the Guyanese were just
                    dragging their feet on this thing. And, as any Foreign Service Officer knows,
                    the political appointments are handled by the Presidential Staff in the
                    Department—these are political, the Agr�ment Channel telegrams are not widely
                    distributed, etc. So anyway, it became obvious that they really didn't want the
                    guy but they didn't want to say no just out of politeness. I was bugging our
                    Embassy in Guyana to go in and talk to Rashly Taxson who is the Foreign
                    Minister. Just get informal word that if they are not going to take this guy let
                    us know—no formal reply to our note is necessary, just say no. So that is what
                    they did. The Embassy sent it back through the Agr�ment Channel and I thought
                    this was all settled. A couple of months later this guy out in Texas called and
                    said, “What is happening? I have sold everything and we are ready to go to
                    Guyana.” Nobody had told him. He ended up in Africa replacing a good career
                    officer, a friend of mine.</p>
