                <p>ROBERT E. SERVICE</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: February 24, 1998</p>
                <p>Copyright 2000 ADST</p>
                <p>Q: We'll start at the beginning. Could you tell me when and where you were born
                    and something about your family?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: I was born in Peiping, China, as it was then called, in February 1937.
                    My father was a language student at the Embassy in Peking, having entered the
                    Foreign Service in 1933 as a clerk in Yunnan-fu (now Kunming), and then been
                    transferred up to Peiping in 1936.</p>
                <p>Q: We have an extensive oral history in our collection and also at the University
                    of California at Berkeley that was done by the Bancroft Library there, of your
                    father. How long were you in China?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: My mother, my sister and I were there until late 1940 when it was
                    decided that the wives and children of American officials should leave the
                    country. We were evacuated and went back to the U.S. I haven't been back since.
                    My father stayed in China through the war. He left in 1945.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go in the States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: We went to Berkeley, California, where my mother's parents lived. Her
                    father had been an Army officer and retired in the mid-1930s. They built a house
                    in Berkeley. They were good enough to take us in, the three of us, my mother,
                    sister, and me. We spent the war years in Berkeley.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you were eight years old, I guess, when the war was
                        over?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes, eight and a half.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess you had just started school in Berkeley.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>SERVICE: I did kindergarten through third grade in Berkeley.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then, where to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: My father came back and we moved back to Washington. We were there for
                    about a year. Then we went to New Zealand for a couple of years, and then back
                    to Washington, then to India, and then back to Washington. There were other
                    complications I can get into if you want me to.</p>
                <p>Q: I think it's covered pretty much on that side, in your father's account.
                    Focusing in on you, how did this sit, as far as going to New Zealand, India and
                    all? How did you react to this moving around?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: I loved it. Every place was fascinating, is fascinating. I think when
                    you are young, you are more adaptable than when you get older. I certainly never
                    found any problem in adapting. Each country was an adventure. In New Zealand, I
                    went to a New Zealand school. My father was the second man in the Legation. Many
                    of the children of the Embassy went to private schools. My parents had, I
                    consider, the fortunate idea of sending me to a public school. I spent two years
                    there. The Ambassador in those days lived out on a sheep station, about 40 miles
                    from Wellington. It was called Fernside. He used to invite us out periodically,
                    to hunt rabbits and hares, and things. It was awfully exciting for a boy who was
                    nine, ten, eleven years old.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about India?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: India, we went when I was 13. We were headed to Calcutta. We took a boat
                    from Seattle. My father never got there. The rest of us went on. He was called
                    back on account of charges being made by Senator Joseph McCarthy. My mother, my
                    sister, my brother, and I went on. His post had changed from Calcutta to New
                    Delhi. So, we went to New Delhi and spent a year and one-half there, waiting for
                    my father to come, before the government said that we should head back. Loy
                    Henderson was the Ambassador to India at that time. I attended a missionary
                    school called Woodstock in Mussoorie. It was before the days of the American
                    school at New Delhi. I had a fascinating experience again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you pretty well indoctrinated into the Foreign
                        Service? mean, how did you feel about the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: It was the only thing I knew. The aspect of traveling, seeing, getting
                    to know various countries, different cultures, was very absorbing.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then, you went back to New York?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: We came back to Washington from India. Then, my father was fired from
                    the Foreign Service. That was in 1951. Meanwhile, I had applied for, and won, a
                    scholarship to go to England for a year. So, I did that from 1952 to 1953, while
                    my family lived in New York. I came back for my senior year of high school in
                    New York City.</p>
                <p>Q: Tell me about 1952 to 1953 in England. Where did you go?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: I went to Magdalen College School in Oxford on a program that was set up
                    by something called the Kinsman Trust. It had been established by wealthy
                    Britons who had sent their children to the United States during World War II.
                    Many friends, or relatives, or what not, invited children to come to stay with
                    them. As a way of showing gratitude, they set up a foundation. I suppose this
                    was mainly for descendants or relatives or people who helped them. But, by the
                    time I came along, it was open to a larger range. So, I applied for it, and won,
                    and went to Magdalen College School for a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find the British system different?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes, but don't forget, I had been in New Zealand, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right. Also, India.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Well, India was at an American school, but there were some people who
                    were British there, too. It was not all that different, or if it was, it didn't
                    bother me particularly. I remember things like, for example, most of my fellow
                    students had been studying French for five years. Of course, I was barely
                    starting. In French class, I sort of worked by myself in a corner. I wasn't
                    really capable of keeping up with them. But I managed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you finish high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: I finished high school at Forest Hills High, New York City. My parents
                    lived in Queens, Kew Gardens, and that was the nearest high school. I did one
                    year there. Each of my high school years was spent at a different school, in
                    three countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the New York school?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>SERVICE: Well, it was a 3,300 person school, quite different from the small
                    schools in India and England. Coming in during my senior year to a class of
                    1,100 was a little difficult, but there are always friends. I certainly managed.
                    One of my best friends was another marginal sort, a person named Peter Heliczer.
                    He was of mixed Austrian/Italian descent. He got kicked out of Harvard after his
                    freshman year for taking something from the Fogg because he thought it beautiful
                    and wanted it on his dorm mantel. Later he jumped off a ship in Barcelona
                    harbor, but was fished out. I've lost track of Peter. I guess the point is that
                    even though I think I had a normal sort of youth, I probably didn't in American
                    terms. I was an outsider when I was in the U.S., and also of course in places
                    like New Zealand and England. India was different because it was an American
                    school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You graduated from high school in 1955?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: 1954.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: I went to Oberlin College, where both my parents had gone,and where my
                    sister was a year ahead of me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oberlin not only had liberal, but also very strong
                        missionarties, didn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes. Oberlin graduates had been active in China since before the 20th
                    century. One of the central pieces of architecture is the Martyrs' Arch, I
                    believe, which commemorates those who died in the Boxer Rebellion. There had
                    been an “Oberlin in China” until 1949. When I was at Oberlin there was the
                    Oberlin in Shansi Committee, which I've served on, and which chose a number of
                    seniors each year to teach in Asia. At that time it was not possible to go to
                    China and so they went to India, or Taiwan, or Japan. Eventually they returned
                    to China. There was a strong China influence and also a strong missionary
                    influence of one type or another. One of my classmates had also been in my class
                    in the missionary school in India.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At Oberlin, what courses were you taking?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: I majored in economics. This was not out of tremendous enthusiasm, but
                    it seemed like a useful thing to take. I took a lot of history and political
                    science. I also took a sprinkling of other humanities and the required science
                    course and the required language course, and a couple of English courses.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>Q: What was the campus like during 1954 - 1958? This is what they called, I
                    think, the “Silent 50s,” or something like that, as opposed to the rambunctious
                    '60s.</p>
                <p>SERVICE: I guess it was pretty quiet. There was an issue when I first got there
                    about whether there should be ROTC [Reserve Officer Training Course] on campus.
                    That was resolved by asking them to leave. I think there had just been one, the
                    Air Force. There was a Eugene V. Debs Club and a certain amount of activism. But
                    by comparison to the subsequent decade, it was not much. When I wasn't studying,
                    or with my steady girlfriend, Sue Moldof, I spent a lot of time running track
                    and cross-country. I won the conference mile my junior year. I also worked on
                    the campus newspaper, was on student government one year, and belonged to
                    various other groups or activities. I had a wonderful time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were taking economics, were you pointed toward
                        anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Not really. It wasn't until my senior year that I thought somewhat about
                    going to law school. I went and visited a number of them. Instead I went to
                    Princeton, to the Woodrow Wilson School, for two years. At that time I had
                    pretty much decided I wanted to give the Foreign Service a try. I took the exam
                    my second year at Princeton and passed. I did my six months in the Army and
                    entered the Foreign Service in early 1961.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At Princeton, was it a different view of sort of
                        thinternational world that you were getting than at Oberlin, did you
                        find?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: I never thought that. It never occurred to me. I would be surprised if
                    it were very different. Oberlin, despite its liberal reputation, was a fairly
                    sophisticated place.</p>
                <p>Q: I was just thinking that it has an international reputation but more of a
                    missionary tinge to it as opposed to Princeton, which would have been more the
                    Eastern establishment. I was just wondering.</p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes, but I think at Oberlin in the 1950s the percentage of students who
                    came out of a missionary/religious or left/liberal backgrounds was probably no
                    more than five, perhaps eight percent. A lot of kids came from New York City or
                    other eastern metropolises. And, of course, I was a graduate student at
                    Princeton, not an undergraduate. Between the backgrounds and outlooks of the
                    undergraduates at Oberlin and the graduate students at Princeton, I did not
                    notice any great differences.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>Q: I was just wondering, both at Oberlin and at Princeton, what were you getting
                    as far as the Soviet Union was concerned? This was the major preoccupation, I
                    think, with the United States, during this period.</p>
                <p>SERVICE: I don't remember clearly what the perspective was at Oberlin. There had
                    been a number of attempts by students at Oberlin to become knowledgeable about
                    Eastern Europe. There was a sense that these were captive countries and that
                    they were really more like us than the Soviet Union. Therefore, we ought to try
                    to open up lines of communication. The editor of the college newspaper and who
                    later became a Unitarian Minister, Clark Olson, went to Poland and brought back
                    information to the campus. There was sort of a warm feeling about these kinds of
                    relations with Eastern Block countries. Much the same was true at Princeton. We
                    actually had a couple of Russians. I once moderated a debate between Russian and
                    an American, each defending and extolling his system. There was an effort to
                    build bridges of understanding and break down the hysterical negativeness that
                    existed in some parts of American public opinion.</p>
                <p>Q: I was wondering - in your decision to go into the Foreign Service, your father
                    was almost the China hand who was singled out by McCarthy and associates. Did
                    this leave any, sort of family feeling, that you don't mess with the Foreign
                    Service, public service and all? Was that there?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: There was never any of that. I think that my parents' feeling was that
                    public service was a good thing. Before my father, his father had been a YMCA
                    [Young Men's Christian Association] missionary in China. My mother's father was
                    a colonel in the Army Corps of Engineers. There was support for public service
                    on both sides. What had happened to my father was the result of politics and
                    mass hysteria, an occupational risk but not a reason for avoiding such work. It
                    could be very unfair to people, my father notably, but it was not the general
                    rule in our society. Therefore, I should not generalize too far from what had
                    happened in his case.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find that when you were in school that the whole McCarthy thing was
                    being fought generally by the liberal, or whatever you call it, the Eastern
                    establishment? There was not strong support for the McCarthy movement or
                    whatever you want to call it, for the right wing within the eastern
                    establishment, or within the liberal arts schools. Did you find people trying to
                    pick you up to recruit you into leading things, this sort of thing?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: Not really. I was too young for that, perhaps. I was 13 when McCarthy
                    first named Dad, and 17 when McCarthy was censured. During that period, it very
                    seldom came up in my contacts with other people. I do not remember any
                    aggressiveness or antagonism toward me, toward my family, toward my father,
                    based on that. Maybe people felt that it wouldn't be polite to take a strident
                    position, face-to-face. It was almost a non-issue, other than that it affected
                    my father and my family. But not in my daily life.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>Q: Also, you're nine years younger than I am. I was born in 1928. When I was in
                    college, the McCarthy thing was just beginning to hit, and it hit a couple of
                    our professors. I think we were of the age where we were more affected. By the
                    time you were coming along, it was over, in a way, or at least it had
                    dissipated.</p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes. By the time I got out of Oberlin, McCarthy's star waon the
                    wane.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came into the Foreign Service in 1961?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You took an oral exam. Do you remember anything about the
                        oraexam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: I remember a few questions. I remember that one of the people on the
                    panel was named Farnsworth. It was a three-man panel, all men in those days. It
                    was not particularly traumatic or terrifying. After I finished, they told me I
                    had passed. I don't remember much more than that about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You took what was called Basic Officer's course, A-100
                        course, ait is known now. What was your class like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: There were 30 people in it, of which, one was a woman. The average age
                    was probably 27, 28. I was among the youngest. There was a wide variety of
                    backgrounds. We had one officer who had been a musician at the Milwaukee
                    Symphony orchestra. The orchestra took a trip abroad, and he felt that he would
                    like to do more internationally, so he came into the Foreign Service. Out of 30,
                    there are probably five or six that I felt particularly close to and have kept
                    up with, to some extent, over the years, but not more than that. It was a
                    typical class. There were no particularly bright stars. I think eventually three
                    out of thirty of us became Ambassadors, which is probably about average.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you come in, in 1961?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: In January, 1961.</p>
                <p>Q: In 1961, John F. Kennedy became President. Many of the people I interviewed
                    were caught up in the spirit of public service, and the Kennedy ethos that “We
                    will go out and do things,” and all that. Does that strike a resonant chord with
                    you or your group?</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>SERVICE: There was some of that. We were proud to be coming in at the same time
                    this young and inspiring President was taking over. Because we started in the
                    same month he took the oath of office, maybe we thought we were the class that
                    would be most closely identified with him. but it wasn't something we talked
                    about or something that we felt particularly pumped up about. We were excited
                    starting off a new career. We had all signed up before we knew who was going to
                    be the President, and we were looking forward to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any efforts by any of the new people in the
                        Kennedadministration to make contact with this brand new class coming
                        in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: I don't remember any, although three members in our class went up to see
                    Fulbright. He decided he wanted to see some of the entering Foreign Service
                    officers. I guess the Senate has to confirm new recruits, new officers. He said,
                    “Let me see a few of these people.” We had one person who was from Arkansas, Guy
                    Gwynn, and they sent him up. I have forgotten who the other two were. They
                    didn't send me up though, nor the son of U. Alexis Johnson, who was also in our
                    class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They always give you the choice of where you want to go.
                        Wherdid you want to go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: I asked for Latin America. I didn't have a world language, any language,
                    except English. I had a Cuban roommate during my first year at Princeton. Of
                    course, that was when Castro was coming in. There was a lot of excitement.
                    Castro came to Washington and then up to Princeton. My friend, Victor Morales,
                    was very much swept up in all that, and perhaps a bit rubbed off on me. I asked
                    to be taught Spanish and then go somewhere I could use it. In those days, they
                    still had the system where they called the whole class into the auditorium and
                    read out names and where you were going. My name was followed by Barranquilla,
                    Colombia. I didn't go there, however, because later they switched my assignment
                    to Managua.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: From 1961 to 1963.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you describe the situation in Nicaragua during
                        thiperiod?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Nicaragua had been run by the Somoza family since the 1930s. The old
                    man, Tacho he was called, had been assassinated in 1956. His two sons, Luis and
                    Anastasio, Jr., known as Tachito, took over. When I got there, Luis was
                    President and Tachito was head of the National Guard. People didn't really trust
                    Tachito, but they gave Luis the benefit of the doubt. They thought he was
                    sincerely trying to modernize and democratize the country, to move away from the
                    family dictatorship that it had been. That was true all the time I was there.
                    Things seemed to be moving in a generally positive direction. Shortly
                    thereafter, Luis died and Tachito became more involved, and the situation
                    deteriorated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why were there reservations about Tachito?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Tachito, much more than Luis, was in the Latin American caudillo mold.
                    You prove you are a leader by being more ruthless than the next fellow, by being
                    willing to use intimidation and force. In that he was like his father. Luis was
                    more liberal, more democratic. Or at least that is how it appeared to us.</p>

                        iNicaragua in your eyes, as you saw it, in 1961?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: You mean the poverty, and things like that?</p>

                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: The country was not the poorest in Central America, but one of the
                    poorer ones. It had more land per capita than some. It did not have the Indian
                    problem that Guatemala has. Everybody was pretty much mestizo, except for the
                    people on the coast, who were black, primarily. There was a fairly small,
                    educated, elite in the cities. The rest of the country was pretty poor. There
                    were not huge slums, but there was a very sharp drop off in living standards
                    once we got beyond the urban elite. It was at about the time I was there,
                    although we were not aware of it at the time, that the Sandinistas started
                    organizing in the mountainous areas. At first they were just a handful of
                    people. I was not aware of their existence until many years later.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: They were rather limited. There were a few Cubans in the country,
                    supposedly refugees from Castro, but we checked to make sure they were not
                    serving as conduits for sending machinery to Cuba. This was after the Bay of
                    Pigs and after we had broken relations with Cuba. There were a few American
                    cotton farmers, and the Blue brothers had started a cocao plantation. United
                    Fruit was trying to grow bananas on the Pacific Coast side of the country. They
                    had pretty much abandoned Nicaragua in the 1920s and 1930s. Now they were
                    looking for a new land free of the various diseases that affect bananas. But,
                    overall, our economic and commercial stake was not great.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: I was young and single. I spent most of my time with young people
                    outside the embassy. It was an international group but included a number of
                    Nicaraguans who had spent some time studying in the States. Marta Molina and
                    Frances Urbina Somoza (a distant cousin of Luis and Tachito) were the girls I
                    knew best. We used to do things on weekends together. We would go off and
                    explore one of the islands in the lakes, or go to a waterfall, or go to the
                    beach, or one thing or another. I was invited occasionally for diplomatic
                    functions within the U.S. Embassy, and to the Ambassador's house periodically. A
                    number of us from the Embassy played bridge every Monday night at the Club
                    Nejapa, Nicaragua's one country club. It was a duplicate game. Two of the
                    regulars from the Embassy were the administrative officer, Jack Baxter, and his
                    wife. Both were killed when a light plane crashed. We had a visitor from
                    Washington who wanted to visit something on the Gulf coast of the country. Two
                    small planes were used and there were extra spaces, so the Baxters decided to go
                    along. Flying out they went in separate planes, but coming back, because it was
                    bridge night, they both took the first plane to depart. It never made it. They
                    had two small children, girls, who became instant orphans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Ambassador while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Aaron Brown. His wife's name was Dorothy. Aaron's previous job was head
                    of personnel. He had earlier been DCM [deputy chief of mission] in Bogota. Aaron
                    was a New Englander, rather reserved. But he was always very good to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What type of work were you doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>SERVICE: I started off in the Economic Section. Actually, I was sort of the
                    Commercial Officer. It was a two-man section. I had a very good Nicaraguan named
                    Juan Sierro, who did most of the work. Then, the head of the section left and
                    they had some trouble replacing him. I was head of that section for about nine
                    months. It was a great experience for a first term FSO-8 [Foreign Service
                    officer, rank 8] officer. I used to go to the Ambassador's staff meeting every
                    morning. The usual attendees were the political officer, the economic officer,
                    and the DCM. We discussed what was going on, and had arguments from time to
                    time. I remember one time when the national railroad wanted a loan from the
                    Ex-Im [Export-Import] Bank and the embassy was asked for its opinion. The DCM,
                    Lou Blanchard, was all for granting the loan. I argued that the railroad had no
                    future and we should not encourage it. I don't remember how it came out, or
                    whether I was proved right or wrong by subsequent events, but it was rather
                    heady stuff for a young officer to be arguing with those twenty or more years
                    his senior. At one point I did an airgram on the wealth of the Somozas. I think
                    I concluded that they were not as wealthy as popular opinion imagined. For a
                    number of years, officers who followed me to Managua or worked on Nicaraguan
                    affairs would mention having read that airgram.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were no attempted coups or earthquakes, or anything
                        likthat, while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: There were a lot of earthquakes, but nothing major. In those days the
                    major earthquake referent was that of 1931. Such and such was before or after
                    that. Now when anybody talks about before or after the earthquake, they are
                    talking about the earthquake of 1972 or '73. The rains came and the rains went.
                    The heat stayed most of the time. It was a very pretty country, but not
                    particularly healthy. I got hepatitis and also shingles, but neither badly
                    enough to keep me away from the office for more than a day or two.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was the feeling about the economy in Nicaragua
                        at thatime? Was it . . . for its size and place a viable economy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: I suppose one would have to say yes. But there was a big movement at
                    that time to form various Central America organizations, a Central American
                    common market, a Central American Bank, a Central American this and a Central
                    America that. USAID [United States Agency for International Development] put a
                    lot of manpower and money into supporting those things, as did the multilateral
                    banks. People thought this would be the path to a better future. The five
                    countries would get together and work together, rather than each try to
                    duplicate what the other was doing. For example, Central America did not need
                    five plants making tires, or farm machinery, or whatever. They would agree on
                    some rational allocation of industrial projects. In that way all would be better
                    off. All that was still in the formative stage when I was there.</p>

                <p>Q: How about the Alliance for Progress? Was that getting cranked up, at the start
                    of the Kennedy administration?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: Those were the big years for the Alliance. There was enthusiasm,
                    manpower. There were a lot of meetings and seminars on the Alliance for
                    Progress, or this or that aspect of it. It was an exciting time in terms of
                    hopes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any particular aspect of the Alliance for
                        Progress thathe Embassy was pushing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: I don't remember in detail, although I'm sure we thought education,
                    health, and housing deserved high priorities. I know there were a couple
                    programs involving labor unions, and how labor unions could have a larger, more
                    productive role.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Nicaragua a police state at that time or was it pretty
                        open?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: I had very little feeling that it was a police state. Formally, the main
                    street of Managua was called Avenida Roosevelt. But the Nicaraguans always
                    called it Avenida Central, which had been the name before. As you came up
                    Avenida Central from the lakeshore, you went past an Army installation just
                    below where the Presidential palace was. At night time you used to have to turn
                    off your lights when you went past there, so they could see who was driving and
                    how many were in the car. We joked about that a little bit. We said, “What kind
                    of country is this where you can't even go up the main street without having to
                    run into the military?” I can't think of much beyond that. I can remember of
                    almost no cases of the military or police arresting people or beating people.
                    There was very little political oppression that I was aware of. But that was
                    before the days when people who had been mistreated sought out the U.S. Embassy
                    to protect them. We had long been identified with the Somozas. The opposition
                    did not trust us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. Is there anything else you want to say about your tour in
                        Managua?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>A. I should mention that I met my wife there, although we didn't get married
                    until four years later. Karol Kleiner worked in Washington for the Bureau of
                    Labor Statistics and came to Managua writing a report on Labor Law and Practice
                    in Nicaragua. One day I found her sitting in the Commercial Reading Room, for
                    which I was responsible. We went out a few times during the two or three weeks
                    she was there, and then kept in touch until we decided to get married in
                    1967.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Managua in 1963. Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>SERVICE: In 1963, I went to Salvador Bahia, Brazil. I had asked for a place where
                    I could learn another world language. I assumed it would be French, but they
                    sent me to Brazil, which was fine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Brazil from 1963 to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: 1965.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Brazil when you got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: There was a great deal of ferment because those were the last days of
                    Jo�o Goulart. I don't know if you remember, but Goulart had won election as the
                    vice president. The president was Janio Quadros. Quadros was rather eccentric.
                    At one point he up and resigned. This pushed Goulart into the presidency.
                    Goulart had come out of the left, populist side of Brazilian politics, which was
                    then quite effervescent. A lot of people, conservative people, the military,
                    were very worried about having Goulart as President. There were almost continual
                    rumors of plots by the time I got to Rio in December, 1993. The military finally
                    did overthrow Goulart in late March of 1964, shortly after I had gone from Rio
                    to Bahia. I first spent three months in Rio studyinPortuguese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you in Bahia when the overthrow came?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes, I was. I had gone up there about March 20th. I drove from Rio. I
                    think the coup was actually the 31st or so. We had very little idea of what was
                    going on and the radio stations wouldn't say anything. Our communication with
                    the Embassy was not the most effective. I suppose we did call, or could have
                    called. The radio stations played music. We just hunkered down and hoped that it
                    would be all right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just looking at the map.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Bahia is not on it, but it is right there below Recife.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a long way away from everybody.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes, it is about 1,000 miles north of Rio, and probably 40or 500 south
                    of Recife.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Salvador Bahia like? I always hear Salvador
                        Bahia. Wathat a different place than Bahia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: No. Bahia is the state. Salvador da Bahia is the city, the capital. But
                    Bahia is often used for the city, too. I think the full name is Salvador da
                    Bahia de Todos os Santos (Salvador of the Bay of All the Saints). It was the
                    colonial capital. It was the capital until the late 1700s, before the capital
                    moved down to Rio. Bahia at one time had a great deal of money and the Church
                    was very strong. It has a pretty location, up on some hills overlooking the bay.
                    The population is and was quite heavily black, so you had the whole African
                    culture or cultures mixed in with the Portuguese. There are beautiful beaches.
                    It is a very romantic, idyllic, down-at-the-heel kind of place, with a lot of
                    history. They have good food, their own cuisine essentially. I spent a very
                    enjoyable year and a half there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the military make much of an impression from your
                        perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: No, it was a very pacific revolution, if you want to call it that. The
                    Brazilians pride themselves on not spilling blood in these things, and they
                    didn't on this occasion. The opposition came later and became quite intense by
                    the 1970s when the military showed no signs of giving up power. In the
                    beginning, people sort of went on with their business. The civilian governor of
                    the state of Bahia, Antonio Lomonto, Jr. was allowed to continue. Some governors
                    were allowed to continue. Some were not. He apparently was okay. He ran the
                    state but with the military looking over his shoulder. Again, there was very
                    little overt sign of military rule.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: I was Vice Consul. It is amazing what we used to have in the old days.
                    Here was a little place, which we have now closed, where we probably had ten or
                    more Americans full-time. We had three USIA [United States Information Agency]
                    officers, including two bi-natural center directors. We had an Air Force
                    officer. We had an AID officer. We had six State Department, or nominally State,
                    personnel. We had a variety of things. Anyway, I was the second State Department
                    officer, Vice Consul, as opposed to Consul. I basically did the consular work
                    and whatever economic and political reporting there was to be done, and also
                    kept an eye on the administrative functioning of the consulate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of consular work would there be there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>SERVICE: We issued both IVs (immigrant visas) and NIVs (non-immigrant visas), but
                    not a great many. I had a very good Portuguese lady for my consular assistant,
                    Cecilia Peixoto da Silveira by name. She would tell me what to do and I would
                    generally do it, and ask a few questions from time to time. It was not
                    particularly difficult and not very time consuming. I suppose there were some
                    days where we didn't even do one NIV and there may have been other days when we
                    did three, four or five. The IVs became sort of interesting at one point because
                    an immigration lawyer in New York did some research and discovered that Bahia
                    had almost no backlog in immigrant visa issuance. In those days you could not
                    change your status from non-immigrant to immigrant without first leaving the
                    U.S. So this lawyer started sending his people to Bahia. I think they were
                    mainly Dominicans who came down to Bahia. Then we would process them through. We
                    had one case I remember particularly. The immigrant visa regulations say that a
                    person has to be able to read in order to receive a visa. I got one poor young
                    women and gave her something to read in Spanish and found out she couldn't read
                    it. I said, “I'm sorry I won't be able to issue you your IV.” Eventually the
                    lawyer found a way around that by bringing her boyfriend down, and having them
                    get married. Once they were married, it didn't matter whether she could
                    read.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Consul then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: A guy named Harold Midkiff. Harold Midkiff had a missionary background
                    in Brazil that was sort of parallel to that of my father in China. He knew the
                    country well and spoke Portuguese fluently. He knew the manners and culture and
                    what not. He was a very nice person.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was AID a big deal in Bahia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: It was a big deal in Brazil, but it was not all that evident in Bahia
                    because the main bases of operation were in Rio and Recife. We would get people
                    in and sometimes they would come to the office. The only AID-related people who
                    were stationed there that I remember were a bunch of college professors, some
                    from Michigan State and some from the University of Southern California who had
                    AID contracts to teach business and public administration at the University of
                    Bahia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the social life like for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>SERVICE: I had a girlfriend who was Brazilian. We used to do a lot of things
                    together. Near where I lived there was something called the British Club where I
                    used to go when I didn't have anything else to do, and play snooker, usually
                    with a Brazilian named Jaime Cerqueira. There were a few Anglo-Brazilians who
                    hung out there. Most of them were quite far removed from anything British. One
                    time, a real Brit came in and nobody said a word to him. Finally, he shouted in
                    anger, “What kind of British club is this? Nobody says hello. Nobody asks who I
                    am.” He stormed out. There were a few Americans in Bahia. Some were in the oil
                    business. There was a Lone Star cement plant. Another American raised chickens.
                    In the summer, students would come down from U.S. universities. The ones I
                    remember best were the anthropologists from Columbia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any disquiet within our diplomatic and
                        consulaestablishment about how to deal with the Brazilian military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: If there was, we were not aware of it. I don't remember any guidance
                    messages, or warnings about what to do and not do — although there may have
                    been. The USG [United States government] view at the time was that the
                    military-led revolution was a positive development. It would be good for Brazil
                    and good for our relations. Only later did we become more skeptical and
                    critical. You'll remember that in the first year or two, at least, of the
                    military government, the official U.S. position as stated by the Ambassador and
                    perhaps somewhat less strongly by Washington, was that this was a great thing.
                    This was a country on the road to development and would return to democracy very
                    soon, too. Lincoln Gordon was very high on the military government. I suppose
                    all of us sort of reflected that. In retrospect, I think what surprised many of
                    us was how long the military were able to stay in power.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The expectation then, I assume, was that they will put
                        things iorder and then go back to the barracks?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes, I think most of us thought that. It was only gradually that it
                    became clear that they intended to stay as long as was necessary. And nobody
                    knew how long might be considered necessary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've heard other people say that if a military government
                        doesn'get out in about two years, they just aren't going to leave.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: There is something to that. If they don't relinquish power voluntarily
                    within a certain period of time, then they are eventually forced to do so. They
                    will sort of be pushed out the door. In the Brazil case, as in many others, they
                    eventually overstayed their welcome. To put it another way, they eventually ran
                    out of solutions to Brazil's many complex problems.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: That was before I was in Brazil. I had left Managua in September 1963. I
                    was in San Francisco. I learned of Kennedy's death while I was in San Francisco
                    sitting in a restaurant having a cup of coffee.</p>

                <p>SERVICE: I saw a good bit of Bahia.</p>
                <p>Q: It is a big state, isn't it?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: It's a big state. Soon after I got there, the Consul and I went off to
                    the interior and visited Peace Corps volunteers. We went west from Bahia to the
                    S�o Francisco River, and then followed it north and west to the Paulo Afonso
                    falls. There was a big power plant there. One time we had a professor of
                    anthropology from Columbia visit Bahia. He and I drove up through the interior
                    of the state. I visited a friend who was doing a Ph.D. thesis on the coast, in
                    Sergipe, which is the next state up. On weekends, with my friends, I would drive
                    up and down the coast to various places. I took a boat down the coast one time,
                    and worked my way back by various means. In some ways Bahia was the most idyllic
                    of my assignments. I was young and single. I had a fairly steady girlfriend for
                    the last year or so, Mar�a Fran�a Machado Pinto. When I left the Consulate for
                    the last time and turned to look at the door, I actually shed a few tears. I
                    have not done that on leaving any other post.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left in 1965. You were a four-year veteran of the
                        ForeigService by this time. Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: I went back to Washington, to ARA [Bureau of American and Regional
                    Affairs] Personnel. Bill Lehfeldt was head of it at that time. I worked for Bill
                    for a year, I suppose. Then Roger Brewin took over for him. I did two years in
                    all.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is 1965 - 1967?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: That's right.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>Q: How did the placement system work? With these things, the personnel system
                    keeps changing. Were the assignments essentially done within the bureaus? How
                    did you work with centralized personnel?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: You're right. It keeps changing. As I remember, when I was there, there
                    was a period in which the bureaus allegedly had more authority than they did
                    later. Even so, it wasn't a great deal. While the assignment officers were in
                    the regional bureaus, you had to go to a central panel meeting to actually have
                    the assignment approved. It was run by people in central personnel. You put the
                    case for why you couldn't live without so-and-so in one of your posts. Somebody
                    else might want the same person for another area. Or one of the career
                    management people might object that what you were offering wasn't good for the
                    officer, even if he or she wanted it. In short, there were a lot of ways in
                    which you might not win. You did not have the final say.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there a more enclosed ARA group of people? Did you find that there wasn't
                    much interchange between the EUR [Bureau of European Affairs] and the ARA
                    people?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes, I suppose so. I think we were most evident, most aware of it, when
                    we had people who wanted to go to some other part of the world, and it was hard
                    to find a place for them. The other bureaus would frequently say, “look, we
                    already know some other officer or have some responsibility to so-and-so.” ARA
                    was probably less exclusive, in part because we were not the most popular region
                    for assignments. Whenever we had knowledge of somebody with a good reputation,
                    serving in another area rather than Latin America, we would look very carefully
                    at them and some we would take, and some we would not. But, we were not
                    resistant to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you come away with any impressions about the fairness
                        of hothe personnel system was set up and how it worked?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Not very strong feelings from that period. As a relatively junior
                    officer in our office, I was dealing with the more junior placements of both
                    officers and staff. I did not have a lot of first-hand experience with the
                    distortions of the system that you probably have higher up. It was more of a
                    run-of-the-mill, routine thing. People tended to go more or less where the
                    collective wisdom thought they should go. Q: What about Vietnam? Was that
                    beginning to lay a levy on all of you?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes, but it does not loom large in my memory. It must not have been a
                    major issue within ARA. At that period it affected primarily those who were just
                    coming into the service, and of course those who had some EAP background. There
                    were a few volunteers from ARA, but I don't remember any forced assignments.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Q: What areas did you find hard to put in junior officers? Was it sort of the
                    Mexican border post? In other words, were there places that were difficult and
                    other ones that were highly sought after?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: It was surprising sometimes. I remember one second tour officer, coming
                    out of Montevideo, who was particularly talented. We offered him the chance to
                    be the principal officer in David, Panama. We felt that was a real opportunity.
                    But he turned it down and left the Foreign Service. He is now the President of
                    the Federal Reserve Bank in New York, Bill McDonough. When he turned down David,
                    I had to call an officer who was headed for Rio, but had stopped off in San Jos�
                    or somewhere, and tell him that he should go no further than Panama, that David
                    was his next assignment. I think he took it well. I don't remember the border
                    posts as being particularly difficult. In part the consular positions at those
                    posts were filled by first tour officers who did not usually complain. And there
                    were always a few officers who asked for those posts because they needed to be
                    close to the U.S. I suppose the easiest posts to staff were the bigger, more
                    sophisticated, better-known capitals. The harder ones were the poorer, tropical
                    cities. But there were always people who realized that you get more opportunity
                    and more job diversity at the smaller places.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1967, did you stay in Washington or go out again?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: In 1967, I went to Stanford for a year. To do Latin American studies. In
                    May of that year I had married Karol Kleiner, whom I had first met in Nicaragua
                    four years earlier. We drove across the country in her Austin Healey.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, that was 1967 - 1968. Was there any cast to the
                        Stanforfaculty on Latin America?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: In general, the faculty was very critical of U.S. policy. Some of them
                    were quite excited by what Castro was doing. They viewed U.S. policy as overly
                    focused on national security issues and in support of the status quo and the
                    wealthy. They thought we should grab hold of the winds of change. Some believed
                    that U.S. policy was determined by U.S. corporations. There were frequent
                    references to United Fruit.</p>

                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>SERVICE: To some extent. Sometimes they went too far in terms of what was driving
                    U.S. policy. I used to tell them “I've been there six, seven years. I've never
                    seen what you are saying is the rationale for our policy. There is no basis for
                    it in any paper I have read, any confidential message I have seen, any
                    discussion I have been involved in.” They would say, “Of course, it is not
                    enunciated, but it is there.” Apparently we were all conditioned to follow
                    certain policies without being fully aware of what we were doing. That kind of
                    analysis has never impressed me.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it more the idea that American business interests

                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes, there was some of that. That was how they viewed U.S./Latin America
                    relations in the first part of the century. And Guatemala seemed to confirm the
                    thesis. And then came Castro and Cuba. We hadn't yet gotten to the Chilean
                    experience. It was not hard to make the case for business domination of U.S.
                    policy toward the area, if one were so inclined. But there was very little
                    evidence for it in anything that I saw or heard in those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At Stanford, how was Cuba observed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: With some notable exceptions, they were not particularly attracted to
                    it. It was a very interesting experiment, but basically a bad system and
                    probably not even very appropriate for Latin America in the long run. The
                    exceptions, people like Richard Fagen, were quite excited by it and thought it
                    opened up possibilities for the rest of the area. They went down there, studied
                    it, wrote about it, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it that by this time, you felt that you were a

                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes. I like to know well whatever I am doing. I was not particularly
                    attracted to the idea of continually moving from one area to the next. I felt it
                    was worth devoting most of my career to a particular area. Latin America seemed
                    to be as interesting as any other.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: I went to Mexico City. I was a political officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Mexico City from 1968 to 1971 as a political
                        officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Political officer. Internal political reporting.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>Q: When you got there in 1968, how would you describe the political situation in
                    Mexico? Then, how would you describe the relationship between the United States
                    and Mexico at that time?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: Mexico has a very special political system, had in those days. It was a
                    one-party-dominant system. Supposedly it was leftist, revolutionary and
                    progressive, but in fact, the years of rule by one party, non-democratically,
                    had led to a great deal of disaffection for the regime, particularly among the
                    young people, as well as by the left. The PRI (Partido Revolucionario
                    Institucional) governments ruled by very strict measures of control. Everyone
                    knew all this had to change sometime, but nobody knew when. The role of the
                    internal affairs political officer was to try to identify and project the
                    incipient trends which were eventually going to change the way Mexico was
                    governed. Relations with the U.S. were quite good, although there was a lot of
                    rhetoric negative to the west. The Embassy view, and that of most observers, was
                    that Mexican governments used foreign policy issues and anti-U.S. rhetoric to
                    mollify the left within Mexico. It was a way of distracting attention from
                    internal failures and shortcomings.</p>
                <p>When I arrived in July, 1968, there was considerable ferment in student and
                    leftist circles. The Olympics were scheduled for October. The students and left
                    more generally decided that this provided an opportunity to force concessions
                    out of the government. I don't recall at this point what their demands were. I'm
                    sure there were some specific demands, but underlying them was disillusionment
                    with a revolution that had become increasingly conservative over the years, that
                    was viewed as being controlled by the wealthy, that was corrupt, and that gave
                    little more than lip service to democracy. And, of course, they assumed the
                    worst of U.S. policy. This was 1968, don't forget, and student activism was very
                    much in fashion. It had started in the U.S. in the mid-1960s and then picked up
                    with the opposition to the Vietnam War. There has been Paris earlier that year.
                    And there were the events in Prague.</p>
                <p>Beginning in July there were a number of marches staged by students and leftist
                    groups. Finally, in early October I believe, there was a major confrontation at
                    a place called Tlatelolco in the Plaza de Tres Culturas. That is where the
                    Foreign Ministry was. With the Olympics due to start shortly, the government
                    apparently decided to crush the movement. Shooting started and a good many
                    people were killed. Nobody, to this day, has an official figure, but most think
                    at least 200 died, most of whom were students. That was a major issue and event
                    in world news. And the result was what the government wanted. There were no more
                    marches or demonstrations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there when the shooting at Tlatelolco took
                        place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: I was in Mexico City, but not at the Plaza that day. I habeen there
                    about three months when it happened.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>Q: Usually, when you are the police shooting your own students, this is often
                    considered as bad as it gets. How did the Mexican Government get away with
                    this?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: They had been getting away with it for a long time. What was new, and
                    perhaps important for the future, was that this time those killed were not from
                    the lowest groupings in the society. In the past, when the Government had used
                    heavy repression, it had usually been against peasants or poorer workers. When
                    you start shooting down students, you are getting into the middle-class, to some
                    extent. I don't know where exactly the students came from, but it seemed to
                    indicate a degree of disaffection which perhaps hadn't existed before, or at
                    least not so openly. That was in 1968, after the student movements in the U.S.
                    and Europe. It was just before the Tupamaros in Uruguay and far left movements
                    in Argentina and Chile started to attract public attention. It was something
                    that was happening worldwide, and Mexico was a small piece of it.</p>
                <p>Q: It is really interesting, because even in the worst of times, in Paris, and
                    throughout Europe, 1968 was the year of the students. Basically, students
                    weren't being shot. In fact, when we accidentally shot some students at Kent
                    State, about two years later, it really was a culmination of our involvement in
                    Vietnam.</p>
                <p>SERVICE: Old ways die hard. Supposedly the government of Mexico was behind the
                    killing of 45 people, fairly recently, down in Chiapas. They went into a town
                    and killed 45 people. Same tactics, thirty years later. Of course, the what
                    happens is much more visible today. The whole world knows about it. Thirty years
                    ago nobody would have known about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did our Embassy react to this? We are talking about
                        the 196time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: This was before the human rights emphasis in our policy which really
                    came in with Carter. As I said, what happened at Tlatelolco was nothing new. The
                    scale was greater and the fact that it involved primarily students was perhaps a
                    novelty, but basically the U.S. Government continued to do business as usual. I
                    don't remember if the Embassy even put out a statement? Nowadays, we certainly
                    would. There would be something put out in Washington and probably something
                    down there. In 1968 we were still very much in the mode of “you don't meddle in
                    internal matters.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't Echeverr�a the Minister of Interior or something at
                        thipoint?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes, Luis Echeverr�a. He was Interior Minister at the timof
                    Tlatelolco.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Didn't Tlatelolco mark him as somebody to watch out for or
                        bconcerned about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>SERVICE: I think it did. In preceding decades there had been a certain tradition
                    that the Interior Minister would move up to be president. That continued to be
                    true in Echeverr�a's case and I think that his role in what happened at
                    Tlatelolco contributed to making it so. In the PRI at that time there was still
                    a bonus for forcefulness and for decisive action. Then, too, the Interior
                    Minister, because he controlled the intelligence services, knew where skeletons
                    were buried. It was a position of great power, probably still is. Didn't you see
                    in the paper, yesterday or today, the article about eavesdropping and taps and
                    whatnot, and records kept on people.</p>
                <p>One of my jobs was to speculate about who would be the next president. I think
                    the fact that Echeverr�a he had put himself on the line to stop the student
                    movement gave him a leg up to be the next President.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going back to this Olympic thing, who was the
                        President?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: When I got there it waDiaz Ordaz, who had been president since 1964. He
                    was not a very charismatic or physically attractive person. But he was not one
                    of the more corrupt presidents either.</p>
                <p>Q: You were looking at the opposition parties. This was in 1968 to 1971. Was it
                    considered an exercise in futility? I mean, looking at something that was sort
                    of kept on the sideline? How did we feel about it?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: I think it was looked at as inevitable that someday Mexico would have a
                    more democratic system, but no one knew when. In other words, it was not a waste
                    of time to get to know and analyze the main opposition party, even though nobody
                    in the Embassy or in Washington thought that they were going to take power
                    anytime in the foreseeable future.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was a difference seen between the PAN [Partido Accion
                        Nacional]and the PRI?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: The PAN was center right, the PRI center left. The PAN was not
                    anti-Catholic while the PRI, in theory at least, continued to be anti-clerical.
                    The PRI was corrupt, if only because it had been in power for so long. The PAN
                    was viewed as being reformist and relatively honest, but of course had had very
                    little temptation. I think it had won one or two city governments along the
                    border, but not much else at that time. Of course, most of these things are the
                    differences which come in part from one being in power, or not being in power.
                    You're never quite sure what is going to happen if the roles change.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have quite a ready reception to the leadership of
                        PAN?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes and no. They had an office downtown with maybe one or two people in
                    it. My main contact was a person by the name of Gonz�lez Schmal, if I remember
                    correctly. The head of the party lived in the north, somewhere along the border,
                    where the PAN had had its few electoral successes.</p>
                <p>I, personally, and maybe the Embassy, looked in a friendly manner on the PAN
                    simply because its members seemed to say many of the right thing. They hadn't
                    had a chance to prove that they were hypocritical, whereas the PRI had. The fact
                    is, it was then a fairly conservative party, not necessarily with the right
                    solutions to Mexico's problems. But it did offer the possibility of an
                    alternation of power. It was seen as a necessary piece of the puzzle which would
                    become stronger with time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved at all in defending America's role
                        iVietnam or with Cuba? Was this something that came up all the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes, sure. Not daily, but with enough frequency that we knew there were
                    always going to be those two questions if you went out in public situations.</p>
                <p>Q: I never served in Mexico, but there seems to be this great cooperation on so
                    many things with Mexico, across the border and all, sort of a Ministry to
                    Department type of thing. The one place where there was a great diversion . . .
                    it was almost as though it really doesn't make any difference, this is where we
                    will show our independence, was on foreign policy. Is this something we thought
                    that the Foreign Ministry viewed as sort of preserving the leftist image of the
                    Revolution, or something?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes, I think we had that feeling at the time. That was the sop you gave
                    to your left wing supporters, of which there were a significant number. It was
                    relatively easy because it didn't affect vital, day-to-day, interests of the
                    party or its more influential supporters. It was more symbolic than substantive,
                    since Mexico at that time did not play a large international role. We at the
                    Embassy sort of shrugged and tried to convince our Mexican interlocutors that
                    some of their positions didn't really make much sense in terms of their own
                    stated ideals and aspirations, but few were persuaded.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you ever have the feeling that you were dealing with a state that in some
                    ways was comparable to some of the states that we were opposed to, the East
                    Bloc, anything like that, as far as government control?</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>SERVICE: Sure. You had that feeling. The Government of Mexico was very arbitrary
                    with its own people quite often. It professed one thing and practiced another.
                    Even so, and although I had not been in the Eastern Bloc or any communist
                    country at that time, I assume there was still much more freedom of all types in
                    Mexico than there was there. Most important from our own policy perspective,
                    they were generally supportive on bilateral issues, although not so much with
                    respect to multilateral matters.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: There was an Embassy of course, and we watched it closely, with the help
                    of the Mexicans. I don't recall a large non-official Cuban community. Most
                    Cubans who fled Castro's Cuba wanted to get to the U.S., not stay in Mexico.
                    Many of those who were pro-Castro had gone back. Obviously, the U.S. government
                    was interested in who was going to Cuba, and coming from there, and there were
                    arrangements for facilitating that, but I was not involved.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were our Ambassadors when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: When I first got there in 1968, Fulton (Tony) Freeman wathe ambassador.
                    He soon retired.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was an old Latin American hand, wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes, and a Chinese hand of sorts. He also spent time in Europe. He was
                    somebody my family had known for a long time. He was followed by Robert McBride.
                    He was still there when I left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he fit in with the scene?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: McBride was seen as very European. He grew up in Europe and his father
                    was a businessman. He spoke very good Spanish, very good French. I associated
                    him with the European-type diplomat in our service, rather than the more relaxed
                    Latin Americanist. He was rather stiff, austere, but a kindly person if you
                    could get beneath the shell.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Fulton Freeman operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>SERVICE: Freeman was a very outgoing person. He was a musician, a golfer, a
                    champion badminton player. He liked people and liked to be sociable. He had a
                    heart attack which slowed him down a little bit. I was in Personnel at the time.
                    Another Ambassador by the name of Tello, wanted to be the Ambassador to Mexico.
                    He kept calling up to see how he was, hoping perhaps that Tony would have to
                    retire. McBride was quite the opposite. McBride was a Europeanist. He was very
                    quiet, subdued. Two totally different styles. If I had to guess, I would say
                    that Freeman came across better with the Mexicans than McBride did.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you feel in the political section, sort of through osmosis, from the
                    Ambassador down, any change with the advent of the Nixon administration as
                    dealing with our policy and Mexico?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: The main change we felt, those of us on the ground, was with respect to
                    narcotics. Narcotics suddenly became a very big issue. Soon after Nixon became
                    President, we mounted something called Operation Intercept at the border, which
                    resulted in tremendously long lines to get across the border, because our law
                    enforcement people had decided to make a serious check of all vehicles. This
                    created great distress among Mexicans and Americans on the border. We agreed to
                    sit down with the Mexicans and try to work out improved cooperation between the
                    two countries. I was the State officer at the Embassy assigned to that task. I
                    spent about six weeks with somebody from Customs, somebody from the Bureau of
                    Alcohol and Drugs (George Gaffney), as it was then called. We worked out an
                    agreement. Later, Nixon came down to Puerto Vallarta and met with Diaz Ordaz. I
                    was involved with Mitchell, Haldemann, and Ehrlichman, and sat in on their
                    meetings with their Mexican counterparts. I think that Egil (Bud) Krogh was also
                    there. The main topic was narcotics. On a lighter note, I joined John and Martha
                    Mitchell for drinks one evening at the house they were staying in. I think they
                    both had martinis. When we walked to the bus to go to the hotel for dinner, I
                    held Martha's arm.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your feeling toward the Mexican approach to narcotics then? Was this
                    before the, big money and the really corrupting influence came in, or was it
                    already a problem?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: It was already a problem, but we were not sure what could be done about
                    it. I suppose our feeling was it was that it was very difficult for Mexico to
                    control what went on within its borders because of the poverty and the
                    prevalence of corruption. There was also an attitude on the part of the
                    Mexicans, rarely openly expressed, that it was okay to profit at the expense of
                    the Americans. In retrospect, the elevation of drugs to a high place on the
                    bilateral agenda was probably important in forcing the Mexicans to come to grips
                    with the problems of their own governance, the lack of real democracy and
                    accountability, the shortcomings of the courts, etc. But at the time it probably
                    was unrealistic to expect a high degree of effectiveness against drugs. It
                    doesn't mean you don't try. But, you don't go in feeling very optimistic.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>Q: Was there a problem in the fact that at a small level, we had quite a few
                    Americans in jail for dealing or carrying narcotics? We are not talking about
                    big dealers, but we are talking about all of them. So, middle-class sons and
                    daughters of Americans were caught up in jail. Was this an inhibitor as far as
                    pushing any anti-drug program at that time?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: I don't remember that. I don't know how many Americans were in jail in
                    Mexico at that time. I don't remember it being raised in our internal
                    discussions. Our marching orders were to do whatever we could to get them, the
                    Mexicans, to take more effective action, to provide greater cooperation in the
                    battle against drugs.</p>
                <p>Q: As a political officer, what was your impression of the faculty and the
                    students at the University? These are always little worlds of their own, aren't
                    they, in Latin America?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: I didn't have much first-hand contact with them. My impression was that
                    they were standard Latin American leftists of that period. You had to get beyond
                    UNAM, the Universidad Nacional Aut�noma de Mexico, to the Colegio de Mexico to
                    find serious scholars by our definition. It was a private institution, or
                    quasi-private, geared more toward graduates. There were a few others that were
                    more business or technology oriented that also turned out good graduates. Much
                    later in my career I came across an explanation for why most Latin American
                    university students are leftist. When there are few books and other resources,
                    it is hard to amass learning piece by piece, perhaps eventually arriving at a
                    coherent opinion or hypothesis. But you don't need much infrastructure to
                    imagine how the world works or what are the real reasons behind events. There is
                    a great temptation to start with the theory and make reality conform.</p>
                <p>Q: In so many countries, universities seem to get taken over by Marxists who get
                    the enthusiastic support of their students until the students graduate. They
                    immediately turn around and become good, solid capitalists, or the equivalent
                    thereof. Did we devote much time and effort to the universities when you were
                    there?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: Mexico City is such a big place. UNAM such a huge place. I'm not sure we
                    devoted very much resources to it. I'm sure that USIS [United States Information
                    Service] had some programs to try to get our view of the world in there, but
                    they were probably a drop in the bucket compared to the size and the structure.
                    Unlike some of the smaller places I have served, where access was easier, I
                    don't remember much effort to get close to the universities in Mexico. Maybe we
                    figured they were too tough a nut to crack. Or, as you suggest, that most would
                    eventually become more conservative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a write-off?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>SERVICE: It was a write-off in the sense that this is a phase many Latin American
                    students go through and eventually most become less critical of the U.S., and
                    more critical of their own institutions and leaders.</p>
                <p>Q: Were we seeing a division between Mexico City and its neutrality and the
                    northern provinces? Was Mexico a divided country in how it viewed the U.S.?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes, there was some of that. The north being more influenced by the
                    U.S., and the U.S. example of democracy and how the government doesn't always
                    have to be corrupt. Businesses also have responsibilities, not simply to get
                    contracts, but to do something for the country. We found more of that in the
                    northern tier than elsewhere. There was also a division between Mexico City and
                    the rest of the country. The head and the body kind of thing — the outside being
                    much poorer than the center, and therefore having different interests and
                    outlook.</p>
                <p>Q: Were we looking at all, or just as political reporters, the southern part of
                    Mexico? I think Chiapas now is a major thing. Was that area almost closed off?
                    Well, not closed off, but not a place we paid much attention to?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: Chiapas didn't come up as I remember, but Yucatan did. There was a lot
                    of labor unrest during the late 1960s in Yucatan. I remember writing reports on
                    the background of that unrest and what caused it. This was an area where there
                    were a lot of henequen plantations. We had a consulate in M�rida. We weren't
                    really in a position to do much more than observe and report. We had stopped our
                    AID program in Mexico before I got there. We had what is called a residual
                    program. There was somebody there tying up the loose ends.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you feel that the Embassy was a loose coalition of powers? I mean, you
                    would be doing your reporting and all, and you would have the FBI [Federal
                    Bureau of Investigation], and the Water Commission, Social Security, all sort of
                    doing their thing. It was more a conglomerate rather than a unity.</p>
                <p>SERVICE: To a certain extent, although, I don't remember that as the dominant
                    feeling. By-and-large we got along pretty well. We communicated internally
                    pretty well. We socialized together. There were no serious institutional
                    antagonisms that I can recall, none that I was involved in. The law enforcement
                    agencies sometimes fight among themselves as much as they do against the common
                    enemy. Customs and what later became DEA [Drug Enforcement Agency] have long
                    been notorious for that. So, too, the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] and FBI.
                    I don't know if it is time overtaking memories, but most of my recollections of
                    internal strife come from later in my career, not from Mexico. Our relations
                    with Mexico were so extensive even then that there may have been enough turf for
                    everybody to have his piece.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you go about your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>SERVICE: Probably in a too-bookish a manner. I read a lot. I would read
                    newspapers and magazines, and things like that. I read a lot of the U.S.
                    academic publications on Mexico. I even got in the habit of, at one point,
                    putting footnotes in the reports, which I'm sure wasn't appreciated by
                    Washington. It was still the days where most of our reporting was by dispatch.
                    By then we called them airgrams. Unlike telegrams, they didn't have the same
                    sense of urgency. They could be rather lengthy, although I don't think mine ever
                    got into the 30 or 40 page category. I would take a problem, such as the
                    guerrilla movements in Chihuahua and Guerrero, and read everything I could find
                    on it, and do an all-you-ever-wanted-to-know piece about those places and their
                    problems.</p>
                <p>Of course, you had to do a certain amount of spot reporting too. You had to keep
                    up with what was in the press that day. I would get those out of the way by
                    10:00 or 11:00 a.m., whatever was in the paper, or something that was heard
                    overnight. Then, I would spend the rest of the day working on these larger
                    pieces. The one I enjoyed particularly and I may have mentioned it before, had
                    its origins in a suggestion by one of my contacts that I read a book on the
                    style of Mexicans, Mexican politicians. It was a fascinating book. I wrote a
                    paper on the mentality of apparatchik iMexico. I would like to read that paper
                    again. In those days, I never kept copies of what I wrote, and it may still be
                    too early for it to be declassified.</p>
                <p>History has always interested me, and I would show off that knowledge from time
                    to time. One morning I went into the Ambassador's staff meeting — this must have
                    been 1970 or 1971 — and announced “This is the 50th anniversary of having no
                    successful coups in Mexico.” I think the last one was in 1921 or so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Mexican politicians? Were they the same
                        breeof cat as American politicians, when you got to know them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: I can't say that I really got to know any important ones very well. I
                    knew some of the younger, would-be politicians. They did not seem all that
                    different from me, from other Americans my age. Of course I am not a politician.
                    I would say, in general, Mexican politicians are less open than their American
                    counterparts. At least they were in that age. So much depended on position and
                    contacts within the party, much less on personal popularity and ability to go
                    out and convince people. Everyone was looking over his shoulder, to some
                    extent.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, it was closer to the Communist system in that. It is not just Communist,
                    but there are other systems where the voting list and the candidate list are
                    controlled. That's how you move ahead.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>SERVICE: Or move back. And of course there is a lot of corruption. This was one
                    of the main ways to make enough money for a reasonable lifestyle if you were a
                    moderate-to-poor Mexican.</p>
                <p>Q: I remember each time a President would retire, it was sort of horrifying to
                    hear of these self-made millionaires all of a sudden going off to a hacienda.
                    Did the corruption...</p>
                <p>SERVICE: That was business as usual. We have had a good bit of it ithis country
                    until fairly recently.</p>
                <p>Q: You were there when the changeover between Johnson and Nixon occurred. Johnson
                    was a Texan, and really had a very close feeling toward the Mexicans. I think
                    more than most Presidents. We had the Vietnam War. What was your impression of
                    how Johnson was perceived?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: I got there at the very tail end of the Johnson presidency. I don't
                    remember him being perceived in any particular way by the Mexicans. Of course he
                    had been badly hurt by the Vietnam War and decided not to run in 1968. I don't
                    think the Mexicans spent much time reminiscing or talking about their great
                    friend, Lyndon Johnson. I think they were just waiting to see who the next
                    president would be.</p>
                <p>Q: What was the feeling toward Nixon? Nixon was coming out of the almost-radical
                    right, of the Republican party, but he was from California, which was always
                    connected to Mexico. Did you get any feel for it, or did anybody care?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: I think the more sophisticated Mexicans knew enough to know that labels
                    don't necessarily mean very much, particularly because our interests are so
                    intertwined. I recall that Nixon had had his honeymoon in Mexico many years
                    before. There was a good publicity blurb on that aspect. I think it was
                    basically: “We got along with Eisenhower, we got along with other Republicans,
                    we can probably get along with this one.” I think there was a little bit of “I
                    told you so,” when we got to what was called Operation Intercept, about six
                    months into the Nixon period. As I already mentioned, it pretty much closed down
                    the border. It created all sorts of a brouhaha and unhappiness until a new level
                    of cooperation was worked out. I was at Puerto Vallarta when Nixon came down.
                    This must have been in 1970. The presidential meeting was uneventful. There were
                    no particular frictions or unhappiness. Everybody smiled in the right places.
                    There weren't any crowds of demonstrators. Of course Puerto Vallarta is not the
                    easiest place to get to. It may have been attractive as a meeting place for that
                    reason. There is only one road in and the same road back out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Apart from drugs, were there any other issues that we were
                        concerned about during this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>SERVICE: Mexico's good relations with Cuba were sort of a continuing mild
                    irritant, but I think we probably also felt an advantage in it, too, because
                    through the Mexicans, we were able to obtain information on Cuba that might not
                    have been that easily available otherwise. There was some risk to the Mexican
                    government, because all the Mexican security forces didn't necessarily agree
                    with the public stance toward Cuba, so you got some feedback out of that. Of the
                    border issues, I think the land question was largely resolved a little bit
                    before I got there. There was an agreement over the Chamezal, which gave back a
                    piece of land to the Mexicans. The Rio Grande had shifted its course many years
                    before, putting a small piece of land that had been theirs on our side of the
                    river. Water was a continuing problem because of scarcity. How much water each
                    country gets, and its quality.</p>
                <p>Q: As a Political Officer what you were dealing with was, in a way, remote from
                    the daily substance of our relations. There was so much back and forth across
                    the border. Towns on both sides had all sorts of relations, and all that. Here
                    we are trying to play the great game of diplomacy. The real action was almost
                    happening despite it.</p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes. Political sections are normally divided into the external affair's
                    side and the internal affairs side. I was the internal. The external did what
                    embassies do in most places. You go into the Foreign Ministry with your notes,
                    and try to get them to support our position on this or that. I was on the
                    internal side, and it was almost as academic as it was diplomatic. I was sort of
                    sitting there, looking at a system which had a lot of impressive accomplishments
                    to its name but was running out of steam. The questions were: How would it
                    evolve? How quickly? And What did this mean for our interests and relations? I
                    knew that not very much was going to happen during my time, so I could be sort
                    of above it all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you kept an eye on the PRI. That is basically where
                        everything was coming from anyway.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Nothing was going to go very far without the PRI signing oand then
                    controlling it.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you, by any chance, around when Kissinger had his famous meeting down in
                    Mexico City where he discovered . . . it was a hemispheric meeting of our chiefs
                    of mission and he came out of there saying that none of the people even know
                    what NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organization] is. He was mad as hell.</p>
                <p>SERVICE: No, that was later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It must have been later because that's when he was
                        Secretary oState.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>SERVICE: Kissinger said, “Let's get the Latin Americanists out of Latin America,
                    and let's get officers from other areas in.” There was brief flurry and then
                    personnel practices gradually returned to what they had been previously. The
                    person who was the Deputy Chief of Mission, while I was there, the second one,
                    was Jack Kubisch. He profited from Kissinger's unhappiness and from what he did
                    about it. Kubisch went off to be DCM in Paris and then, at a later date, our
                    ambassador in Greece.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like all these changes, they sound great and die within a
                        year otwo. In 1971, you went where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: In 1971, I came back to Washington for six years. But, I should note
                    before we leave Mexico that both of our children were born there, Jennifer in
                    1969 and John in 1971. Both were born in the ABC Hospital, without
                    complications.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, from 1971 to 1977, you were in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: I came back to Washington to the Office of the Inspector General. The
                    State Department had just gone through one of its self-examination processes. I
                    forget the name of it. Maybe you remember. It was something entirely internal.
                    It had not been mandated by the Vice President's office like the recent
                    Reinventing Government initiative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was one called Diplomacy. I think it was
                        Macomber.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes. Anyway, one of the recommendations was that the Office of the
                    Inspector General should be revamped and that it would start looking not simply
                    at how things were done, whether they were done correctly or incorrectly,
                    legally or not, but also at what was being done, including policy. Thomas
                    McIlhenny was named to be the Inspector General, and he asked me and various
                    others, some of us middle-grade, to be in that office as they tried to come up
                    with this new format. I served two years in the Office of the Inspector General.
                    I mainly worked in the Department, but also did one overseas inspection to
                    Guatemala.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you find the idea of working on policy? This is a very touchy issue.
                    Here are people coming from a different part of the Department, and essentially,
                    treading on the prerogatives of the Embassy, and also those of the bureaus.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>SERVICE: I didn't feel terribly comfortable doing it. We were grandstanding a
                    little bit. It is easy to criticize and say “Well, now yes, but have you thought
                    of this over here,” or “You've been doing that for 10 years and what do you have
                    to show for it?” You couldn't really be sure that any other policy would have
                    produced any better results. We tried it for a while in a rather limited way,
                    but gradually inspections returned to focusing on administrative and consular
                    matters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the clout of the inspections
                        at that time, because these had waxed and waned? At some point, inspections
                        were really very important to the people involved. Later, they didn't really
                        focus on people as much, so they really weren't paid much attention to.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: When I was there, we were in the process of disengaging from the people
                    rating part of it. I have forgotten whether we still did reports on everybody or
                    simply on certain categories of people: those who were in difficulties, or were
                    ineligible for promotion, or who asked us to. Of course, one of the problems
                    then, and even more so later, was that nothing was confidential anymore. In
                    earlier times the Inspector General didn't necessarily show the reports to the
                    people being inspected. When we came in, there was even a part of the annual
                    efficiency report that was confidential. You weren't shown it at the time, but
                    you could read it when you went back to Washington later. Do you remember
                    that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: All of that was on its way out, or already out, and it made the
                    inspectors' function less significant. When I was in the Inspection Corps, there
                    was still a good relationship between the Inspection Corps and the rest of the
                    Department. There was not the same degree of combativeness that seems to
                    characterize the process today. It was still almost totally a Foreign Service
                    operation. The Inspector General and one of his two deputies were Foreign
                    Service. One deputy was brought in from outside. He was supposed to provide some
                    outside management expertise and what not. Coming out of the Macomber reforms,
                    there was a general willingness to give the new system a try, to cooperate and
                    have good relations. We had close ties to the Policy Planning staff and various
                    other entities. It was a pleasant environment. What we accomplished is hard to
                    say, but we had some useful recommendations.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>SERVICE: A place where it was hard to be optimistic, even harder than in a place
                    like Mexico. In Mexico, you had the feeling that someday this country is going
                    to make it. With respect to Guatemala and some of the other Central American
                    countries, you could not be so certain. They are smaller and more stratified. In
                    Guatemala, you had a large Indian population that was largely excluded from the
                    more modern and westernized part of society. It was hard to see a clear path
                    toward development or democracy. You had to wonder whether what we were doing
                    was worth it. All of the money we put in as aid and all the support we have
                    given them, wasn't it basically just helping the rich to hold onto their
                    privileges? Maybe yes, maybe no. On the other hand, our top priority was
                    national security. We didn't want in Guatemala or in Central America what later
                    happened with the Sandinistas in Nicaragua and almost in El Salvador.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: I went to the E Bureau [Bureau of Economic Affairs], I think it was then
                    called, soon to become the EB Bureau [Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs].
                    I went to something called the Office of Food Policy and Programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from 1973 to 1976?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes.</p>
                <p>Q: What was this office? I mean, what were they dealing with?</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>SERVICE: The office I was in was calleFood Policy and Programs. I headed the Food
                    Programs Division. It dealt with the PL [Public Law] 480 program — Food for
                    Peace, although for some reason we in State called it Food for Freedom. Our
                    basic job was to be State's voice in the interagency decisions on where food aid
                    was going to go, how much to whom. Most of the program action was with AID and
                    the Agriculture Department. But State was represented because of the political
                    and national security dimensions. It was an interesting time because, as you may
                    recall, there was a serious world food shortage, starting in about 1972, which
                    culminated in the World Food Conference in Rome in 1974. World stocks were very
                    low. Therefore prices were high. Some of the poor countries could not buy food
                    and depended on food aid. The issue within the U.S. Government was, should
                    allocation of food aid be determined primarily by humanitarian criteria or by
                    political criteria? This being the Kissinger period, the political criteria
                    tended to win out. Kissinger was not very much swayed by humanitarian criteria,
                    as far as food aid went. The opposition to that position was in AID and to some
                    extent in Agriculture, and certainly among some people on the Hill. Usually we
                    would try to accommodate both humanitarian and political concerns. But, in the
                    few times that we really had to choose, we tended to go more toward the
                    political criteria. I think this later was one of the factors which lead to the
                    Bureau of Humanitarian Affairs, or Human Rights, whatever you want to call it.
                    There was a feeling that humanitarian concerns should be a more explicit
                    component of our foreign policy. Therefore, a bureau was created.</p>
                <p>Q: How was this difference between policy and needs resolved? Was it that we
                    wanted to sell wheat or give wheat to India? Part of the problem was, wasn't it
                    at this time, that India was really able to take care of itself? This was one of
                    the big driving forces.</p>
                <p>SERVICE: It was still not self-sufficient entirely. I remember sitting in on a
                    meeting with Kissinger and the Indian Ambassador. I was the note taker. I think
                    I actually spoke once. We had been warned that note takers were there to be seen
                    but not heard. It came to some point in the conversation, where neither of them
                    knew the answer, so I spoke up and told them what the answer was. But, how were
                    the allocation issues resolved? Tom Enders was the Assistant Secretary oEB. He
                    and I worked up the allocations that we thought Kissinger would support. I went
                    over to the NSC and cleared them with Bob Hormats or Richard Kennedy. Then we
                    brought them back as a done deal. We showed them to AID and said, “Hey,
                    Kissinger decided this is the way it is going to be.” Much of this was at the
                    margin. It was a question of two or three, rather small countries, which AID
                    thought were deserving. These were countries that should have received something
                    for humanitarian reasons, but that were either were left out entirely or got
                    less than AID would have liked.</p>
                <p>Q: You had the Rome conference on it... World Food, in this 1970s period, you
                    were dealing with this. Is that right? What was our initial attitude toward the
                    calling of this conference, and all? We were the major food suppliers.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>SERVICE: That was handled by the Food Policy side of the office. I think we went
                    along with it fairly early on. We got cranked up and played a major role.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there the feeling that...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Ed Martin was our representative.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there the feeling that there wasn't a real answer to the food crisis or
                    was there the feeling that if everybody pulls their socks up and uses the right
                    kind of fertilizer, we might be able to take care of it? It is essentially the
                    case today.</p>
                <p>SERVICE: I don't remember great pessimism or fatalism. There had been a couple of
                    bad years. But they were abnormal. The expectation was that if we could just get
                    over this year, and next year, the immediate problem would go away. I forget
                    when the Green Revolution really got going. It may have been a few years later.
                    But we were already aware of the possibilities for expanded production in the
                    developing world. We did not see it as a crisis which was only going to get
                    worse.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In other words, it was a cyclical weather thing, more than
                        thaall of a sudden we were outgrowing our means of production?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Except, obviously there was concern about population growtand the long
                    term impact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you feeling the hot breath of the American wheat
                        farmers,and all, or was that coming from somewhere else?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: The farmers, of course, always saw food aid as a way of helping to get
                    rid of some of the surplus. In the period we are talking about, there were no
                    surpluses. That meant that there was less food made available and it cost more
                    to buy. I don't remember the farmers being one way or the other on the issue.
                    They got paid regardless, whether the government bought their wheat to give
                    away, or whether it sold on the open market. They saw food aid as a mechanism
                    that was there and worth preserving.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any other crises? You had food and what
                        else?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>SERVICE: I had food, basically. There were an amusing moment, given my own
                    background. Twice a year, or maybe it was three times a year, I went over to
                    meetings with the Food Aid Committee in London, which met in conjunction with
                    the International Wheat Council. The first time I went was in February of 1974,
                    and one of the issues on the agenda of the International Wheat Council was the
                    admission of Communist China. By then the PRC [People's Republic of China] was
                    already in the UN [United Nations]. Logically, this paved the way for admission
                    to all UN-affiliated organizations. My instructions were to oppose it, but at
                    the same time to know I was going to lose, and not be too obnoxious. In other
                    words, put up a show of opposition, but lose gracefully. I got up various times
                    and argued against the PRC's admission. Eventually, of course, I was argued
                    down. I figured I had done my job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why were we taking that stand? Was it just domestic
                        Americapolitics?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: I guess so. We, of course, had still not established relations with
                    Beijing. While we were not exactly still marching down the track we had been on
                    before, we were adjusting only slowly to the new reality. Nobody in Washington
                    was going to fall on his or her sword to keep China out of the Wheat Council. We
                    just wanted to be positioned correctly when we lost.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1976, you were out of this, I take it, and off
                        somewhere else?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: I had first hoped to be a DCM. I think I had a reasonable chance to be
                    DCM in Guyana. But, I was then selected for the National War College [NWC].
                    Guyana didn't seem that attractive a place. The National War College by most
                    accounts was a useful and pleasant experience. I opted to go there for a
                    year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, 1976 to 1977?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the War College?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>SERVICE: It was a delightful year. It was not a laborious year. I think it has
                    become more rigorous, more exacting since then. You can now get a degree out of
                    your time there, and you have to write some sort of thesis, and what not. In
                    those days, it was still pretty relaxed. You would go to lectures in the
                    morning, and then you would have a certain number of classes in the afternoon.
                    It was usually over by 3:30. You had two hours for lunch. Some afternoons you
                    may not have anything. I used it to get back in shape, in part. I ran around the
                    campus out there and actually organized and won the three-mile competition
                    between NWC and the Industrial College of the Armed Forces. I even made the
                    trophy that was then presented to the winning NWC team. It was very pleasant.
                    Some of the course material was useful and some of the speakers were very good.
                    Perhaps most useful was getting to know the U.S. military better than is
                    possible in the normal course of a career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the attitude of our military
                        officertoward the Vietnam experience. This was not long after the
                        collapse.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: I think there was a lot of resentment still about how we had fought the
                    war iVietnam, particularly on the part of the Army officers. The resentment was
                    about not going into a war unless you were prepared to win. Quite clearly, with
                    hindsight and from their perspective, we had not been in the Vietnam War to win.
                    I don't remember as much of that from the Air Force. The Navy made the least
                    impression on me. I don't know if you know much about the War College, but there
                    has been a tradition of the Air Force and the Army sending their best people
                    there, while the Navy tends to send its best people to its own college. There
                    was a course on Vietnam and I took it. It was given by a civilian. I don't
                    remember tremendous angst or unhappiness, but the emotions did show through
                    occasionally.</p>

                <p>SERVICE: When I got there, there was no Ambassador. David Popper had left a few
                    months before. Tom Boyatt was the Charg�. I suspect he has a long history here
                    somewhere.</p>

                <p>SERVICE: Anyway, he was the Charg� for the first six months I was there. Then
                    George Landau came as Ambassador. He was there the rest of the time I was in
                    Chile.</p>
                <p>Q: Chile had been the focus of much of our attention, probably as much as Cuba
                    was during the 1960s. How did you view the situation in Chile, when you arrived
                    in 1977?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: Well, a number of things strike me. One is a sort of siege mentality.
                    This was well after the worst of the repression. There was very little overt
                    repression going on when we got there, and I think probably very few political
                    prisoners still. Many of them had gone into exile. On the other hand, there was
                    a continuing polarization of feelings about the Allende period, and particularly
                    on the right, which we tended to see more of. The left was either out of the
                    country or very quiet. The attitude by the more conservative sectors was if you
                    weren't here during the Allende period, then you can't understand. If you raised
                    any sort of query or question mark about why this or that took place or had to
                    happen, or was necessary, they would almost always end up saying that you can't
                    understand if you weren't here. There may be a grain of truth in that, but it
                    was made to carry too much weight.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we view Pinochet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: We viewed him basically, in negative terms, although we thought that
                    some of the changes he was trying to bring about were potentially positive for
                    the country. He had the sense to listen to some of the U.S.- trained economists.
                    He was trying to implement their ideas. Certain sectors of our government
                    thought that was very positive.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there during, essentially, the Carter years,
                        weren't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes. I got there in the summer of 1977. Carter had been in office six
                    months. The big issue in bilateral relations while I was there was the
                    assassination of Orlando Letelier which took place in Washington in 1976.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Sheridan Circle.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes, in Sheridan Circle. Letelier and a woman, an American woman, an
                    assistant named Ronni Moffit were killed. Fairly early on the investigation
                    started leading back to the Chilean government. The Chilean government said,
                    “Oh, it must be Cubans, or whoever.” We spent most of the time I was there
                    trying to get those who were believed to be responsible extradited into our
                    custody. The only we got at that time was an American named Michael Townley who
                    had been the one who actually made and placed the bomb. We were able to get the
                    Pinochet government to turn him over to us. We got him back here. He provided a
                    lot of the information through plea bargaining that allowed us to solidify our
                    case against some of the others. Manuel Contreras, who was head of something
                    called DINA, the intelligence agency, is now serving time in jail, as is one of
                    the three others involved. I think a third one did also. He is now living in the
                    U.S. All of them, to some extent, were eventually punished.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this play out for you in your political dealings
                        with thPinochet government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: It was almost never mentioned in our dealings on other matters. In fact,
                    we did not have that much contact with the Pinochet government, other than the
                    Foreign Ministry. Landau once said to me, “This is a very unusual situation.
                    I've had no contact with Pinochet and I don't really think I should.” I didn't
                    disagree with him. But, it was not the situation that occurs in most places and
                    times in Latin America, where the U.S. Ambassador has frequent presidential
                    meetings. Our dealings were primarily with the Foreign Ministry, which
                    understood that we were under instructions to do x, y or z. We did it. There
                    were not a lot of animosities that I could detect. They may not have liked us.
                    Some probably saw us as sympathetic to the left. Others may have secretly
                    sympathized with our position on the Letelier matter. But it didn't really
                    affect how we did our jobs.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you have any problems with junior officers in the Political Section? I can
                    see, especially with the temper of the times, human rights, junior officers
                    wanting to change the world and all. Chile was the focus of an awful lot of
                    attention.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>SERVICE: It is interesting that you should mention that. As I recall, before I
                    got there in 1977, there had been at least one occasion when there were two
                    versions of the annual policy plan that posts had to prepare, the Country
                    Program Plan or whatever it was then called. As I recall, either the year
                    before, or the year before that, there had been a sharp division of opinion in
                    the report, with dissent messages going into Washington. That was not true while
                    I was there. I don't know if it was because personnel had changed or because the
                    situation had improved somewhat, but as I said, the worst of the repression was
                    over before I got there. There were very few, if any, reported disappearances,
                    as they called them, people being picked up and not being seen again. Let me
                    mention another interesting point. You mentioned that there was an attitude
                    toward Pinochet. At some point, I've forgotten whether it was 1977 or 1978,
                    there was the signing of the Panama Canal Treaty. The Carter people wanted to
                    make it a hemispheric thing and invite all heads of government up to Washington.
                    There was a real issue of whether Pinochet should be invited or not. They
                    decided that if it was hemispheric, and he would be invited, too. So Pinochet
                    went to Washington. I think there were probably a few demonstrators around the
                    OAS, or wherever it was done, but no more than that.</p>
                <p>Q: Landau had come from Paraguay. He was our expert on dealing with difficult
                    people. I think he had been the desk officer for the Iberian Peninsula when
                    Franco and Salazar had still been in power.</p>
                <p>SERVICE: He had a good reputation in the Human Rights Bureau.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you feeling any, if not heat, any problems with Congress and the human
                    rights activists over Chile? There was the book and then a movie called Missing.
                    I don't know if that came out at the time you were there.</p>
                <p>SERVICE: I think it did. We had some problems, which were more about accuracy
                    than anything else. Each year, we did a Human Rights report on Chile and then we
                    pressed for a rapporteur in the Human Rights Commission. It seemed to me and to
                    others of us at the Embassy that sometimes the U.S. positions on Chile as
                    drafted by our U.N. people or in Washington went beyond strict accuracy. They
                    were exaggerated and overly zealous, undoubtedly encouraged by the human rights
                    lobby. They were to some degree political statements rather than careful
                    analyses. There were some disagreements. We would go back and forth saying,
                    “Hey, look, it would be more accurate to say x.” But basically they said what
                    they wanted to say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you get your information about human rights
                        violations?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>SERVICE: We kept in touch with the opposition, a variety of opposition groups.
                    The political parties, of course, but also youth and labor. And the Catholic
                    Church had something called the Vicar�a de la Solidaridad which did a great deal
                    to compile information on abuses and help those affected. By and large they were
                    all eager to talk because we were a sounding board to the outside world. We
                    would filter out the less reliable of those contacts. We spent a lot of time
                    with the ones we trusted. It was personally rewarding because these were people
                    who were in pretty tough straights. We felt in some small way that we were
                    helping them.</p>
                <p>Q: What about the influence of the socialist countries in Europe, Sweden,
                    possibly France, at that time, Germany? Chile was a European cause at that time.
                    I was wondering whether it made much difference.</p>
                <p>SERVICE: We were quite good friends with the Swedish charge, who was Peter
                    Hammarskjold, some relation to Dag. They were a little fed up by that point with
                    the number of Chileans who had come to Sweden, claiming political harassment,
                    but who were really there on economic grounds. There were a huge number from
                    some small town up the coast, which had been depressed for years. Sweden looked
                    like a great opportunity to improve their lives. Of course, all the Eastern
                    Europeans had left, voluntarily or otherwise. I don't remember any of the
                    Europeans being particularly active on the human rights front while I was there.
                    Some of them had been earlier. The Italian charg�, poor guy, was kept there for
                    years and years because the Italians didn't want to send an Ambassador. If they
                    had removed the charg� they would have had to replace him with an ambassador,
                    because they had accepted a Chilean ambassador in Rome. Their solution was to
                    just keep the charge there, who had been there since the coup in 1973. He was
                    there for seven or eight years. He had been active early on. The Brits and the
                    French, we never saw much of them, although there is something called the
                    International Commission on European Migration (ICEM). It had been set up after
                    World War II to assist displaced Europeans go to other parts of the world. In
                    Chile, during the time I was there, it worked in the opposite direction, helping
                    persons in political danger go abroad to live. The head of the office in
                    Santiago was an Argentine. Some of theEuropean countries worked closely with
                    that.</p>
                <p>Q: Were we under constraints on things like ship visitors, or official visitors,
                    cultural exchanges, this sort of thing? Or were we having more or less normal
                    relations?</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>SERVICE: It was a little less than normal, but perhaps not very much. We had
                    UNITAS each year. Naval ships go around the continent and they have exercises
                    with their counterpart navies. We were not selling any equipment to the Chilean
                    Armed Forces. This became rather sensitive when the seat ejection cartridges for
                    their F-5s started wearing out. They felt that this was putting their pilots'
                    lives in danger. We may have voted against some loans to the Chileans, either in
                    the Inter-American Development Bank or the World Bank, but I don't think we were
                    ever able to block one. I'm not sure we did that consistently through the
                    period. There was pressure to do it, but it was not established policy. As far
                    as visitors, there were a few congressional visits. The Assistant Secretary of
                    State for Inter-American Affairs, Terry Todman, came through. I don't remember
                    anybody other than that while I was there. It was something less than normal but
                    not very much.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you have any contact with the group that was the known as the Chicago
                    Boys? They had essentially been Chilean economists who came out of the
                    University of Chicago, and other places. SERVICE: I knew some of them socially.
                    I did not have any working contact with them because that was largely handled by
                    the economic side of the house, and by the Ambassador to some extent. They were
                    a presence and very important. Not all had studied at Chicago, but they had that
                    name.</p>
                <p>Q: How about George Landau as Ambassador? Did he have to walk a fine line between
                    dealing with the Chilean government and then with the opposition, and make it
                    known how we felt in nuanced ways?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: Did you do an oral history on George?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Somebody did. I didn't do one.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: George is a fascinating guy. He is one of the best I have ever seen at .
                    . . Let me put it this way. Some people walk a middle path and end up having
                    both sides mad at them. George was able to walk the path and have both sides
                    think, “Hey, he is with me.” He is very skilled at it. Chile was a place where
                    you had to do that, to a significant extent. Pinochet loyalists thought that
                    basically it was good that the military had come in and put down all that
                    Allende stood for. We, as a government, were opposed to much of what happened.
                    Yet George had good relations with most of the pro-Pinochet people, as well as
                    with the opposition.</p>
                <p>Q: You were not there as everybody kept pointing out to you during the Allende
                    period, but did you get the feeling that what Allende was up to almost
                    inevitably took the country down the road to disaster?</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>SERVICE: My feeling was that Allende lost control. He was being pushed, pulled,
                    by groups and individuals much more radical than he was. That, as much as the
                    specific policies that he was advocating, put the country into a tailspin and
                    brought his downfall. When food becomes scarce, when you have to wait in huge
                    lines, when other things change that you've been used to, people start being
                    willing to march and pressure the military to do something. I think he lost it.
                    How do you ride a revolution? He couldn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in 1980?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the way, did Pat Derian, of the Human Rights Bureau
                        come dowto visit you at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: No, I don't think so. We may have had somebody from her office, but I
                    can't even be sure of that. I think maybe when Todman came at one point, we may
                    have had...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Terrence Todman.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: He was the Assistant Secretary for ARA at that point. He eventually got
                    booted out, essentially because he was not strong enough on human rights for the
                    Human Rights Bureau. He started saying, “Wait a second, let's be a little more
                    cautious with some of these things we're pressing.” So he was sent off to
                    Spain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1980, you went somewhere, where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Let me say another thing about Chile. We almost had a war between Chile
                    and Argentina over the Beagle Channel. I don't know if you remember that or
                    not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember it because the Beagle Channel is where Darwin's
                        boawent through on the Cape, Cape Horn.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes, it is south of the Strait of Magellan. It's a little tiny strait
                    there. There are three islands, Lennox, Picton and Nueva, that had been in
                    dispute between Chile and Argentina for a long time. The Argentines were looking
                    for ways to distract their population from some of their own problems, of which
                    we were to see more later. Things became quite volatile over these three islands
                    and where the water should be divided, etc. I think the Chileans had an arbitral
                    decision favorable to them, but the Argentines chose not to accept it. Things
                    were rather tense for two, three, four months. There were rumors of war breaking
                    out imminently. Finally the Pope got involved and called for a cooling off
                    period. They worked their way out of it. But, I spent a great deal of time
                    trying to keep up with that, reporting on it and what not, all from the safety
                    of my desk on the 10th floor of the Embassy in Santiago.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, it would strike me that looking at the geography, it would be a little
                    hard for Chile and Argentina to go to war, wouldn't it? I mean, the geography
                    being what it is.</p>
                <p>SERVICE: Sure. You've got that mountain chain which is pretty easy to block, to
                    prevent one or the other country from just pouring over. But there were a lot of
                    Chileans in Southern Argentina and the Argentines claimed to be concerned about
                    fifth column activity there. There is still one unresolved territorial dispute
                    in the Andes. We are talking about a few square miles on top of a glacier, in
                    the middle of the Andes. Whether it is worth occupying or not, I don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, where did you go then in 1980?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: In 1980, I went back to the Department to head up the . . . I was
                    supposed to head up the Office of Panama Affairs, but when I got back, somebody
                    realized that it would be more sensible to have me head up the Office of
                    Southern Cone Affairs, having just come from Chile. The office in those days
                    covered Chile, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. Those four countries. I did that

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, that was 1980 - 1982?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a rather interesting time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes, for a variety of reasons. One is because Reagan won the election,
                    and you recall that Jean Kirkpatrick was one of his principal foreign policy
                    advisors. She went out and made a splash, let's say, with an article about
                    authoritarian versus totalitarian systems. While authoritarianism isn't good per
                    se, at least it contains within the seeds of evolution to something better,
                    whereas totalitarianism precludes that kind of evolution. But that of course has
                    turned out not to be true, with the Soviet Union as the prime example. Anyway,
                    the view of many in the Reagan administration was that Carter had been too tough
                    on the Latin Americans, particularly those countries run by the military. The
                    theory was that we should stop meddling and telling them what they ought to do
                    with respect to their own internal situations and human rights. They were good
                    anti-communists and wanted to be our friends. We should make the make the most
                    of it. We got, very soon after Reagan came in, a visit to Washington by
                    Galtiere, who was the general in charge of the Argentine government at that
                    time. There had been a series of them. By then the Argentines were cooperating
                    with us in Central America. From the Reagan administration's perspective it
                    seemed like a bright new day for our relations with Argentina. Not so much with
                    Chile. Chile was always a little bit beyond the pale. That was the way Reagan
                    administration started off. It changed over time, driven in part by what was
                    happening in Central America. I give Tom Enders credit. There was a realization
                    that if you are going to make a big issue about communism in this hemisphere,
                    about Cuba and the threat to Central America, and to stress the importance and
                    desirability of democracy, not only in this hemisphere but everywhere, you have
                    to be consistent. You have to apply it to other countries in the hemisphere
                    where you have the military or the right in power. I think that became the
                    predominant message of Reagan foreign policy toward the hemisphere over time,
                    not immediately, but within two to three years.</p>
                <p>Q: What were you getting, particularly from Argentina? This was a pretty nasty
                    and inept junta that was running things. They weren't doing very well, and yet
                    they were killing off a bunch of their people. Were the disappearances still
                    going on while you were there?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: Again, I've been lucky not to be involved in the most bloody periods in
                    these countries' histories. I think the Carter policy had some effect, with Pat
                    Derian going down there and essentially saying, “Hey, you are killing people.” I
                    think that did make them at least slow down. I don't know whether you have ever
                    run into Tex Harris. Tex is well known. He was head of AFSA for a while. Tex was
                    in Buenos Aires as a political officer and as the human rights officer. Tex
                    almost got himself PNGed [expelled, declared persona non grata]. I don't know if
                    he did or not. He spent a tremendous amount of time with people like Emilio
                    Mignone, who had lost a daughter, and with other human rights activists,
                    essentially making the statement that the U.S. Government did care and that it
                    was trying to be supportive and to prevent further abuses. That did not sit well
                    with the military government and its supporters. By the time I became head of
                    Southern Cone Affairs in late 1980, there was little of that going on that we
                    were aware of. It had all been done. I think, in all, at leas8,000 people had
                    been killed.</p>

                        or werwe pressing for anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: We were pressing for accountability, not accountability in the sense of
                    punishment but rather an accounting, so that people would at least know if their
                    loved ones were alive or dead, so there would be some way of ending the agony of
                    not knowing. I'm not sure we were ever terribly successfully at that. I don't
                    remember pressing for any more at that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm pretty sure you were there during . . . You were there
                        fro1980 - 1982?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: As the head of the office, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Falklands/Malvinas business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: That took up the last four months or so of my time in the office. The
                    invasion of the Falklands was either March 31st, or April 1, 1982. For about a
                    month before that, there had been indications of unusual things going on, but we
                    did not think it meant anything serious. We thought the Argentines were testing,
                    probing, staging an incident here or there, just to keep the issue alive. Since
                    we didn't think it likely the Argentines would try to take the Falklands by
                    force, we dismissed any intelligence that seemed to point in that direction.
                    And, perhaps more important, we didn't make a concerted effort to find out what
                    they were really up to. There have been many failures of intelligence before and
                    since. Pearl Harbor is perhaps the most famous. Most intelligence, unless it is
                    very blatant, is shaped, distorted or ignored because of our mental constructs
                    of the particular moment or period.</p>
                <p>I don't know if you know the background, but the Falklands had been occupied by
                    Great Britain since 1834, or thereabouts. The Argentines claimed it before and
                    since. It has been a running issue. A few days before the invasion took place,
                    the British Ambassador came to the Department and saw the Deputy Secretary, Walt
                    Stoessel. He said they had good information that there was going to be an
                    invasion. We attempted to prevent it. There was a late night telephone call from
                    Reagan to Galtiere on the night of the invasion. Galtiere at first refused to
                    take it, and then said that it was too late to stop the invasion. Then, for
                    about the next almost three weeks, I was involved in the shuttle diplomacy with
                    Secretary of State Haig and a large retinue of others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Alexander Haig?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes. First, we flew off to London, then from London to Buenos Aires,
                    then back to London, then back to Washington. Then there was a second trip to
                    Buenos Aires and back, and perhaps also to London again, although I'm not now
                    sure of that. Enders was there. Vernon (Dick) Walters was there, and a lot of
                    other people. Then, when the shuttle effort failed, I was the head of the Task
                    Force in the Operations Center for the next two or three months while the crisis
                    played out, which was a very dreary business because I sat there while the
                    British came closer and closer and eventually retook the place. Meanwhile, there
                    was an air war of sorts. Ships were being sunk. There was a lot of unhappiness
                    in the hemisphere, which we tried to broker as best as we could, to preserve our
                    position. It was a difficult time in hemispheric relations.</p>
                <p>Q: Tell me, on the Haig shuttle, what was your impression of Secretary Haig, when
                    he first became involved? This obviously had not been very high or even on his
                    agenda before all hell broke loose, I take it.</p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes. In retrospect, I'm not sure why Haig decided to get personally
                    involved in this, other than, “Here is our closest ally, so to speak, in a
                    possible shooting war with part of our own hemisphere.” But one wondered if
                    there wasn't more behind it. Earlier, we had had the Kissinger shuttle in the
                    Middle-East, while Haig was in the White House, and maybe Haig wanted to have
                    his own shuttle to visibly, clearly, prevent something or resolve something. As
                    it turned out, he didn't succeed. I'm not sure Kissinger succeeded either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he or his immediate staff drawing on you to try to
                        figure ouwhat made these Argentinians, this junta, tick, and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: No, I don't remember being all that involved. There was a little
                    inter-circle at the top with Enders and Walters and the Secretary's immediate
                    staff. The rest of us were there to do whatever needed to be done as a result of
                    their discussions, or sometimes what they couldn't do or didn't want to do. I
                    did not really sit in on the policy discussions. In Argentina, I was used to
                    meet with groups that wanted to come in and talk with Haig. Haig wouldn't see
                    them, so I would see them. We didn't have any great Argentine expertise. I knew
                    a bit from having been Director for Southern Cone Affairs. I think Walters had
                    known some of the military.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was basically a Brazilian hand.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>SERVICE: Brazilian hand, but he had been to a lot of places a lot of times, so he
                    probably had met some of the military, and may have had a feel for them, some of
                    the upper military. Our ambassador in Argentina, Harry Shlaudeman, was a very
                    savvy guy. My direct knowledge of Argentina was minimal. I had been in Chile.
                    You don't learn very much being the country director in Washington. It turned
                    out that it was all futile. The Argentines had a chance. There was a moment
                    when, I think, Margaret Thatcher, might have been persuaded to halt the military
                    action. It was a risky action. It was costly and would take a long time. If the
                    Argentines had had the sense to withdraw and agree to some sort of arbitration
                    process, they might have ended up better off than before the invasion. But they
                    didn't have the sense to do that and we couldn't persuade them. At first they
                    really didn't think that Thatcher would carry through. They may even have
                    thought that if push came to shove, the U.S. was going to support them because
                    we are part of the same hemisphere, and they were helping us in Central America.
                    That didn't happen. They misjudged us, and they misjudged Margaret Thatcher.
                    Beyond that very small window, there was no turning back, as far as Thatcher was
                    concerned. She was too committed, and probably thought she could win, and she
                    did.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there any thought on the part of our ARA apparatus that the United States
                    might back the Argentines? I was an outsider on this issue. At this point, I was
                    getting ready to retire. But, it never occurred to me that we could do anything
                    but support Britain, since Britain was not only our closest ally, but also
                    because Argentina was a dictatorship. It just seemed like it was a done deal,
                    almost, that we would support Great Britain.</p>
                <p>SERVICE: No, I think there was some feeling in the Latin American part of the
                    State Department that, if not support Argentina, we ought to find a solution
                    which eventually would lead to realization of Argentina's aspirations. I think
                    to most of us who specialized in Latin America, there was a certain absurdity to
                    these 2,000 kelpers out on this island with very long and tenuous ties to Great
                    Britain. It was a holdover from a Colonial era, which no longer existed. There
                    was hope that we could find a solution short of war, because we all realized
                    that if it came to war we have no choice but to support Great Britain.</p>
                <p>Q: What about the rest of Latin America? What were we getting from our people in
                    other places? I understand, that obviously there should be great solidarity, but
                    if there is any country for whom there was less solid feeling, would be for most
                    of Latin America, but the Argentines.</p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes, you put your finger on it. Argentines, historically, have not been
                    loved by their neighbors in the hemisphere because they thought they were better
                    than anybody else. They were arrogant. And so while the predominant statements
                    were favorable to Argentina, the sentiments were not necessarily matched. Maybe
                    they were quite happy to see Argentina get what it was due. Of course, there was
                    the question of military rule and some of what the military had done while in
                    power had put the left against them, almost everywhere in Latin America. You
                    really had to be a very fierce regional loyalist to support Argentina
                    regardless.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>Q: While you were on the Task Force, what was it? Was it just a matter of
                    watching this very slow motion, this Armada going out of England and moving very
                    slowly toward there? Also, were we getting much good intelligence about what the
                    Argentines as far as preparing for the war?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: The first part of your question, yes. Essentially, we were just watching
                    it. Where are they now, and how soon are they going to be there? Once they got
                    there, there were weeks, as I remember, of the bombardment, and the Argentines
                    planes coming over from the coast, and sinking a number of ships. The Argentines
                    did very little. They sent over their rawest recruits. They did not think they
                    would ever have to fight. By the time they discovered they would, there was very
                    little they could do. I suppose there was a brief window there where they could
                    have sent over a lot more reinforcements. But I'm not sure they had them. When
                    it came right down to it, they were not a match for the Brits. There was an
                    episode when the British sank the cruiser, Belgrano, which was the old U.S.
                    cruiser St. Louis.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The old World War II American cruiser, a light

                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Built in 1938, or something like that. I think there were at least 700
                    lives lost. There was a great uproar throughout the continent. It was Belaunde,
                    the Peruvian President at that time, who tried to broker a solution at that
                    point to prevent further bloodshed. It was a very frustrating time because there
                    was nothing anybody could do unless the Argentines just voluntarily picked up
                    went home.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you have the general feeling that the Argentine rulers had gotten frozen
                    in the headlights? They didn't know what to do, they had started this, and
                    weren't really responding, just standing there.</p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes, we had that feeling. There were also insinuations I know are true
                    thaGaltiere drank a great deal and he was not capable of making sound decisions
                    a good bit of the time. I think they still had unrealistic expectations that
                    somehow the United Nations or whoever would pull their chestnuts out of the
                    fire, or they felt they just couldn't back down, because, obviously it was a
                    tremendously nationalistic issue in Argentina. I remember when we were coming in
                    from the airport with Haig; the airport is about 30 miles outside of town. It is
                    kind of like a Dulles access road highway. All the overpasses were hung with
                    banners, with people on them, all waving signs saying “las Malvinas son
                    nuestras,” or something like that. A lot of this was whipped up and organized.
                    At one point, when Haig was in the palace negotiating, there was such a crowd
                    outside, they had to take him out by helicopter back to his hotel. They whipped
                    all of this up and then they couldn't just withdraw. It was a tough
                    situation.</p>

                    last casualties counted, the prisoners taken and the British flag back up.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes. I was due to leave the Southern Cone job that summer (1982). I had
                    been on the task force for three or four months. My deputy basically ran the day
                    to day operations for our relations with the other countries of the area. I'm
                    not sure I ever went back, other than, maybe just to clean up a few odds and
                    ends. I left in early July. The Falklands were retaken by early June, mid-June,
                    and I think I was out of there by July. I went on to my next assignment.</p>

                <p>SERVICE: To Madrid.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, we're off to Madrid in 1982. One last question about this: Were you
                    dealing at all with Argentine affairs when the junta fell apart? That was on
                    somebody else's watch.</p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes. Quite clearly, the Falkland's debacle helped to end military rule
                    in Argentina. I think we could foresee that by the time I was leaving, but it
                    hadn't happened yet.</p>

                <p>SERVICE: I think I went there on a four-year assignment. At some point, I thought
                    of changing it to three years straight, but didn't. Then when we had finished
                    four, our daughter was a senior in high school. Furthermore, there had been a
                    lot of changeovers, including thDCM and ambassador at about the end of the
                    fourth year. So, the Department accepted my staying a fifth year. I was the

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political set up in Spain when you arrived
                        there i1982?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: First, let me say, I had been in the Foreign Service at that point for
                    21 years. Spain was the first democracy I served in. As a matter of fact, I
                    served in only democracies after that. Franco died in 1975 and he had designated
                    Juan Carlos to become the King over his father. The six years before I got
                    there, was a period of reinitiating democracy and a rather delicate time in some
                    respects. There was a famous incident in, I think, February of 1981. Some
                    Guardia Civil officers took over the Congress and shots were fired. People were
                    in there for a long time. The country survived that. All of a sudden, Juan
                    Carlos, who had been looked at as a rather difficult, not very bright, not very
                    capable, royal started to look pretty good. The country was ruled by moderates,
                    moderate-right governments from 1976 to 1982. There was still considerable fear
                    by those who had supported Franco and who remembered the Civil War. I got there
                    shortly before the election of 1982. The Prime Minister was Calvo Sotelo. The
                    election, in October, was won by the socialists led by Felipe Gonz�lez. That was
                    a very big step forward in healing wounds of the Civil War and strengthening
                    democracy. For that, Felipe Gonz�lez deserves a great share of the credit
                    because he is one of these people who is not antagonistic. Everybody seemed to
                    like him. He reassured everybody that “socialists” can come in and rule the
                    country sensibly. That was the situation when I got there, or very soon after I
                    got there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you give a little idea of what the political counselor
                        wadoing in Spain in a democracy at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>SERVICE: Well, we had a very large section to start with. We had about 10
                    officers and three or four secretaries. That is almost as big as the entire
                    embassy in Paraguay in terms of Foreign Service officers. We had a
                    political-military office, which actually was a separate section when I got
                    there. Later we combined the two. It dealt almost entirely with the bases issues
                    and Spain's membership in NATO. The rest of us tried to keep track of what was
                    happening in the evolving political situation in Spain, which was not
                    threatening, but there were a lot of people and parties we had not followed very
                    closely during all the years of Franco and which were in the process of
                    regeneration and change. We divided up the parties and leaders and tried to get
                    to know them and talk with them, your usual political reporting and
                    analysis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have some catching up to do with the socialists or
                        had wdeveloped pretty good terms with them already?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: There was a little bit of catching up to do, although some of my
                    predecessors in the political section had become close to some members of the
                    inner circle. By and large they were eager for contact because they saw this as
                    proving their democratic and non-extremist credentials. Soon after I got there,
                    but before Felipe was elected, we had a visit by George Shultz. I went to see
                    the foreign relations secretary in the Socialist Party, Elena Flores, and said
                    “We've got the Secretary of State coming. He would like to meet with Felipe. Any
                    problem?” They said, “No, no.” It was all set up. Felipe came to the
                    Ambassador's residence and they met there. Some of the elements of the Socialist
                    Party wanted to keep us at arm's length. They still had an ideological mind-set
                    that we were not really sympathetic to them or friendly. They tended to hold
                    against us our relationship with Franco in the 1950s, the bases deal, which in
                    their imagination, helped prolong the Franco regime. I don't think that is true,
                    but that is what some of them did believe. However, most of them, and certainly
                    the ones we got to know best, were friendly.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find that the cast of the Socialist Party was sort of doctrinaire as
                    far as nationalizing industry and various elements of the society?</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>SERVICE: No. They had changed greatly. This was Felipe's great accomplishment.
                    I've forgotten in which year, but there was a Socialist Party convention prior
                    to his winning office in 1982. Felipe insisted that they take out the explicit
                    Marxist reference in the basic document of the party, the PSOE (Partido
                    Socialista Obrero Espa�ol). This created a big conflict within the party, the
                    same thing the British labor party has gone through more recently. Felipe
                    resigned, but only briefly. The bulk of the party asked him to come back. They
                    knew they needed him. On one occasion Felipe is supposed to have said “Look, I'd
                    rather be mugged in New York, then live in Moscow.” He was very pragmatic, very
                    moderate. Soon after he came to power — this, you will remember, is following
                    Mitterrand's initial attempt to apply socialist economics in France, but soon
                    had to back off — Felipe said something along the lines o“Look, there are no
                    longer socialist economics and capitalist economics. There is only one economics
                    in the global marketplace, and if we want to participate and benefit we have to
                    have the sense to get on board.” There were socialist-controlled labor unions,
                    and there was a left wing of the party. The Vice President, Alfonso Guerra, was
                    widely considered to be leader of the left side of the party. But Felipe was the
                    commanding voice in the party, and was a moderate, is a moderate.</p>
                <p>Q: Were we able to keep track, of say, the unions, because the unions are always
                    such a powerful force in the socialist government? Did we have good contacts
                    with the unions?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: Good, but not close. We had a labor attache. He spent a certain amount
                    of time with them. The AFL-CIO [American Federation of Labor-Congress of
                    Industrial Organizations] was in one of those labor confederations with the
                    socialist-controlled unions, but it was not a close relationship. Most of the
                    unions in Spain, at that time, if I recall correctly, were either
                    socialist-dominated or communist-dominated. There was no Catholic, or
                    Christian-Democratic movement of any significance. We had a formally good
                    relationship, but not a close relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Communist party, internally within Spain at
                        thatime?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Fairly small, about 10 percent of the public, or even less by the time I
                    left. They, of course, were still proscribed in the immediate aftermath of
                    Franco's death. It was only in 1977 or 1978 when Adolfo Su�rez waPrime Minister,
                    that they were legalized. After the 1981 incident in the legislature (referred
                    to above), there was a massive national parade of solidarity. You had the
                    Communist leader marching arm-in-arm with Manuel Fraga, who had been a minister
                    under Franco and was the leader of the conservative party (Acci�n Popular). The
                    intent was to send a message, “We are all in favor of democracy. We are all
                    against military direction of the process.” At one point, I thought it would be
                    useful to get to know something about the Communist Party. Tom Enders was the
                    Ambassador then. I ran it through him, and he had no objection. I had lunch,
                    every so often, with somebody who was rising in the party, not somebody at the
                    top, but one of the younger lights.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there the feeling that the Soviet Union was still
                        trying tsort of fish in troubled waters or had that pretty well ceased?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: I don't remember much concern about the Soviets. We had certain
                    relations with the Communist party, but they were not Moscow-line Communists.
                    They were Euro-Communists, democratic Communists, whatever.</p>
                <p>Q: What about France? Did France play much of a role in Spain as we saw it? They
                    were so close in many ways. I was wondering whether the Spanish looked to the
                    French or to the French socialists, or anything.</p>
                <p>SERVICE: Spaniards have the feeling that the French look down on them. Just the
                    way the Brits used to look down on the whole continent, Africa starts at Calais,
                    or wherever. For the French, Africa starts at the Pyrenees. There wasn't any
                    great love lost between the Spaniards and the French, although, people like
                    Felipe and others had studied, spent some time in France and spoke French. There
                    were a couple of issues that counted. One was that Spain wanted to become a
                    member of the European community and the French position on that was very
                    important. And Spain wanted help with the Basque separatists, because, as you
                    know, there are French Basques, and there are Spanish Basques. The Spanish
                    believed that the French Basques provided refuge to the Spanish Basques. So that
                    was a continuing area of interest, friction, and perhaps some cooperation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of the Basques, did we have concerns that we

                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>SERVICE: Not a great deal. Although there was one incident when two rockets were
                    fired at the Embassy from one of the streets nearby. I can't say with certainty
                    that was a Basque operation, but it was the work of one of the terrorist groups
                    which may have had some affiliation with the Basques. In general, I think, our
                    attitude was that this was an internal Spanish matter. The Basque didn't have
                    any interest in getting us involved. Obviously, we supported the integrity of
                    Spain and we cooperated with the security services. Let me add one other thing.
                    There was some concern... This was the period when Central America was very hot.
                    We got reports from time to time that there were a lot of Basques in places like
                    Nicaragua, that they were members of ETA[Euskadi Ta Askatusuna, e.g. Basque
                    Homeland and Liberty]. We passed this onto the Spaniards and said, “You guys
                    ought to take a look at this. These are people who may be there because they
                    can't be here, or may have done things here, or are working actively with the
                    Sandinistas, offering their assistance,” and what not. The Spaniards sort of
                    shrugged. The Spanish position, the official position, was basically that we
                    shouldn't be doing what we are doing in Central America, that the problems there
                    were internal. They weren't eager in getting involved on our side, or against
                    the Sandinistas, even if this meant ignoring some Basque terrorist ties.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the Reagan administration perceived because of
                        CentraAmerica and also Grenada?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: It depended on whom you talked to, of course. I think, by the center to
                    the left, it was viewed in rather negative terms. Of course, you have to
                    remember that the Spaniards still view Latin America as, not their colony
                    anymore, not their empire anymore, but an area where they have a particular
                    expertise and a particular interest. In a sense, therefore, they view us as
                    their rivals for influence. They looked for anything we did which would play
                    poorly there and rejoice in it. That is probably too strong, but not inaccurate.
                    The left, in general, thought we exaggerated the communist menace. Latin America
                    had real social problems and we could not solve them by strengthening the right
                    to suppress dissent or by sending in military assistance. You have to let such
                    things play out, however, they are going to play out. They tended to downplay
                    the extent of Soviet influence and involvement, and to some extent that of Cuba.
                    ThSpanish right was somewhat more supportive of our policies in Latin America,
                    but not all that much.</p>

                <p>SERVICE: The Spanish government under the Socialists thought our policy a
                    mistake, and that we should be trying to build bridges to Cuba and to the Castro
                    government. I think most of them saw the eventual end of the Franco dictatorship
                    as the product of the gradually increasing interaction of Spain with the rest of
                    Europe, starting in the 1950s. The fact that you had millions of tourists coming
                    down to Spain every year from democratic countries, and the opening up of
                    cultural exchanges and access to publications of one kind or another, made it
                    very difficult to maintain a non-democratic regime in Spain. They thought the
                    same would happen in Cuba if we stopped isolating it.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you have a problem explaining our Cuban policy, because the way I see it,
                    I've never really dealt with it, but it's really determined by the very strong
                    Cuban exile movement in Florida, more than looking at it in any really rational
                    way?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: As one of our Assistant Secretary's of State for Latin America said when
                    asked a Cuba question, “I thought we were going to talk about foreign policy
                    today.” Yes. No question, because (1) the Spanish didn't think our policy was
                    the best policy; and (2) and they were also aware that it was driven by the
                    anti-Castro Cuban lobby to a significant degree. You'd have to explain, “Well,
                    you know, that is foreign policy in a democracy. All are allowed to express
                    their opinions and attempt to influence policy. We have our Israel lobby, we
                    have our Greek lobby, we have our China lobby. You may not agree with them, but
                    they certainly have a right to express their view.” They would sort of nod, but,
                    they still thought our policy was a mistake.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much of a contrast in the Embassy between the
                        way TerrTodman operated and Tom Enders?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Do you know them both?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I only know Todman vaguely, and just know much about
                        Enders. His sort of a legend in the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: I had three Ambassadors while I was there. I had Terry Todman the first
                    year, I had Tom Enders for the three middle years, and I had Reggie Bartholomew
                    for the fifth year. I must say they all three are/were (Enders is dead)
                    exceptional people, but in quite different ways. They were also, at times,
                    difficult to work with. It was a relief when I went to Argentina and Brazil and
                    had ambassadors who were more normal human beings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A little too close to the furnace.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>SERVICE: Terry Todman, was not well liked by the officers on the staff because of
                    his style, his way of running the Embassy. I would call it an imperial style:
                    “Everybody is here to support the Ambassador. Two hours of your time is not
                    worth even five minutes of the Ambassador's time.” In my view there was a lot of
                    make-work. A good bit of what we did was not really necessary but was done
                    because the Ambassador thought it just might be helpful to him in some way. By
                    the time I got to Madrid Todman had been there for four years. He knew all the
                    people. He knew all the issues. He knew the background. But he still wanted
                    briefing papers on everything and for every visitor. It seemed unnecessary
                    although, in fairness perhaps, Todman saw this as an educational technique for
                    the newer personnel. He was always trying to keep us up to snuff and making sure
                    we were doing the best job we could. One thing that was almost a fixation with
                    him was if he were the first one to hear of some piece of news, it made him
                    quite unhappy. He felt that we all should be listening to the radio or watching
                    television just as intently as he was, and somebody should have called him.</p>
                <p>Anyway, Tom Enders was totally different. Tom Enders was a superbly qualified,
                    extremely intelligent person. Sometimes he gave me the impression that he really
                    didn't need you at all because he could do it all himself, in half the time you
                    could do it. He was a much easier person to work with because he didn't make
                    what I would call “marginal demands” on people. If you had something important
                    to say, fine. Otherwise, you just did your job and interacted with him as
                    appropriate, but didn't dance attendance all the time.</p>
                <p>Reggie Bartholomew was a combination of the two. Reggie is an actor. He loves to
                    perform. We used to spend hours in his office, listening to Reggie think out
                    loud. He would say, “Now, I am going to say this to him, and then he is going to
                    say this to me, and then we are going to do this,” etc. It was his way of
                    working through things in his mind, of preparing himself. It was quite
                    entertaining for the rest of us, but also time-consuming and wearing. My tour
                    ended after a year with him, and by then his style of leadership had begun to
                    pall a bit. Each one of these men was very effective on the outside, despite
                    their different styles. It just proves that there are many ways to be a
                    successful ambassador. They were each interesting people in their ownrights.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our major interests in Spain at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>SERVICE: Our overriding interest was the military alliance. Spain had become a
                    member of NATO in about 1980, or maybe 1981. This was over the objections of the
                    Socialist Party, and the Communist of course. The Socialists said they would
                    take Spain out of NATO when they came to power. Later that position was modified
                    to say that the issue would be put to a referendum so that the Spanish people
                    could decide. The debate over NATO membership dominated the first three and a
                    half years I was there. After much delay, the referendum was finally held in
                    March, 1986. It was nip and tuck right up to the end. The polls, two weeks
                    ahead, which is the latest they could do them, showed that NATO membership was
                    probably going to lose. In fact, a small majority voted in favor.</p>
                <p>The NATO issue played back on the question of bases, although we had had the
                    bases for years without Spain being in NATO. But, that relationship was evolving
                    too. The Socialists had come in committed to renegotiating our military presence
                    in a downward direction. Ironically, the fact that continued membership was
                    approved may have made it more difficult to negotiate the kind of continued base
                    presence we preferred.</p>
                <p>Spain was important to us because of its relations with Latin America. Although
                    those relations were not as strong and as important as the Spaniards liked to
                    think, we consulted them. We tried to bring them along on issues we thought were
                    important and get their support. We also consulted them on Middle East and North
                    Africa matters. Spaniards see their country as a bridge to the Muslim world
                    because it had 700 years of Islam. I went to the Foreign Ministry and talked a
                    lot about Iran and Iraq, and also the problem with Morocco and the separatist
                    movement there. We tried to coordinate our policies, work together as best as
                    possible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this really a matter of sharing views or were there
                        anpossibilities for cooperation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: It was more sharing of views. The Spaniards did not have much of a
                    projection at that time outside of Spain. There was not much they could do to be
                    helpful in a real sense, apart perhaps from shipping or not shipping arms. We
                    tried to discourage shipping to whomever was our principal enemy at the moment.
                    It was Iran most of the time. We were arguing that Iraq was the good country and
                    Iran the bad guy. The Spaniards were not so sure. They were proved right, in a
                    sense.</p>
                <p>Q: Well back to NATO. What was in it for the Spaniards as far as we projected,
                    but also what was the thinking of the Spaniards as far as what was good about
                    NATO and what was bad about NATO?</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>SERVICE: The Spanish left still had a romantic idea of the brotherhood of
                    nations, and believed that military alliances are basically conservative and
                    reactionary and tend to work against the evolution of man and the move toward
                    socialism, and therefore are bad things. Very few had any rosy views of the
                    Soviet Union by that time, but that had this philosophical bias against military
                    alliances, particularly when the alliance is lead by an extra-continental power
                    like the United States. Those who were in favor of continued NATO membership
                    pointed out that Spain was at the same time trying to gain admission to the
                    European Economic Community [EEC]. It was unrealistic for Spain to want to enjoy
                    the economic benefits that came with being an accepted, democratic member of
                    Europe, without at the same time sharing the defense responsibilities. I think
                    that helped influence opinion to some degree. Probably, the Spanish military saw
                    membership in NATO as a channel for its modernization, for its becoming a
                    respectable, better qualified military force. There was some support in the
                    business community for joining.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Spanish Army? Were they becoming a smaller,
                        morefficient Army when you were there? Was NATO having an effect on
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: I don't know the figures. I think they had been in the process of force
                    reduction for quite some time, and there had been limited modernization. I don't
                    know how big they were at the time I was there, but it was not an oppressive
                    military presence. You never had the feeling that it was this huge, bloated
                    structure that had to be cut down by half or two thirds. It was still run by
                    people who had been around a long time. Some of them fought with Hitler on the
                    eastern front in the Blue Division in World War II.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was Spain responding during this time to the
                        EuropeaEconomic Union (ECU)?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: We used to call it EC, didn't we? I think it was thEuropean Economic
                    Community, which later became European Community [EC].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: There were petitioners to join. They had their requests in. I forgot
                    when it finally happened, whether it was January 1, 1986 or 1987. It was sort of
                    marching along. But there was a certain amount of doubt until it actually
                    happened. As I recall, France didn't oppose it and Germany didn't oppose it.
                    They were the ones who could have blocked it. In the European mind, Spain's
                    membership in the EC was seen as a way to preserve and strengthen democracy
                    there. More recently the same argument is being made with respect to the
                    countries of eastern Europe.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling that you were watching a positive
                        changin Spain, both economically and politically while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes, very much. It was an upbeat time to be there. I think the economy
                    generally did fairly well. Felipe projected optimism. His style was quite unlike
                    the name-calling we have around here. It was a time where they still felt they
                    should all work together. Felipe was the kind of guy whom even the opposition
                    had a hard time calling names. That is a nice situation to be in, particularly,
                    I suppose, if you are a Spaniard, but it is also nice for the foreigners looking
                    at the internal dynamics of the country.</p>
                <p>Q/ Was there any concern about the British and German takeover of the coast and
                    all? There were so many northern Europeans in the places along the coast that it
                    seemed to have turned them into Little Brightons or Little Hamburgs, or
                    something like that? Was there a certain xenophobia building up?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: I personally avoided them. I never went to those places. So, I can't say
                    whether this was the case or not. Certainly, there wasn't any that I noticed in
                    Madrid. There were not columns and articles about that. I think it was viewed
                    as, if you want to come down for a few weeks or a month each summer and spend
                    your money here, that is fine. There may well have been some at the local level,
                    but I never saw it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the media? Did you find that the media was a
                        normal,democratic-type media, covering the spectrum?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes, I would say so. There were conservative papers, the middle-of
                    the-road papers, those that were more leftists, etc. I'm sure there were things
                    on the far right too. Q: Did you have a problem with the American military? Were
                    there planes crashing or GIs getting drunk and doing things, and that sort of
                    thing?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes, there is always a certain amount of that, especially when you have
                    three major bases in Spain and a lot of little tiny things. Some of them were
                    radio stations, or this that and the other. We had been doing this since the
                    mid-1950s. There were established guidelines for how you handled the inevitable
                    problems that came up. It was all sort of automatic, hum-drum. I don't remember
                    any particular scandals.</p>

                    of these society things there was a lady whose name I can't remember, who is an
                    American citizen, but who is married to a local Count who had the ear of Nancy
                    Reagan, and was trying to depose Enders and take over the job. Was this actually
                    happening?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: The Countess of Romanones or something, and an author too,by the way.
                    She wrote the Spy Wore Red, something like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Spy Wore Silk Stockings, I think, or something like
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: She did a number of them. She was an OSS [Office of Strategic Services]
                    employee who went to Spain in the Second World War, worked in Madrid. She
                    married this Count Romanones. I'm not sure I ever met her. I heard the same
                    thing. I heard from somebody that she was out to get Enders. I'm not sure
                    exactly why, but it may have been true.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you find working with the society there? I would think it would be a
                    little bit of a problem just trying to carry on social duties because of the
                    hours.</p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes. But in some ways, it was not as bad as Latin America, some parts of
                    Latin America that I have been in. In Madrid, of course, lunch can start at 1:00
                    or 1:30, and you may not get back until 4:00 or 4:30, or 5:00 in an extreme
                    case. For dinners you weren't invited until about 9:00 or 9:30, but you ate
                    fairly promptly, and you might be out by 11:30 or 12, whereas in Latin America,
                    in some countries, you might be invited to come at 8:00, but wouldn't eat until
                    11:30 or 12:00. Of course, the Spaniards, themselves, wouldn't go into work
                    until 9:00 or 9:30 the next morning. The Embassy said that you had to be careful
                    about how late you stayed out, which is not usually a problem with me.</p>
                <p>Q: After the trying years in Spain, I take it by the time you left there, things
                    were all looking up and that it looked like a country well on its way to getting
                    involved in everything, becoming a solid member of Europe.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>SERVICE: I think that is fair to say. I think some of the more striking progress
                    has been made in the years since then. In late 1980s or early 1990s, they had a
                    good growth rate for a number of years, which helped. Unemployment is still
                    quite high, although one always has to wonder about the unemployment rate of
                    20%. It doesn't seem to get much lower. Whether that is really a valid figure, I
                    don't know. The Spaniards started investing abroad quite a bit in Latin America.
                    They have become an accepted part of Europe, a serious part of Europe, not a
                    basket case, not a poor relative. There is now a Spaniard as Secretary General
                    of NATO. The country has come a long way since that referendum in 1986.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you sort of staying up late at night and making
                        youpredictions and keeping your fingers crossed on the NATO referendum?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes. We were essentially. The polls a few days before vote still showed
                    a majority against staying in NATO. But we said that movement was in the right
                    direction and it might be enough to change the result by the day of the
                    referendum. And that is what happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anything we could do or was it a matter of just
                        siback and report?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: It was basically sit back and report. Of course we talked to everybody
                    we had contact with, but we weren't swinging many votes that way. In the final
                    analysis, the fact that it was pretty obvious Felipe Gonzalez and the King both
                    wanted Spain to stay in the Alliance carried the day.</p>
                <p>Q: What about the universities? In some countries, the universities, are, sort
                    of, a power of their own. Many of the students are usually taught by leftists in
                    the University and there are leftists in Latin America. Then, when they come
                    out, they turn into good, solid business people, and all that. Was Spain of that
                    caliber or was it different?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: It was not an issue while I was there, in part because the Socialists
                    were in power. There were no marches about national issues that I recall. It was
                    a fairly quiet time as far as university students went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in 1987, what were you hoping to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>SERVICE: I knew it was high time I became a DCM somewhere, as a stepping stone to
                    becoming Ambassador. There were also three DCMs while I was in Madrid. The first
                    one was Bob Barbour, and the second one was Jack Binns. When Jack Binns retired
                    in January of 1986, I had already asked for an extension. I was going to be
                    there for another year and half. I asked if I could bDCM for the remaining year
                    and a half. I talked to Enders about it, and he had no objection to my taking
                    the position. I was in Washington and talked with George Vest about it. Vest
                    said “We have already chosen a DCM, who will come in September of 1986. You can
                    be DCM until then. We will give you the title and everything.” I was DCM for
                    nine months in 1986. Then, Adrian Basora came and was the DCM for the last nine
                    months that I was in Madrid. Bob Gelbard was the Deputy Assistant Secretary of
                    State for Inter-American Affairs. He apparently decided that I would be a good
                    candidate to be DCM in Buenos Aires. There was a certain amount of
                    back-and-forth with the Ambassador in Buenos Aires, whose name was Theodore
                    Gildred, a political appointee from San Diego. We talked on the phone a few
                    times. He also talked with Reggie Bartholomew (our new ambassador in Madrid) and
                    I sent a memorandum about myself, and he said, “Fine.” So, I went to be DCM in
                    Buenos Aires, directly from Madrid in July of 1987.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Buenos Aires from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: From July of 1987 to November of 1989.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back to Spain. You were there just after the Falkland's
                        War?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes.</p>
                <p>Q: How was that playing? At a certain point, we came down, and tried to be an
                    honest broker, but we ended up by supporting the British. Was that a problem in
                    Spain?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: As I recall, the Spaniards had a rather equivocal position. Their
                    sympathies were with Argentina, in part because Spain has its own long-standing
                    territorial dispute with the UK [United Kingdom] over Gibraltar. But, because
                    they were both members of the NATO, Spain had not taken a position against the
                    UK. They tried to straddle the issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, Argentina had such an odious government,
                        anyway, athe time. It was not for democracy. It was not an easy one to
                        support.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: And, there had been the intense repression in the preceding years, which
                    many in Spain didn't condone or approve of. I probably told various of my
                    Spanish contacts about my role in the Falklands affair, but I don't remember
                    much explicit criticism of our policy.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>Before we leave Spain, I want to record an incident that is of some historical
                    interest. I've forgotten exactly which year, but there was an incident in the
                    Gulf of Sidra involving U.S. and Libyan planes. The Reagan administration
                    decided to strike back at Libya using bombers based in England. The question was
                    how they would get to Libya, would any of the intervening countries give
                    overflight rights. Enders was the Ambassador at the time. He was told to see
                    Gonz�lez and make a request. As I recall, Gonz�lez did not say okay, but he did
                    say something to the effect that they probably wouldn't notice if we did fly
                    over Spanish territory. In the end, we elected to fly over the water, sending
                    the planes down the Atlantic and then in through the Strait of Gibraltar. But
                    the Spaniards, and particularly Felipe, got at least half marks on this one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1987, what was the situation like in Argentina?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: You'll recall that the military lasted about one year after the
                    Falklands war. Then, they had elections and the Radicals won over the Peronists,
                    which surprised many people. In Spain, too, this was viewed as positive. The
                    Radicals were seen as a more serious party. They were going to try to restore
                    democracy and growth, and what not. I'm not sure exactly why, perhaps because
                    the Radicals themselves were split, or because they were still clinging to
                    outdated, perhaps never valid, policies, their administration was not very
                    successful. By the time I got there, in 1987, it was becoming very shaky,
                    indeed. Things were not going well. There was a military revolt at Easter time,
                    in 1987, before I got there, which was nip and tuck for a few days. The economy
                    was doing poorly. They had a number of stabilization plans, but inflation was
                    going up rapidly. It was a difficult time.</p>
                <p>Q: You went from one major Embassy to another major Embassy. Did you find a
                    difference in atmosphere and operating style in Buenos Aires than you had in
                    Madrid?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: You mean, within the Embassy itself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes, and don't forget this was the first time I had ever served with a
                    non-career ambassador. I don't know if you need to know that, but it is a fact.
                    Then too, I was DCM for the first time, which put me into a different category
                    from what I had been in more recently. I found it to be a very enjoyable
                    experience. Ted Gildred grew up in Mexico, and he spoke Spanish almost as if it
                    were his native language. He knew the Latin culture and mentality. He abhorred
                    the routine paper work that most of us spend most of our time doing in this
                    business. Therefore, by-and-large, he just didn't do it. I would guess that he
                    spent an average of three days per week in the office. That was probably the
                    maximum. That was okay, because he would do the important things. He would go to
                    see the President. He would go to see the Foreign Minister. He left us the nuts
                    and bolts of everything else we do, to us meaning the professionals. He didn't
                    second guess, which was very nice. It was a very pleasant relationship. He took
                    considerable concern in morale and did not forget the FSNs [Foreign Service
                    nationals]. He held meetings with them every four months or so. For a good part
                    of the time he did his own thing, whether it was playing golf or polo, or
                    flying, or driving racing cars, or fishing, or hunting, you name it. But he was
                    there when he was needed.</p>
                <p>Q: I would think that Argentina would be a difficult country to cover because you
                    have Buenos Aires and then you have... It's a large country. I was wondering,
                    what do you do?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: What we did was to send out little parties of embassy people every so
                    often. We sent them up to C�rdoba, and we sent them over to Mendoza, and to all
                    sorts of other places. Gildred tried to do it en masse for a while. He and six
                    or seven people would go off together, an officer from the Commercial Section,
                    from Consular, from USIS, etc. They would go off and talk with the governor,
                    local leaders, the business community, any resident Americans, and then come
                    back and write a report. It was fun and to a certain extent useful. But the fact
                    of the matter is that Argentina is much like France; most of what is important
                    happens in Buenos Aires, or you could find somebody in Buenos Aires who knew
                    about it. You were never quite certain when you went out on expeditions whether
                    it was much more than glorified sightseeing. It was pleasant to get out. But
                    were you really doing anything that couldn't have been done almost as well in
                    Buenos Aires?</p>
                <p>Q: It's one of those things - you're dammed if you don't do it, in a way. It
                    always leaves open the charge that you don't really understand what is happening
                    out in the country, or is that not the case in Argentina?</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes to some extent it is the case. But what's happening out there
                    usually isn't very important except when the situation becomes extreme. We
                    weren't really in that kind of situation most of the time. The only time we got
                    close to it was at the very end of the Alfonsin period. Alfonsin did not
                    complete his electoral mandate. Things got so bad economically that he stepped
                    down early. I think Alfonsin was supposed to hand over the reigns of the
                    government to Menem in December. In fact, he got out in July. He said, “I can't
                    do anything. Let a new president with a new mandate try to stop the rot.” It's
                    the only place I've ever lived where we got into what is really hyperinflation.
                    It got up to 200% in one month. When the inflation gets that high the economy
                    stops working. The stores aren't restocked. Prices in stores, especially in
                    grocery stores or pharmacies, get out sync with each other. Things that used to
                    be twice as expensive as something else are now cheaper than something else
                    because one happened to raise its price that day, and the other one hadn't yet.
                    You had situations in which, and this did cause a riot, they would call out in
                    supermarkets that prices were all going up 10% right then. You hadn't even
                    checked out and there was 10% more on your bill. So, there was some rioting as a
                    result of that, but none of which threatened the basic stability of the
                    country.</p>
                <p>Q: During this period, Alfonsin was obviously going down, and Menem was the man
                    who was coming up and Menem was a Peronist. Before he came in, what was our
                    view, how were we looking at this?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: We had good contacts with them because they realized that ever since the
                    1940s the U.S. Government and Peronism had had very few good things to say about
                    one another. They wanted to overcome that if they could. We wrote a cable in
                    January of 1989 which essentially said that just looking at the history of our
                    relations and policies over the past 10, 20, 30 years, or whatever, we should
                    hope that the Radicals win the election again. There was no clear basis for
                    thinking that Menem would be any different than his Peronist predecessors. His
                    loss was probably the best outcome from our point of view. But we don't rule out
                    a possibility that the Peronists, if they won, would be looking for and
                    interested in good relations, and that they would do some things that the
                    country needed. More than the Radicals, they might have the ability to do it. We
                    left open that possibility, and some of us actually believed there was a good
                    possibility things would turn out that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we see this as something with the man or the
                        movement?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>SERVICE: It was not limited to one man by any means. He had to have advisors and
                    so forth. Menem was the one who was able to pull it off. When I say it, I mean
                    the rather radical changes in national policy that he was able to institute.
                    Menem had enough charisma to be able to carry his party with him. The one I knew
                    best of that group was Guido DiTella, who is currently the Foreign Minister. He
                    was Ambassador in Washington during the first part of the Menem administration.
                    Before Menem was elected, I used to have lunch with Guido every so often. I
                    remember asking him one time whetheMenem really understood anything about
                    economics. He said, “No, not really. But, he is a good listener, and very
                    receptive. He understands if you explain the importance of it to him.” It was
                    people like DiTella, and Cavallo who is generally viewed as the main architect
                    of the economic policy, who were able to persuade Menem that Argentina had to
                    make basic changes in the way the country had been run for the past 40 or 50
                    years if it was ever going to get straightened out. And Menem did that.</p>
                <p>Q: It has always been, . . . I won't say, a puzzlement, but here is Argentina,
                    which is probably the most European of the Latin American countries, . . .?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes, it and Uruguay and Chile to some extent are alsimilar.</p>
                <p>Q: It seems to have absorbed all of the worst elements of political life for so
                    long. It has great riches and just misused them for so long.</p>
                <p>SERVICE: The connection is the dependence on land as the main status symbol in
                    these countries. Anybody who got ahead wanted to have a big hacienda somewhere.
                    It had a very stultifying effect on Argentina's political development, as on
                    that of most other Latin American countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did our contacts cut across various elements of this
                        societpretty well, classes and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: As much as you can in a big metropolis like Buenos Aires. We knew a lot
                    of businessmen. We had some contact with labor through our labor attache. USIS
                    and the younger officers tried to get close to the students. The Political
                    Section dealt with the overt political class more directly. We had the usual
                    range of contacts across the parties and economic sectors.</p>
                <p>Q: During this period, did we get involved in hunting down the last remaining
                    Nazis who were keeping a low profile in Argentina at that point, or was that
                    just not on our agenda?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: I don't remember any U.S.- related identifications while was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the nuclear issue? This concerned us for
                        sometimwith Argentina.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes, nuclear, and then missiles. They have a nuclear research complex
                    near Bariloche, and we were concerned about what they were doing. We kept an eye
                    on it as best we could. They had one or two nuclear power plants. We were
                    concerned they might try to export enriched uranium to countries like Iran. But
                    there was no real crisis in our nuclear relations while I was there. We
                    maintained a good relationship. We cultivated their nuclear people to try to
                    know what they were up to, and provided them with safety training if they wanted
                    it. While I was there, missile proliferation was more of a concern. At some
                    point the Argentine Air Force had decided that it ought to build missiles and
                    sell them around the world. They saw this as a way to obtain foreign currency to
                    buy the arms they wanted. They had a fairly advanced missile program which they
                    had developed in collaboration with Egypt, as I recall. That bothered us very
                    much. We spent a lot of time on it. Later, after I had left, we finally
                    convinced them to give up the missile export project.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about relations with Brazil and Chile during that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Relations with Chile were always a bit tense because of the long border
                    and because a substantial number of Chileans live in the South of Argentina. The
                    Argentines felt that Chile might try to claim some of the area, and they felt
                    they should maintain adequate forces at the border or kick them out. They had
                    almost gone to war in 1978 over the Beagle Channel. There was no love lost on
                    either side of their relationship. Brazil was the major country in South America
                    and for most of the century the Argentines saw themselves as their equal in
                    economic and military power. That had clearly changed by the time I had come
                    there. The Argentines recognized that they lost that race. They were no threat
                    to Brazil, and much like Canada in relation to us, more or less had to assume
                    that the Brazilians were not a threat to them. There was not as much security
                    tension left. Economic problems, of course, are another matter. Later, after I
                    left Argentina, Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay signed the Mercosur
                    Agreement to form a common market. Chile was a member-in-waiting. More
                    traditional concerns and frictions either disappeared or, at least, dropped
                    sharply.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find that the United States was playing any particular role, or was
                    the main thing to stay out and keep a benevolent eye on things?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: In Argentina, particularly?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. SERVICE: You mean, in its relations with its
                        neighbors?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>SERVICE: Certainly in the case of the Beagle Channel we had urged caution and
                    prudence on both sides. In general, our arms sales policy to the countries of
                    Latin America had been closely circumscribed from the Carter period on, and so
                    selling major weapon systems was not an issue. Even so, we looked at all
                    requests for lesser systems, upgrades, repairs, etc. in terms of the balance of
                    power in the region. When in doubt, we tended to come down on the side of not
                    selling or giving arms. To that extent, we were involved.</p>
                <p>Q: With regards to ARA and our embassies, was this an upbeat time? Here was
                    Argentina going through a real election and in other places, things were
                    changing more toward really participatory democracies. Was this a good time or
                    was there much of a feeling that things were changing?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: Viewed from Argentina, I think it was a time of considerable concern.
                    The feeling was that the brave new democracy which had been launched in 1983
                    possibly wasn't going to make it because of built-in rigidities, the inability
                    to modernize, and to make changes in the economic sphere. We had real concern.
                    Brazil, where I got to in 1989, was further behind than Argentina, and was still
                    adjusting, adapting. Of course, in Chile, there was the question of how long
                    Pinochet-instituted reforms could last, and what would come after. It was not a
                    time of euphoria in Latin America relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left in 1989, more or less, with the change
                        oadministration, when the Bush administration came in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: I left in November of 1989. Bush had been in for almost a year. Terry
                    Todman had come down iJune or July of 1989 and I was here for another five or
                    six months before I went to Brasilia to be DCM to Rick Melton. He had succeeded
                    me in Nicaragua as a junior officer many years earlier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Brasilia from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: From November of 1989 to August of 1992.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Very much like me. We are very similar. He is a professional, subdued,
                    thoughtful, and careful about details. He likes to know what is going on and
                    then follows up. He is very low-key, not emotional. He is a very decent person,
                    a very sound person, and has excellent judgment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've done an interview with him. You had been in Brazil
                        beforhadn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes, I served in Brazil from 1963 to 1965 in Bahia, the olcapital.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Brazil you went to in
                        1989?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Well, of course, I was in Brasilia. It is not an impression of anything,
                    other than suburbia. It is not a city. There is no center. You have to work hard
                    to occupy your time because there is no culture, there are no stores to speak
                    of. It takes no time to get anywhere. All of the things that consume time in a
                    normal city, you don't have. Well, what do you do? People who liked it were the
                    ones with a lot of kids. It was a good place to raise them. Those who liked to
                    play golf and tennis, and other outdoor things were very happy. I suppose there
                    may have been a few others who liked it for special reasons. But, it is not the
                    real world. Brasilia is not the real anything. It hadn't changed much at all, a
                    little more built up, than when I had seen it first in 1965. Brazil, itself, was
                    poorer, not poorer in an absolute sense, but in a sort of psychological sense.
                    Rio had become one of the most dangerous cities in the world if you want to
                    believe our listings. And I do believe them in this case. Almost everyone in our
                    Consulate General had had something happen to him or her. At most posts, that is
                    a rarity. Brazil was going through a tough time for a variety of reasons,
                    primarily because the economic model had run out of stream, and because of the
                    vast disparities in income.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the government like at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>SERVICE: I don't know how much you know of modern Brazilian history, but the
                    military had run the place from 1964, when I was there the first time, until, I
                    think, 1986. They agreed to step back at that point. The person who was to
                    become President was elected, indirectly, but then died before he could take
                    office. That was Tancredo Neves. His Vice President, Jose Sarney, became
                    President. He was not an inspired or inspiring leader. I can't say that he was a
                    bad one, but he was not a new broom, or new brain, or anything else. I got there
                    just before the next presidential election. It turned out there were two of
                    them. They have a system where if you don't get 50% the first time, you have a
                    run-off with whomever finished second. There was a certain amount of excitement
                    over a young politician from Alagoas, a poor northeastern state. Fernando Collor
                    de Melo. He was only about 40. He was physically attractive, modern supposedly.
                    He was the man who would lead Brazil into a bright new future. It was exciting
                    to be there at the time. His main opponent was Lula, the leader of the Labor
                    party. That, of course, worried the more conservative part of the population.
                    Anyway, Collor won and everybody wanted to see what he could do. He wasn't very
                    successful, and not entirely for reasons of his own making. Brazil is a very
                    hard country to govern. It has a multiplicity of parties. The parties don't have
                    much discipline. People move in and out of parties with great abandon. They have
                    a federal system. I doubt if it gives more power to the states than we do here,
                    but in a country with Brazil's history and its poverty and its inequities,
                    federalism in some ways makes it harder to govern. Collor was eventually forced
                    out of office because of rather blatant corruption. We were surprised. We had
                    reasonable hopes that he would be a progressive president, and would do some
                    important things. It turned out to be a rather tawdry episode in Brazilian
                    political history.</p>
                <p>Q: Was it that the political system was essentially corrupt and this was the
                    first time somebody was being called on it or was he corrupt more than was
                    generally accepted in that society?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: Don't forget you had 20 years of military government. I suspect, at the
                    beginning at least and maybe throughout, the Presidents were pretty honest and
                    clean. I think the Brazilian military has a considerable degree of discipline
                    and self-regard, and they had their brother officers looking over their
                    shoulders. It was not common to have massive corruption at the top. Perhaps
                    before the period of military rule there had been. But I think the country had
                    come to expect more. Collor certainly promised more. Because he was so young,
                    there was a temptation to think he was some brilliant politician. They found out
                    that this guy was as bad or worse than the rest of them. I think that was
                    disillusioning. Furthermore, we in the United States had demonstrated you could
                    impeach a President. The Brazilians figured out that even in Latin America it
                    was possible to impeach a President who breaks the rules excessively.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you talking with the various political powers during this time? First,
                    were you beginning to see the discontent coming and building-up on this new man?
                    Were they looking to the United States and asking us how we got rid of Nixon,
                    and that sort of thing?</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>SERVICE: As DCM I really didn't do much outside the Embassy. I did more in Buenos
                    Aires than I did in Brasilia. But, as you know, the DCM job is mainly to run the
                    Embassy and make sure everybody else is doing his or her job, while not
                    interfering too much with what they are doing or their contacts. I, personally,
                    was not talking with a lot of politicians. The Brazilians do not look to the
                    U.S. for guidance or support the way some of the smaller Latin American
                    countries do. Some may have expressed interest in the possible precedents from
                    our own experience, but basically they handled it their way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any particular issues that involved you at all,

                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: I might tell an amusing anecdote. At one point, we were going to have a
                    visit by President Bush. In fact, he eventually came. He came twice while I was
                    there. Once was to the Rio Environmental Conference in 1992, but this was
                    earlier. The White House advance people, as normal, got in touch, and said, “We
                    want to do something environmental. Let's check out Manaus.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Manaus being?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Manaus being a city on the Amazon, about halfway up. There are two main
                    cities. Belem is further down river. Manaus is where the Rio Negro joins the
                    Amazon. I met them in Manaus. We took them around to various major research
                    places, this, that and the other thing, the Smithsonian project, the monkey man.
                    We went down the Negro to the confluence of its clear waters with the silty
                    waters of the Amazon, we even saw a pink porpoise or two. They kept saying, “No,
                    no, it won't do.” Finally, I was at my wit's end. There was a nice hotel there,
                    called the Tropical, and there was a tourist boat that goes across the river and
                    back. So we hired it and did the standard tourist tour across the river, a
                    little walk in the jungle, something to eat and drink and then back. The advance
                    people were delighted. It was manageable and it gave the right picture shots.
                    That it had nothing to do with science or preserving the environment didn't
                    matter. It was a classic example of appearance over substance. I guess that is
                    what advance people are supposed to be good at.</p>
                <p>Q; Absolutely, this is their business. Timing depends what news sho. . . when the

                <p>SERVICE: Following up on that, we did have the World Environmental Conference in
                    Rio in 1992. I sort of ran our operation. I was the nuts and bolts man to make
                    sure everybody had an escort officer who needed one, that planes were met, etc.
                    I spent two weeks at a hotel in Rio while this was going on. President Bush came
                    for his second visit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the role of our Consulate General in Sao Paulo?
                        Is thialmost an entity unto itself, or was this integrated with
                        Brasilia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Have you interviewed Myles Frechette?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, somebody else has. I just interviewed Niles Bond, who
                        did isometime before.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Is Bond still around?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, he came down from Connecticut last week. He was 84
                        or 85. He was talking about how this is a different world.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Bond was the Consul General in S�o Paulo, when I first went to Brazil in
                    1963. S�o Paulo has always considered itself almost an embassy, or better put a
                    second embassy because of the importance of S�o Paulo, and also the fact that
                    you usually had people in that job who had been ambassador somewhere else. This
                    didn't happen always, but quite often. It can create friction from time to time.
                    One ambassador, it may have been John Crimmins, insisted that all reporting, for
                    both Rio and S�o Paulo come to the embassy for review before going on to
                    Washington. They couldn't just send a copy to the embassy. We didn't do that
                    when I was there, but I called up the CG in S�o Paulo from time to time to
                    remind the Consul General that he was part of the Country Team.</p>
                <p>Q: I've been told that most of the political class, except those with children,
                    gets the hell out of Brasilia on the weekends. Is this still true? And also that
                    most official Americans would rather be in Rio.</p>
                <p>SERVICE: Less than it used to be. A lot of people eventually made their peace
                    with Brasilia. They got used to the more relaxed life style. Our presence in Rio
                    has continued to be fairly large because we had this embassy building there,
                    which we held onto all this time. It was easy-pickings for any agency which
                    wanted to set up a regional office. We had the Library of Congress there with 25
                    or 30 people, mostly Brazilians. The FAA [Federal Aviation Administration] had
                    an office. So did the Defense Mapping Agency. And there were various others.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>Q: Back in the 1960s, I guess it was, Jack Tuthill went through what was known as
                    Operation Topsy, which was to cut down on the American presence in Brazil, which
                    had grown immensely. But, I am told that after he left, there was sort of
                    gradual creep and we had an awful lot of people there again.</p>
                <p>SERVICE: When I was there in the early 90s, we had slightly less than 400
                    Americans. But, spread around the embassy, two large Consulate Generals, and two
                    smaller consulates, . . . I think we looked for places we could reduce, but
                    there wasn't any major reduction to be done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess, too, when Tuthill was there, we had a very large
                        AIpresence.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes, we had 1,000 people there. A lot of that was reduced. The Peace
                    Corps was the largest in the world, and it departed in the 1970s. The Brazilians
                    told us they wanted it to leave. There was no Peace Corps when I was there. AID
                    was three Americans. The military had been cut way back. We used to have a big
                    military presence there. USIA was in the process of cutting back. It had always
                    had big operations in Rio and in S�o Paulo.</p>
                <p>Q: As you mentioned before, Brazil never really had a strong orientation toward
                    the United States. Was it Latin American centered, or how about ties with
                    Europe?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: I disagree with you there. Brazil, until at least the 1960s, was perhaps
                    the closest country in South America to the U.S. They decided that because we
                    were both continental size countries, had federal forms of government and
                    racially mixed populations, there was a lot of commonality in our two
                    experiences. This began to change after the military took power in 1964. I think
                    the Brazilian elites realized that the relationship was lopsided. They had been
                    attributing much more importance to it than we did. They were depending on the
                    U.S. to be the guiding light and so forth. When we didn't reciprocate
                    adequately, when they realized that our priorities were not necessarily the same
                    as theirs, when we started to put human rights and non-proliferation at the top
                    of our agenda, they felt that they ought to reduce the importance of the U.S.
                    relationship substantially, and start to look elsewhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We weren't the big brother or anything like that at that
                        point.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>SERVICE: Historically Brazil had a military rivalry with Argentina. That is no
                    longer the case, in part, because Brazil had so far surpassed Argentina in
                    economic size and power. Therefore thU.S. is no longer needed as a potential
                    balance against Argentina. As mentioned, Brazil and the U.S. diverged sharply on
                    a variety of issues in the 1970s and early '80s. Meanwhile it became possible
                    for the first time to think in terms of an alliance of the South American
                    countries, at least economically, with Brazil at the center because of its size.
                    It's only now, after all these changes, that U.S./Brazil relations are starting
                    to improve and to move back somewhat in the direction of where they were before
                    1965. But they will never go back to where they were because Brazil has greater
                    confidence and more options.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were we seeing the economy of Brazil during this
                        period, 198- 1992?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: There was a certain amount of optimism when Collor launched his
                    stabilization plan in March of 1990, when he came into office. But, it didn't
                    last very long. It started breaking down very quickly. They really didn't make
                    much progress in resolving a lot of the basic, underlying problems. There was
                    little progress in reducing the size of government or the degree of state
                    direction of the economy. Only now, under President Cardoso are they starting to
                    have some success in bringing about the needed reforms. This has only been in
                    the last year or two. Some of the needed change depends on revising the
                    constitution. The constitution written in the late 1980s was a backward-looking
                    constitution. It permitted, even encouraged, the country to retain a highly
                    nationalistic, import-substitution model of development. When it was written,
                    the world was moving in a different direction. Now the Brazilians are trying to
                    undo it, but over a lot of opposition from entrenched interests.</p>
                <p>Q: Now, when the President who was removed for corruption, . . . his name, again,
                    was?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: Fernando Collor de Melo.</p>
                <p>Q: Were we watching the military to see whethe. . . if the political leaders
                    didn't take care of this, did it have any appetite to do anything, or did they
                    say, “The hell with this.”</p>
                <p>SERVICE: Our sense was they were still recovering from their 20 years in power.
                    They realized that they did not have the answers to a lot of the country's
                    problems, and that the civilians had to work it out as best as they could. They
                    weren't going to try to impose their answers. They didn't have any good
                    answers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They didn't want to get involved again. How did your

                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>SERVICE: My family at that point consisted of my wife and myself. Our kids were
                    in college. They came down at vacation time and I think they enjoyed that. My
                    wife found it rather unexciting. She had a few close friends and they did things
                    together. Within two or three hours of Brasilia there were a number of small
                    towns, selling gem stones or various types of handicrafts. You could buy a
                    Topaz, or some other semi-precious stone for not too much. That would take up a
                    certain amount of time. There were a few other extracurricular activities. We
                    played tennis. I played golf.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds as exciting as Canberra?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Or Washington during its early history. Although Washington was probably
                    always nearer to larger places than Brasilia was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, why don't we pick this up the next time in 1992,
                        wither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: In 1992, I was leaving Brasilia for Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: By then, I was in the position of having been DCM two times, and wanting
                    an embassy, but nobody was offering me one. Nobody was offering me any job
                    really at that point. A guy named Roger Gamble, with whom I had worked in Mexico
                    City twenty or more years before, called me up one day. He said, “How would you
                    like to come work for me in FMP (Financial and Management Policy)?” A gal named
                    Jill Kent was head of it. She had been brought in from the outside. Roger came
                    from being the Deputy Chief of Mission in Mexico.</p>
                <p>Anyway, Roger said, “Why don't you come work for me? I need somebody who can do
                    projects and troubleshoot.” I said, “Fine.” I thought it could be interesting.
                    It was better than walking the corridors. I came back to Washington in August or
                    September of 1992, and went to work for Roger.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in that particular job from 1992 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Well, 1994. But, it sort of changed its nature in the course of things.
                    The first thing he asked me to look after was the Special Embassy Program. I
                    don't know if you are familiar with that.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, but we should explain it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: The Special Embassy Program was set up sometime in the 1980s. The idea
                    was we really don't need an embassy everywhere, but policy said we should have
                    one everywhere. In some of these very small countries, the Pacific Islands, some
                    of the countries in sub-Saharan Africa, a few in Latin America, you really don't
                    need very many people. They wanted to try to figure out how they could get by
                    with three, or four, or five Americans, and reduce the reporting requirements on
                    them, and reduce the administrative problems to the maximum extent. By the time
                    I arrived in Washington in 1992, I think there were about 50 special embassies.
                    Every circular cable that went out had to be cleareFMP to make sure it was
                    something that really needed go to the smaller posts. The idea was to reduce the
                    workload. Anyway, they wanted me to look at it and see if I could develop
                    criteria: Why are some posts special embassies, and why are other ones not,
                    especially if they are the same size? Ambassadors would complain “Why is my
                    embassy not a full-fledged embassy like everybody else's?” Some ambassadors felt
                    that it demeaned their own importance if their embassy was a Special Embassy. I
                    worked on that for a while. Then I made or found other work to do. I brought
                    some of it along today. I looked at the efficiency report. I don't know if you
                    remember how it used to have five boxes about potential — one, two, three, four,
                    five. They went up in a straight line. The fifth box said, splendid,
                    magnificent, what a wonderful person, and what a great future he or she has. The
                    fourth box was a little less glowing, and so on down to the first box, which
                    basically described the person as incompetent. The question was whether these
                    box ratings meant anything anymore. What was the average box that was being
                    given to an employee? Four? I think I had a bet with someone. I said that I
                    think it was higher than four. I went into the personnel files and I ended up
                    going through 30,000 EERs [Employee Evaluation Reports] for the previous five
                    years. I recruited various junior officers to work with me, and we compiled the
                    box scores for those 30,000 EERs. Do you know what it turned out to be? On a
                    scale of one to five, what was the average box score?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Probably four.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: 4.35, something like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's high. I would have thought even in...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>SERVICE: I put that all together. Everybody who rated anybody during those five
                    years was listed, showing the number of reports they did and what their average
                    score was and what the breakdown was between one, two, three, four, and five. Of
                    course, you get some people who never gave it a bit of thought. The higher their
                    position in the Department, the more likely they were to do that. Their
                    argument, I suppose, was that only the best people worked for them. It was very
                    revealing. I sent the report up to the Director General. I think it contributed
                    to eliminating the box scores. My proposal was somewhat different. I suggested
                    that instead of one to five, they make it one to twenty. Then, you could
                    reasonably give someone a 15 the first year, a 16 the next, and a 17 or even
                    higher the final year. But, they never did that. The report took a fair amount
                    of time and numerous paper cuts, but it was intriguing.</p>
                <p>Q: I would like to go back to the Special Embassy Program. What was your
                    evaluation, how that was working? Were you able, really, to cut out the tasks,
                    and to make sure that the system works?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: Mixed results. We tried to cut out things. There was resistance, and
                    sometimes the powers that be said, “Oh, no, it has to be done. It is a legal
                    requirement.” We did get some of the reporting reduced. That led into another
                    project later, when we got reporting reduced still further. There used to be a
                    whole bunch of required reports coordinated by INR [Bureau of Intelligence and
                    Research], many of which responded to requirements from other agencies or
                    departments. Some of these things had been on the books for years, literally.
                    Nobody stopped to think that maybe we didn't really need a particular report
                    anymore, or that there might be a better way of getting the information. With a
                    little prodding, we got some of those reports eliminated or reduced. We also had
                    some success in getting newer equipment for the Special Embassies, which in most
                    cases made life easier. But the constant problem was that embassies tended to
                    grow. We started off with most of the posts in the ex-Soviet Union as part of
                    the Special Embassy Program. Then, of course, they got an AID program, and then
                    maybe a Peace Corps program, or this or that. Probably, in some cases it was
                    justified. In other cases it was more because some agency thought that that was
                    a hot place to be. Sometimes it was an Ambassador who wanted to build his empire
                    a little.</p>
                <p>Q: FMP, sounds like something, kind of, in the bowels of the bureaucracy, but
                    sounds like, in a way, there was quite a bit of control there?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes, of course they had the money. If you have the money, a lot follows
                    behind that. People listen and pay attention if you say that you would like to
                    take a look at something. Then I did a project on the Country Program Plan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What are they?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>SERVICE: Those things every post has to do every year. I think they may have
                    stopped them now. But, for many years, you did them. You had to set out what
                    your priorities were, and how you would get there, what your objectives were. I
                    looked at all 180 of those. I looked at them by region to see how the objectives
                    varied from region to region. I put together various charts that showed how our
                    priorities differed among the regions. For example, fighting drugs was more
                    important in Latin America than it was in Europe. After I had finished that
                    project, I looked at senior performance pay because that was under attack and
                    they wanted to know what we should do about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Senior performance pay, you mean what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: I'm not sure we still have it, but starting with the new Foreign Service
                    Act there was provision for selecting the best performers each year and giving
                    them four, five, six thousand dollars, up to ten, as a bonus. Then, there were
                    presidential awards above that. The question was whether we should continue
                    this? How does it work? I looked at that, and compiled a list of who got them
                    over the years. It was actually pretty broad, much broader than people thought.
                    I think they felt that these awards were going to the same people, and that they
                    didn't need them anyway. That took me about six to eight months. Then Deputy
                    Director General, Peter Burleigh, suggested that I put my name up for running
                    the reinventing State Department project. I don't know whether you remember
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If you could explain what this is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: In March of 1993, Vice President Gore launched a reinventing government
                    initiative. I think this was, in part, a response to some of the Ross Perot
                    kinds of criticism of Washington. I think the idea was to make the government
                    more efficient, more effective, more customer friendly. Every department was
                    tasked with looking at itself and coming up with recommendations and
                    implementing them. In addition, there were central teams, made up of people
                    drawn from the various agencies, which were charged with looking at agencies
                    other than their own. Anyway, the State Department had a reinventing team, as
                    did every other agency. The first head of it was Bob Pearson, who was about to
                    go off to be DCM at USNATO. They urgently needed somebody to take over from him
                    in mid-stream, so to speak. The Under Secretary of Management, Dick Moose, asked
                    me to do it. I did that for the next year, but our report was finished by
                    September, 1993.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the principal areas where you thought you could
                        dsomething?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>SERVICE: It was about a 100-page book, by the time we got finished. There were
                    more than 100 recommendations. Anything was fair game. There were a lot of
                    recommendations about consular matters, a lot in the administrative area, and a
                    lot aimed at reducing unnecessary requirements, decentralizing to the greatest
                    extent possible, and reducing paperwork. This was completed and turned over to
                    management. Then Moose entrusted the implementation to an office that was
                    already established. I never joined that office, but I worked with them for the
                    next, eight, nine months. I took on two projects, in particular. One was
                    required reporting, in which I compiled what I'm sure was the most comprehensive
                    list the Department has ever had. It covered all areas of reporting,
                    substantive, administrative, financial, consular, etc. I made recommendations
                    about which ones we should try to eliminate. The list started off with some 400
                    reports, and by the time I finished my recommendations were that we keep about
                    200 or so. How many they were actually able to get rid of it, was another thing,
                    because some of them were congressionally mandated, and you had to go back to
                    Congress, which by and large they weren't willing to do.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find, in looking at this, that there had been a steady growth of
                    required reports to the Congress? There have been statements that Congress tries
                    to micromanage Foreign Affairs. How did you find this?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: I don't think I had a basis for chronological comparison, that there
                    were so many in year X and so many in year Y, but clearly these things added up
                    over time. Usually there was no mechanism for stopping the production of a
                    specific report once the reasons for asking for it no longer pertained. The
                    report would just continue indefinitely. Often when the Congress doesn't know
                    what else to do, or doesn't trust the State Department, it asks for a report.
                    Over time the burden becomes quite large.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After doing this, did you have anything else?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes, I also took on customer service. It was quite interesting. I got a
                    task force together from all the bureaus and we met periodically. The idea was
                    for each unit of the Department to figure out how it could become more
                    customer-friendly. Some parts of the Department had done a lot already. There
                    were some impressive approaches taken. We shared experiences and encouraged the
                    others to do the best they could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought the Consular Bureau and its offshoots
                        woulhave been the main people in the task force. Were there others?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>SERVICE: Sure, almost all activities of the Department, because customers are not
                    only on the outside, but also on the inside. I would argue that everybody has
                    customers. Part of our exercise was to figure out what we really did and who the
                    customers were. Political officers, economic officers, have customers. They deal
                    with outsiders, if only the Congress, or if only other bureaus and agencies. But
                    most also deal with outsiders from time to time. Now that I am retired and have
                    to deal with some of the departmental offices, I find it very frustrating at
                    times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were doing this from 1992 to 1994?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: That's right, and for the last year, I was basically doing my own thing.
                    I had various offices around the building. Every so often, they would tell me I
                    had to move. First I was on the third floor, then I was put on the first floor,
                    then I moved up to a suite where Strobe Talbott was, anywhere they could find a
                    spare office. I had a computer and a desk, and they would hook up my telephones.
                    I would do these projects. When I needed someone to deliver a report, I would do
                    it myself. I could get to all of my places of delivery within 40 minutes if I
                    followed the right path.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Of course, if you have 40 envelopes, you have to have them in the right
                    order to start with. You follow the shortest path. It was a very efficient
                    operation. I think we got a good bit done.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened in 1994?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: It was interesting. In about November of 1993, Dick Moose,
                    Undersecretary Moose, said they were going to nominate me for Ambassador to
                    Paraguay. Of course, I was very pleased with that. My name went over to the
                    White House. There was a little mention in Al Kamen's “The Loop.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In The Washington Post?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes, in The Washington Post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Assignment Gossip?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>SERVICE: Assignment Gossip - which said that a guy named Robert Service was going
                    to be nominated to become Ambassador to Paraguay. I think that was in January,
                    along with two other people, who were going to Latin America. I compared notes
                    with them. They said that they had already gotten their White House approval,
                    which I had not. That dragged on for about five or six months. My name sat over
                    at the White House because there was pressure to name a political appointee to
                    Paraguay. The White House hadn't made up its mind. I waited from about December
                    of 1993 to May, 1994, before the White House finally approved it. While I
                    waited, I continued to work on the various projects we've already discussed.
                    After the nomination was approved, I started taking two hours of Spanish twice a
                    week, anI worked on my calls and briefings, and getting ready to go to Paraguay.
                    I think I had pretty much stopped my projects by June, or July at the
                    latest.</p>

                <p>SERVICE: Do you know the answer?</p>

                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: The AFL-CIO had proposed somebody to go to Paraguay who had been long
                    active in the American Institute for Free Labor Development (AIFLD). He was
                    someone I knew fairly well because he had visited many of the posts where I had
                    served. He had devoted a good part of his adult life to strengthening U.S.-
                    Latin American labor relations. His name is Bill Dougherty. I think the State
                    Department's pitch, and here I'm talking mainly about Dick Moose and perhaps
                    Strobe Talbott, was that Dougherty probably wasn't the right person to send to
                    Paraguay, a country with very little organized labor, and that it would be
                    better to send him somewhere else, and send me to Paraguay. So Dougherty was
                    nominated for Guyana and I got the nod for Paraguay. But, then Bill couldn't get
                    a medical clearance for Guyana. I think he took the test twice and, so it ended
                    up that he did not go to Paraguay or Guyana. I did go to Paraguay.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: From November of 1994, until October of 1997.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>Q: Before you went to Paraguay, . . . I can't remember, . . . Had you had any
                    experience with the country and what were you getting from the desk and ARA
                    before you went out there about what was happening?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: I had been in Paraguay once before, when I was head of the Office
                    oSouthern Cone Affairs in the early 1980s. The Southern Cone included Argentina,
                    Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay. I was head of that in 1980 to 1982. I visited
                    Paraguay for a couple days. But, I also had served in Argentina and Chile and
                    Brazil twice. I was well acquainted with the neighborhood.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before you went out, what were American interests and
                        concerns iParaguay?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: First and foremost, democracy. If you recall, Alfredo Stroessner ran
                    Paraguay from 1954 until he was kicked out in 1989. They really never had had a
                    functioning democracy. Could it survive? Clearly, we wanted it to. Second, drugs
                    were a concern because a certain amount of cocaine comes out of the Andes,
                    through Paraguay, and on to Brazil, Argentina, Europe, and the U.S. Third,
                    intellectual property rights had long been a problem with respect to Paraguay
                    because it has been a place where dealing in contraband was more or less an
                    accepted way of life. Some of it was legal merchandise, legally imported into
                    Paraguay but maybe not legally exported out of Paraguay to the bigger and richer
                    neighbors. Perfumes, whiskey, cigarettes, all that sort of thing. But more
                    recently the trade had broadened to include other types of goods, particularly
                    electronics, software, CDs, cassettes, videos, computer games, etc. Sometimes
                    these were legitimate products. More often they were pirated reproductions. This
                    involved infringements on copyrights and patents. A lot of money was being lost
                    by American companies. Therefore it was a matter of concern to us. Environment
                    was also a concern. Paraguay has been busy chopping down its forests, and it has
                    two large rivers. How they are developed for navigation, irrigation and other
                    purposes could have major effects on the ecology of a large region in the center
                    of the continent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived there, what type of government did they
                        have?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>SERVICE: Let me go back a little bit. Stroessner was kicked out in 1989 by his
                    own military. His top generals said, “You've served your time. Goodbye.” He got
                    on a plane and went off to Brasilia where he still lives. The ranking general
                    after Stroessner was Andres Rodr�guez. Rodr�guez agreed to hold elections very
                    soon after the coup. He was the candidate of the party that had been in power
                    for 40 years, and he won. Nobody was quite sure whether this was really
                    democracy, or just one general substituting for another general. But, Rodr�guez
                    was convinced, or convinced himself, that he should step down after he had been
                    president for four years. He was succeeded by a civilian named Juan Carlos
                    Wasmosy. Wasmosy was elected in 1993. He had been office about a year and three
                    months when I got there. Democracy had in fact come about in Paraguay, although
                    it was still a rather weak plant, a young plant. Paraguay has long had two major
                    parties: the Liberals and the Colorados. The Colorados had governed the country
                    for 45 years, and they still do. Rodr�guez was a Colorado, Wasmosy was one,
                    Stroessner was one, obviously. But by the time I got there, and as a result of
                    the 1993 elections, the traditional opposition party, the Liberals, and a new
                    party called Encuentro Nacional had won a majority in Congress, and also the
                    mayorships in a number of the important cities, including Asunci�n. You did have
                    the opposition involved in exercising power.</p>

                <p>SERVICE: I think a considerable amount of progress was made. One of the things
                    that happened soon after I got there was reform of the Judicial Branch. It had
                    consisted previously of five Supreme Court Justices. The new constitution
                    expanded that number to nine. They had a rather elaborate selection procedure.
                    People nominated themselves, which was an interesting idea. Then a commission
                    looked at these nominations and came up with 27 recommended persons for nine
                    positions. Then the Congress selected the nine, which then had to be approved by
                    the President. The Supreme Court in its new form was made up of four people who
                    were viewed as members of the Colorado party, four who were members of the
                    opposition parties, and one who was considered an independent. That constituted
                    another important institutional brake on arbitrary power by one party or by one
                    individual. There was also reform of the electoral system, so that elections
                    would be as free as possible. Again, the people were chosen for thaCommission
                    were one Colorado, one Liberal, and one something else. In various ways the
                    monopoly power that had been held for so long by one party was breaking down.
                    There were other reforms, but a lot of things didn't get done also. There were
                    ambitious plans to rewrite numerous laws. Some of them had been around for
                    decades and were outdated. A great deal was left undone because of divisions
                    within the Colorado party. One thing that should be pointed out is that Wasmosy,
                    who was the President, and still is the President (1998), won in a very
                    contested primary to be the party candidate. In fact, he probably did not win,
                    and they stopped the ballot counting. Three months later, they declared he had
                    been the winner. So, the guy who probably won - a guy named Arga�a, pulled out
                    his supporters and basically there was bad blood and enmity between the Arga�a
                    faction of the party and the Wasmosy faction of the party for much of the time I
                    was Ambassador in Paraguay. And there was a third important player, whowas a
                    military man named General Lino Cesar Oviedo. He had been instrumental, one of
                    the key people, in the coup in 1989. Then, he had been moved up. He was a
                    Colonel at the time, and was promoted rapidly. When Wasmosy became President, he
                    made him head of the Army. Oviedo is a very charismatic person. He speaks
                    Guaran� fluently. That is the Indian language. He claims to be a man of the
                    people. He clearly had political ambitions. He was contesting power with Wasmosy
                    from the start of the Wasmosy administration. He claimed credit for having made
                    Wasmosy president. At the time of the contested primary, it was probably Oviedo
                    who said, “We are going to make sure that you win.” There was a lot of tension
                    between Wasmosy and Oviedo the whole time I was there.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>There was discussion at various times of what to do about it. Sometimes, the
                    President would discuss it with me. One time he said, “Well, I think I'll make
                    him head of the party.” He would suggest to the general that he retire and
                    become head of the party. I said, “Won't that ensure that he is the next
                    candidate for President?” The President said, “Not necessarily.” He may have
                    offered it, but Oviedo did not want the job. Oviedo gave us concern. We
                    believed, I still believe, that Oviedo was involved in the profits from drug
                    trafficking, if not drug trafficking itself. He certainly got some of his money
                    from contraband of various types, including pirated merchandise. He had
                    protective relationships with various border businessmen who looked to him to be
                    their man in the government, and to make sure that they got a good deal and were
                    not prosecuted or harassed in any way. I remember, one time, we had a trade
                    dispute with an American company in Chicago, named COBRA, because there was a
                    local company which was making their products. Actually, they were just
                    imitations of them. I mentioned this to Oviedo one day when I was visiting him
                    for some reason. He said, “Oh, yes, I had the two people in my office
                    yesterday.” It was a very surprising statement because why would this head of
                    the Army have these two people in his office. He had them in the office because
                    he was the one who was providing protection to the pirate. He was trying to work
                    out, I suppose, some sort of deal where the Americans would stop complaining and
                    yet his man wouldn't be harmed. Anyway, Oviedo was a constant source of concern
                    to most democrats in Paraguay, and to me as U.S. Ambassador, and to the U.S.
                    Government more generally. The crisis finally came in April of 1996. It was
                    rather unusual how the crisis developed. At the Embassy we had no particular
                    reason to think a crisis was imminent. We thought things were going along their
                    normal up and down course. We started getting calls from Washington about
                    possible unrest, possible coup attempts, this, that and the other thing. We
                    didn't know what to make of it. Finally, we figured out, by talking to people in
                    the Department, that some of Wasmosy's intermediaries had been going up and
                    talking to people in the White House or elsewhere and pushing these ideas.
                    Wasmosy and his staff had not been telling us, I'm not quite sure for what
                    reason. Anyway, we got that straightened out. There were a couple of meetings.
                    The Ambassador from here was down there with Wasmosy. Wasmosy said, “Look, we
                    are going to force Oviedo into retirement sometime in the next three, four
                    months. This country just isn't big enough for both of us. We are going to have
                    to move against him. This was in early April, 1996. I jotted that information
                    down and informed Washington. They had said similar things before and nothing
                    happened.</p>
                <p>My wife and I went off to visit the Mennonite community in the Chaco. We were
                    gone from Wednesday to Saturday. I got back in the early afternoon on Saturday.
                    This would have been the 20th of April. I received a call from the man who was
                    going to be the Foreign Minister later, but was still the private secretary to
                    the President. His name is Ruben Melgarejo. He said that he needed to see me. He
                    asked whether he could come over, and I said, “Certainly, come over at 5:00.” He
                    came over and we sat on the front veranda and started to talk. He said that the
                    President had decided that he was going to call Oviedo at 8:00 a.m. on Monday
                    morning, the 22nd of April, and tell him that he had to retire, he had to step
                    down. They weren't sure what would happen then. They would have to play it by
                    ear. Would the U.S. be supportive? I told Melgarejo that we would provide moral
                    support. I wasn't sure we could do much more than that.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>At about this point the DCM, Bill Harris, came up to the house. He saw us sitting
                    on the veranda. He sat with us. Then, he said, “I hear the telephone ringing.”
                    He went inside the house, and then he asked me to come. There had not really
                    been a phone call; he wanted to say something to me. He said, “Look, the word we
                    have through our military is that this person you're talking to is closely
                    linked to Conrado Pappalardo who, in turn, is a supporter of Oviedo. So he may
                    be trying to sound you out, maybe to mislead you, etc.” I replied “Well, I don't
                    think that is true, Bill. Besides we are too far into this to back out at this
                    point. I'm just going to ignore that piece of information.” We went back and
                    finished talking. That night, I went to the Brazilian Ambassador's house and
                    told him what was going to happen on Monday. He also had been aware that
                    something was afoot, but hadn't heard a firm time and day. Oviedo was there that
                    Saturday night also, although I didn't have occasion to speak to him. Others
                    also had some information. One elder statesman type urged the Brazilian
                    Ambassador and me to try to dissuade Wasmosy from confrontation. We decided to
                    ignore the plea. This was Saturday. On Sunday I got the key members of the
                    country team together and told them what I knew. The general attitude was “We'll
                    believe it when we see it.” On Monday morning, the 22nd, we were obviously on
                    tenterhooks. Was anything going to happen? And if so, what?</p>
                <p>We sat around most of the day waiting for a telephone call to tell us what was
                    happening. By early afternoon, there were rumors going around town that the
                    President and Oviedo, and other top military had met all morning. But nobody
                    knew what was going on. I called the President at least once, fairly early in
                    the day, to find out. He said, “No, nothing was conclusive yet. Don't say
                    anything, don't do anything.” I called him again, shortly after 6:00 in the
                    evening, and got pretty much the same response. This time, however, he sounded
                    less confident, less sure there would be a satisfactory outcome. After the
                    morning meeting, Oviedo had said he was going to the large cavalry base on the
                    edge of Asuncion to meet with the other Army generals. Oviedo also said he
                    wanted to talk to ex-president Rodr�guez who was in Buenos Aires. Wasmosy called
                    Rodr�guez's son-in-law, who sent a plane to get him.</p>
                <p>After I talked to the President a little after 6 p.m., I decided to release a
                    statement we had prepared earlier in the day. At about 6:25 the Public Affairs
                    officer, Mark Jacobs, called the most popular radio station and read our
                    statement directly on the air. It essentially said that the President had
                    ordered the head of the Army resign. He should do so. It was the first
                    “official” statement about what was going on. Although we did not realize it at
                    the time, it had the practical effect of making it impossible for the President
                    to back down. Up until then, he probably could have found an exit from the
                    crisis by returning to the status quo ante. Our release was the first official
                    statement. The Brazilians asked for a copy of what we had said and then put out
                    their own. The Argentines followed quickly.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>About the time we were putting out our statements, I called the Brazilian
                    Ambassador and asked if he wanted to come with me to talk to Oviedo. The
                    Brazilian suggested we also involve the Argentine Ambassador. So the three of us
                    set off in my car to try to talk to Oviedo and to explain to him the severe
                    repercussions for our relations if he did not obey President Wasmosy's orders.
                    On the way over, Nestor Ahuad, the Argentine, remarked that this might be the
                    last time anyone in Latin America had the opportunity to try to stop a military
                    coup. We laughed.But Oviedo would not see us. A soldier told us that he had
                    left, but he was not very convincing. We got back into the car and drove out to
                    the entrance where there was a lot of press and we had a press conference. We
                    told the press how concerned we were, etc. Then, we drove by the presidential
                    residence where Wasmosy was. He seemed fatalistic at that point. He didn't see
                    much more that he could do. The Argentine Ambassador, who was a medical doctor,
                    said that Wasmosy looked depressed. There were a lot of people milling around.
                    It wasn't clear to us that we could do anything more. So I went home and started
                    getting ready for bed.</p>
                <p>At about 10:30, I got a call from Papal Nuncio, at Wasmosy's residence, saying
                    that things were very bad, and that I should come back. I wasn't sure there was
                    anything useful that I could do. I asked whether I could talk to the President.
                    He got on the line, and said, “Yes, I would like you to come over.” By then, I
                    had sent my driver home. I got in my car and drove over there. It was just
                    across the street from my residence. In the President's house, there were about
                    200 people milling around — cabinet members, personal friends, congressmen and
                    senators, his sons, and perhaps a dozen ambassadors. The President was thinking
                    of resigning. Apparently, since late afternoon, various emissaries had been
                    going back and forth between Oviedo and Wasmosy. Oviedo was saying, “Look, if I
                    resign, you have to resign too. If not, I'm going to march on the palace.”
                    Wasmosy said over and over again that he did not want to be the cause of
                    bloodshed, and that he did not want to cause hardship for his country, etc. He
                    was seriously considering resigning. There were about 10 or 12 Ambassadors
                    there, most of them from Latin America. We all urged him not to resign. At one
                    point, he claimed the Liberal Party leader was in favor of his resigning. I said
                    that I didn't think that was so and asked whether he had talked with the Liberal
                    Party leader. He said, “No, this comes from his wife.” I said, “You've got to
                    talk to La�no himself. He's the head of the party.” So, Wasmosy put a call into
                    La�no and talked with him. La�no denied that he had urged resignation. But,
                    still Wasmosy was thinking of resigning.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>Finally, about midnight, I said, “Look, there is another alternative. Why don't
                    you send all these people home, get them out of harm's way, and you come over to
                    my house and spend the night?” It was no sooner said, than he and his three sons
                    were in a pickup truck. I got in after them, and we drove around a little bit,
                    not the most direct route, but around a couple blocks, into the Embassy
                    compound. I had to get out and identify myself because it was a truck that was
                    not an Embassy truck. We got in and went up to my office. The first thing I did
                    was to call the Department and say “I've got the President here. What should I
                    do?” I think I got somebody in the watch office. They said, “Hold on, we'll get
                    back to you.” I think they finally got hold of Peter Tarnoff, Under Secretary
                    for Political Affairs. The word came back that it was ok for the president to be
                    there. Of course, there was no real alternative at that moment. But I was a bit
                    concerned. A day or two earlier, talking with someone in ARA, that official had
                    expressed the hope that if Wasmosy had to take refuge in an embassy it would not
                    be ours. And the next morning, to get ahead of my story, I asked the
                    administrative officer to check what had to be done to get Wasmosy out of our
                    compound and into that of the Papal Nuncio, who had a house right next door but
                    separated by high walls. Luckily it never came to that.</p>
                <p>I got a call from the head of one of the opposition parties, Guillermo Caballero
                    Vargas, who asked me whether somebody important was there. I said, “Yes.” Then,
                    I got a call from the Brazilian Ambassador who also asked me whether somebody
                    was there. When I answered with an affirmative, he asked whether he could come
                    over. I said, “Sure.” His name, by the way, is Marcio Dias D'Oliveira. We were
                    good friends, and more important, our governments shared the same views
                    regarding the desirability of democracy in Paraguay. So he came over.</p>
                <p>There we were: The President and three of his sons, the Brazilian, various of the
                    Embassy officers, and one of the emissaries that had been shuttling back and for
                    to where Oviedo was. The President was still thinking of resigning, even when he
                    got over to the Embassy. The Brazilian Ambassador, playing for time, suggested
                    he ask instead for a leave of absence, and helped him to draft such a request.
                    The Brazilian and the emissary took that piece of paper and went to Oviedo's
                    place. About this time Jeff Davidow called. Jeff was the incoming Assistant
                    Secretary for Latin American Affairs. He also talked to Wasmosy and said, “Don't
                    resign.” About 1:00 or 1:30, we went up to my residence, further up the
                    compound. We sat around up there for two or three hours. At about 3:00 a.m. OAS
                    Secretary General Gaviria called. He was in Bolivia. He, even more emphatically,
                    told Wasmosy not to resign.</p>
                <p>Q: Let me just ask a question here. The whole point of the matter was that the
                    democracy was fragile and the idea of a President resigning under the threat of
                    the military, would just negate what had been happening all over Latin America.
                    So, it was a very important point at this time?</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes, very much so, given the history of Paraguay and the historically
                    dominant role of the military. We wanted to preserve democratic order and
                    democratic constitutional order, etc. So, Gaviria called and urged him not to.
                    Then, the emissary and the Brazilian Ambassador came back from Oviedo and said
                    that Oviedo had rejected the leave of absence idea. He said that he wanted a
                    letter of resignation. He even had the text. It was the one that Stroessner was
                    forced to sign in 1989. At that point, Wasmosy said, “I'm not going down that
                    path.” He had firmed up in his own mind that that was not the proper, the best
                    thing to do. Then, he went to bed for an hour. We all went to bed for an
                    hour.</p>
                <p>At 6:30 am, this is Tuesday now, April 23, he and his sons got up. We had a
                    little breakfast. The President was still not clear on what he was going to do
                    next. At one point he looked out the window at the beautiful grounds and said he
                    might just spend the day there. I urged him to get hold of his closest advisors,
                    have them come over, and think about what had to be done. He got a couple of
                    them in: Melgarejo, his private secretary and the one who had talked to me on
                    Saturday afternoon, and Morales, who had been a colleague in grade school. They
                    decided the President needed to get back into a normal routine of activities. We
                    all went back to the Presidential palace. He changed clothes and shaved. Then we
                    all went down in a caravan of cars and pickups to the Palace downtown. There
                    were a lot of people in the streets, clapping and honking. It was an emotional
                    boost for Wasmosy. Most of the Paraguayan vehicles were black. My own white
                    Caprice was at the back of the caravan. We stayed at the palace all morning.
                    There were four Ambassadors, myself plus the three representing the other
                    countries of Mercosur: Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Argentina?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes. Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay. The Spaniard was in from time to time.
                    On the other side of the President's desk you had the President's chief
                    advisors. Wasmosy was at his desk. The chief advisors were over here, and the
                    Ambassadors here. The basic issue for the morning was what to do about Oviedo.
                    Most thought that he had essentially given up, but still it was necessary to
                    provide him a graceful exit, some face-saving way out. The idea developed to
                    make him Minister of Defense. I think I was the one who initially raised that
                    possibility, more in the way of a question than a proposal. Eventually, it was
                    picked up by others in the room, even though I had not pursued it, and was far
                    from sure in my own mind that it made sense. Now, Minister of Defense is not as
                    important a job in Paraguay as it is here. It is not in the chain of command. So
                    the proposal was conveyed to Oviedo. He accepted immediately. Wasmosy announced
                    the “solution” to Gaviria when he arrived from Bolivia shortly after noon, and
                    then later to the Foreign Ministers or Deputy Foreign Ministers of Argentina,
                    Brazil, and Uruguay when they arrived later in the day. There was also a lunch,
                    at which the leaders of the opposition parties were present. Nobody said what a
                    terrible idea this was right at that moment. They sort of said, “Well, it would
                    have been better to make him Ambassador to Germany, or something. But, if that
                    is the way it is, that's the way it is. At least the coup threat is over, and
                    constitutional order has been preserved.”By late afternoon, however, all sorts
                    of opposition had begun to be heard against the idea of rewarding someone who
                    had almost staged a coup. There had been no thought given to public opinion when
                    a graceful exit for Oviedo was being decided. Public opinion is a rather new
                    phenomenon in Paraguay. But now it was making itself heard. Many people, and not
                    just those who belonged to opposition parties, were asking how it was possible
                    that this man who has just threatened a coup, had all but staged one, had tried
                    to force a change in government, was now being rewarded. This was still
                    Tuesday.</p>
                <p>They held the ceremony for Oviedo to resign on Wednesday. It was a gala event
                    with all the pomp that could be mustered on short notice. Oviedo and Wasmosy
                    embraced. Afterward, Mrs. Oviedo confronted Wasmosy and told him that her
                    husband had done his part. Now it was the President's turn to do his and carry
                    through with his promise to make Oviedo the Defense Minister.</p>
                <p>The idea was to name him the Minister of Defense on Thursday. But, between
                    Tuesday afternoon and evening, and Thursday morning, the opposition to doing
                    that had become very strong and very vocal. Wasmosy decided no, he could not do
                    it. There was a very interesting meeting on Thursday morning at the Presidential
                    residence, which the Brazilian and I were both at. After Wasmosy had made the
                    decision not to make Oviedo Minister of Defense, he had to draft a speech to
                    explain his decision. He was sort of thinking out loud. He had the head of the
                    Armed Forces, General Nogueira, sitting beside him: “ I have decided, with
                    support of the Armed Forces, etc. Nogueira stopped him and said, “No, Mr.
                    President, don't put that in. This country, too long, has made things rely on
                    the Armed Forces. Don't say “with the support of the Armed Forces.” Just say, in
                    accord with my constitutional authority, have decided not to name Oviedo Defense
                    Minister.” In a country with Paraguay's record of military involvement in
                    politics, that was a very important moment.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>Q: What happened to Oviedo?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: Now, we get into the ironies of the matter. Oviedo, who was retired on
                    the 24th of April, and thought he was going to become Minister of Defense on the
                    25th, was left out in the cold. He was not allowed to make a speech at the
                    National Presidential Palace. They cut the lines to the microphone when he tried
                    to speak. He became a full time politician. He spent the next year stumping the
                    country, holding meetings, giving away things, and promising more. He won the
                    Colorado Party primary for the presidency in September, 1997. There appeared to
                    be a good chance that he would succeed Wasmosy as president. However, there were
                    a number of court cases pending against him because of what he had tried to do
                    in April, 1996. Finally, a military court convicted him and sentenced him to 10
                    years for having attempted the coup in 1996. This was upheld by the Supreme
                    Court shortly before the Presidential election, which was on May 10, 1998. Being
                    a convicted prisoner, he could not be on the ballot. Therefore, the man who had
                    run with him as Vice President moved up to the presidential slot. The person who
                    had lost, who had come in second, Arg�na, who had also been beaten in the
                    Colorado primary by Wasmosy in 1992, became the vice presidential candidate.
                    Oviedo is in jail, in a military prison. His Vice President, Cubas, has been
                    elected President. He has declared that as soon as he is President, he will look
                    for a way to free Oviedo. We will have to see whether that happens or not.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, going back to this whole thing. In the first place, very early on, the
                    President is sitting down there with you and asking whether he should do this or
                    what you would suggest he do. It sounds like the sort of thing, . . . in Latin
                    America society, which I don't know, but a political thing would be a tendency
                    to keep somewhat away from the American Ambassador.</p>
                <p>SERVICE: In many countries where I have served, that is true, or was true, much
                    more in the past than it is now. Paraguay is unusual in the sense that, to my
                    knowledge, there has never been a strong anti-American movement. In fact, quite
                    the reverse, because they have big neighbors who are much closer to them,
                    Argentina and Brazil. They have looked to the U.S. to be the balance at times
                    against those neighbors. It's been true, in fact, . . . Rutherford B. Hayes is a
                    famous person in Paraguay, because after the war of the Triple Alliance, when
                    Paraguay lost to Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay, and had chunks of its territory
                    taken away by them, one final piece was desired by Argentina. It was put up to
                    arbitration and Rutherford B. Hayes was the arbitrator. Hayes came down on the
                    side of Paraguay. So, he has a department and a town named after him. We were
                    also involved in helping to settle the Chaco War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was in the 1930s?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes. By and large, the U.S. has a good reputation there. We put a great
                    deal of money into the country in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s under AID and its
                    predecessors. We have had a Peace Corps program there for a long time. It is the
                    largest Peace Corps program in the world. Americans are liked. I don't think
                    there was much political downside for Wasmosy from consulting with the U.S.
                    Embassy. The leftists would be against it of course, but there aren't that many
                    leftists in Paraguay. And the more nationalistic right didn't approve. But, as I
                    say, not many people.</p>
                <p>Q: Of course, I assume that what was happening was occurring at a point in time,
                    that by this time, all of Latin America had gotten rid of its dictatorships,
                    hadn't it?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: All except for Cuba.</p>
                <p>Q: All except for Cuba, which was always, sort of, off to one side. Paraguay had
                    the weight of all these countries around it. They didn't want to see any
                    countries go back to old ways. I would think that would be a pressure.</p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes, I think there was. There was, in fact, a great outpouring of
                    support from all of the Latin neighbors. Many of the Presidents called Wasmosy.
                    So did President Clinton on the afternoon of April 23.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “Hang in there.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about public opinion? Was that a factor that he could
                        calupon early on or did he feel he couldn't?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: I don't think they were much aware of public opinion. The whole naming
                    of Oviedo as Minister of Defense episode, demonstrated to me that public opinion
                    was not taken into account, normally. Nobody asked what would be the reaction to
                    naming him Minister of Defense. In the future, because of what happened, more
                    attention will be given to public opinion.</p>
                <p>Q: The normal thing, you would think would be, the President would get up and
                    make a speech . . . “My people” . . ., something like that. In your talks with
                    others, that wasn't a consideration?</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>SERVICE: He did do that eventually. There was not one before he decided to fire
                    Oviedo, but he did make speeches on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and he did
                    rally support to his actions. Oviedo at that point was quite low in popularity
                    polls. But, he devoted a great deal of effort to his campaign, and as I said
                    earlier he was somewhat charismatic.</p>
                <p>Q: What about the military forces? Had he sent them to march over to the
                    presidential palace, would they have marched, or what was the feeling?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: Nobody knows. I think he had some officers who were personally loyal to
                    him. I'm not sure the majority would have been loyal if a coup had been
                    attempted. There is a very strong tradition in the military, any military, that
                    you do what the guy above you tells you to do. Oviedo was head of the Army at
                    that point. So, it was not impossible that he could have succeeded. There is an
                    anecdote and I don't know whether it is true. Finally, about 5:00 in the morning
                    on Tuesday, after this long night of indecision and back and forth — was Wasmosy
                    going to resign, or wasn't he going to resign — Oviedo realized he was not. He
                    said to the military men around him, “Well, we'll have to crank up the tanks.”
                    One of the generals said, “You know, we don't have a plan and it is almost
                    daylight. We've lost the advantage of night time. It's impractical.” That
                    suggests that at least that general's heart was not in the operation. Probably
                    Oviedo never intended to use force. He thought he could win by bluffing and by
                    bluster, which is the way he had gotten most of what he wanted in the past. This
                    time Wasmosy held out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much press coverage at all on this at the
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: A tremendous amount locally. But, internationally, it was not a big
                    deal. In fact, Strobe Talbott complained to me when I came back that he had a
                    hard time getting any newsmen interested in the story. He gave a couple of
                    interviews to The Washington Post and others. The Washington Post reporter, who
                    was based in Buenos Aires, came up and I gave him a long interview, which
                    appeared in the paper. There were a few others, but not a great deal. Paraguay
                    was off the screen for most Americans.</p>
                <p>Q: Not many American Ambassadors have a chance to be there to handhold and to
                    support a President who is threatened by the military take over, and all.</p>
                <p>SERVICE: Oh, no, it was an incredible experience, unique. Obviously, this was the
                    high point of my career. It turned out okay. But for a while I doubted it would
                    end well. I told the DCM, Bill Harris, “Look, you may be in charge for a long
                    time.” But, it then turned around, and came out okay, at least then. Now,
                    whether okay also includes what has happened in the subsequent two years, and
                    the fact that Oviedo became the official candidate, until he was disqualified, .
                    . . I don't know. It doesn't seem as neat as it seemed in 1996.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Turning to some of the other things that you had to deal
                        with -drugs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Drugs were a continual issue, a headache, problem. It was the question I
                    was asked most frequently whenever I saw the press, which was very frequently.
                    If I went to a government office, there would usually be some press when I left.
                    If not initially, then very quickly, they would ask about the drug effort and
                    whether the U.S. believed that Paraguay had made an adequate effort.</p>
                <p>Just to give you some background, we have a process called certification by which
                    our President has to certify each year that Paraguay is cooperating fully in the
                    battle against drugs. Paraguay is included on the list of major drug producing
                    or trafficking countries. Paraguay was always certified until I went as
                    Ambassador. Then, the first time it came up while I was Ambassador, which would
                    have been March 1st of 1995, Paraguay was certified only on the basis of the
                    national interest waiver. There are basically three categories: you can be fully
                    certified or you can be “not certified,” or you can be certified on the basis of
                    a national interest waiver, which means that you wouldn't have been certified
                    except that it is in our interest to do so. Paraguay was in this grey area,
                    along with the three major producers: Peru, Bolivia, and Colombia. This made
                    Wasmosy very unhappy. The press focused on it a good bit. We tried to motivate
                    them to do what was necessary to restore full certification. It was a hard job
                    for various reasons: (1) Because some people in government profited from the
                    drug trade, if not in the national government, which I can't totally rule out,
                    then at least at the local and regional levels. I've mentioned Oviedo as a
                    person whom I think indirectly profited from the drug trade. Governors in the
                    border areas also undoubtedly received money from it. There was a vested
                    interest in maintaining it. And (2), the Paraguayans have practically no history
                    of a capable investigative force able to find out who is doing what.
                    Historically, there has been very little interest in that kind of capability
                    because it might point fingers at the wrong people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also, they are sort of like Andorra (a smuggling
                        state).</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>SERVICE: A smuggling state, certainly. So, there has been a lot of live and let
                    live and don't ask too many questions and maybe some of the money this guy is
                    making will come to you, etc. Also, I would say, because of its history as a
                    smuggling state, if we may call it that, there is very weak law enforcement,
                    very little tradition of being willing to stop a bullet. They had very little
                    experience in trying to uphold the law, and fighting corruption. Nobody wanted
                    to go out there and get his head blown off. There was not much tradition of
                    wanting to do that. It was hard to get them to do what was needed. There is
                    another factor which in all fairness should be mentioned. Paraguay is no worse
                    than a lot of Latin America countries. Each year, when it came to certification
                    time, you had to have somebody on the list. We have much more extensive and
                    important relations with larger countries, Mexico for example. So, what do you
                    do? You end up with Paraguay, and maybe Belize, and maybe Panama, occasionally,
                    countries for which there are not many defenders in Washington who would say
                    that you can't do that because we have other important interests with them. I
                    think Paraguay suffered on that account as well. Anyway, the first year they
                    were certified only on the basis of national interest, the second year, the
                    same. The third year, they were fully certified. But, then the fourth year,
                    after I've left, they were put back in the national interest waiver category.
                    So, have they learned anything, have they done much? I don't know. We were quite
                    hopeful at one point after Oviedo had been fired. They put a man named Ayala, an
                    ex-general, in charge of the drug program. He had been an opponent of Oviedo,
                    supposedly because he was honest and Oviedo wasn't. That hasn't produced the
                    results we hoped for either. I don't know if they are going to make much
                    progress, or how soon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they essentially getting their raw product through
                        Bolivia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes, most of it comes down from Bolivia in planeloads of 100 or 200
                    kilos, or by truck or bus, down through the Chaco. Most of it moves onto
                    Argentina, Brazil, the markets there, or onto Europe or some to the U.S. But, I
                    don't think much goes to the U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about intellectual property?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>SERVICE: Again, same sort of problem as drugs, in a way. There were a lot of
                    people making money off of it. There were a lot of people being bought off. The
                    Chinese had been very active in some of it. Some of the pirated merchandise was
                    from Taiwan, some of it from Hong Kong, some, maybe, from the mainland. But,
                    there is a lot of money in it. It is hard to control, thus far. Judges tend to
                    look the other way. We had one case in which the representative of a U.S.
                    company, which was being plagiarized, or pirated, came down. The person from the
                    U.S., the representative in Paraguay, and our economic officer went over there
                    to Ciudad del Este, the center of such activities. They went to the factories
                    where these pirate activities were taking place. I forget whether it was CDs or
                    musical tapes, or software. The local judge went with them. The judge closed it
                    down, embargoed, put tape on everything. One of the workers appealed on the
                    basis that he was being deprived of his livelihood, and some other judge ordered
                    the factory reopened. There were a lot of games like that going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the things essentially being manufactured there or
                        was thijust a way for things to come in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: A lot of the parts came from Taiwan or elsewhere in Asia and were
                    assembled there. But, also, some reproduction, or production took place in
                    Paraguay. They may be getting to where they can actually do most of it
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any criminal sanctions of some sort from the
                        United States if the country didn't do something about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: We are possibly moving toward that now. Paraguay, since I left, has been
                    declared a priority country, which means that within six months, USTR [United
                    States Trade Representative] has to come up with a game plan which may mean
                    sanctions against something they export to us. The problem with Paraguay is that
                    they don't export very much to us. We export much more to Paraguay than they do
                    to us. Their exports to us are only about fifty million dollars a year, some
                    wood products of which the main exporter is an American citizen, who has a
                    factory near Ciudad del Este. Sugar is also exported, but not much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the environment?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>SERVICE: The big issue there was what is called the Hidrov�a. This is a plan to
                    make the Parana and Paraguay Rivers navigable for 2,500 miles, up into the
                    center of Brazil, or further. The environmentalists are very concerned that this
                    could cause irreparable damage to the Pantanal, which is a huge marshland area
                    in the center of the continent, a tremendous natural resource. If they don't do
                    anything to harm the Pantanal, cleaning up the river, or blowing up a few rocks
                    is fine, but what the environmentalists don't want to see done is eliminating
                    the huge curves in the Paraguay River. They don't want anything done that would
                    damage the Pantanal. That may mean instead of having year-round clearance of 10
                    feet, you have to settle for 8.5 or nine feet. That practically exists now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we take any part in that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: We kept pressing them no to do anything that they would regret later. In
                    fact, we invited and got President Wasmosy to come up and visit the Everglades
                    and the Mississippi River to see some of the things that we were spending
                    billions of dollars to undo.</p>
                <p>Q: I take it that you were able to leave in 1997 at least with the feeling that
                    you were able to hold a dike against return to military rule?</p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes, I think so. I think we helped. In a new democracy, every time you
                    are able to overcome some obstacle/hurdle or sustain something which is being
                    threatened, it makes it a little bit stronger. That is the feeling I and others
                    had about our time in Paraguay. We had contributed to this process of
                    stabilization, of their getting accustomed to how democracy is supposed to work.
                    Paraguay still has a long way to go, but each success is one more step in that
                    process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1997, did you retire?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes, I came back to the Department and retired in November,1997.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What are you pointed toward now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: I'm not sure. I was doing a little consulting for a while for a company
                    which thought that there was a good market for its product in Paraguay. My main
                    accomplishment was to convince them that there is not that good a market there
                    right now. So, I am no longer working for them. I may do some more consulting.
                    There are a lot of other things out there. I'm just going to see what comes
                    along. You have to keep active in something.</p>
