                <p>AMBASSADOR OTTO J. REICH</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: August 30, 1991</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is August 30, 1991. This is an interview with
                        Ambassador Otto Reich being done on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic
                        Studies and I am Charles Stuart Kennedy. Mr. Ambassador, I wonder if you
                        could give me a little about your background—where you came from, your
                        education, etc.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: I was born in Cuba. I am a refugee. My father was also a refugee from
                    Austria. When the Nazis invaded in 1938 he came out by way of Switzerland,
                    France, the French Foreign Legion in North Africa. When the French surrendered
                    he left on a Portuguese freighter and ended up in Cuba in 1942. He was very
                    happy there until Castro came when we had to do the whole thing over again, this
                    time with a family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When were you born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: 1945.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you left in 1960?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: Right and settled in New York for a few months. Didn't care for it and
                    moved to North Carolina. I went to school at Chapel Hill and graduated in 1966
                    with a degree in international studies, with concentration on Latin America. I
                    then joined the army and was sent to the US Canal Zone where I spent two years.
                    I decided at that time that I wanted a little bit more academic training and
                    applied to a number of schools and was accepted at Georgetown. I got a Masters
                    in Latin American studies there with concentration on economic development. Then
                    I went into business and government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Coming from your background, you must have had sort of two
                        themes going through—one, the Austrian and the other the Cuban. Did one
                        predominate?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>REICH: Yes. You would have to say that the Cuban predominated because...well, my
                    mother was Cuban and all my living relatives were Cuban. My father was Jewish.
                    Almost all of his relatives were killed by the Nazis. My father survived because
                    he literally walked over the Alps in August, 1938 and escaped. But I was raised
                    in a Cuban family, Cuban household. The only foreigner was my father and he was
                    very adaptable. He had adapted very well. Of course he was very proud of his
                    Austrian background and reminded me a lot of the character in “The Sound of
                    Music” — Captain von Trapp. He was an Austrian nationalist but very anti-Nazi
                    and anti-Fascist. He was also anti-communist because he saw it as only another
                    strain of Fascism. But in terms of the ethnic culture I was much more Cuban
                    rather than Austrian. But as I came to the States at a relatively early age, 14,
                    I was able to adapt very quickly. I guess coming from a long line of refugees
                    you tend to adapt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you come from within the society of Cuba?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: Well, my father arrived literally penniless so we were not wealthy by any
                    means. But he was very hard-working and built up a business. First he got $10
                    from the Austrian Refugee Committee. This was right after the United States
                    entered the war in 1942. The western hemisphere was just beginning to enter into
                    the war, but there already was a committee set up to assist the people who had
                    been trying to leave Europe. He got into the diamond cutting business and made a
                    little money then. He tried a couple of businesses and ended up as a partner in
                    a firm that imported Formica from the United States and made Formica furniture.
                    I would put us very much in the middle class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Entrepreneurial middle class.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came to the United States, how did you fit in?
                        Were you part of a Cuban refugee group?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>REICH: No, not at all. And I credit my parents for this. My brother and I were
                    very young, he was even younger (11 years), and wanted to go to Miami with all
                    the other Cubans, which is understandable as you want to go where you are the
                    most comfortable. My father decided that there were already enough Cuban
                    refugees in Miami. If he was going to do the best he could for his family, he
                    was going to have to go some place else. We moved to New York. He tried a number
                    of different jobs there...literally selling Fuller brushes and Hoover vacuum
                    cleaners door to door. Then he got a job offer from North Carolina, from another
                    Austrian refugee who had settled in Cuba and known him. We were very happy
                    there, in Charlotte, North Carolina. My father took a number of jobs there, the
                    first one didn't work out. He ended up establishing a sales company selling
                    electronic equipment, radios, record players, etc. He was a salesman all his
                    life. He loved to sell, loved to talk to people.</p>
                <p>So that is how I ended up in North Carolina, where I went to high school and then
                    on to college. I decided, and this might be one of your next questions...How did
                    I get into something that led to being an ambassador?...I was always interested
                    in politics because my life had been affected by politics, by international
                    upheavals. As soon as I was old enough to ask questions I wanted to know how and
                    why my father ended up in Cuba. Why was there a Second World War? Why did my
                    grandparents get killed by people called Nazis and who were these people? So I
                    started studying history and politics and political science and also economics.
                    I liked economics. I always felt that underlying a lot of this history was
                    economic injustice. Those were the two areas I concentrated on—politics and
                    economics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any impression while you were in the military
                        in the Panama Canal Zone about the comparison and contrast of the Americans
                        and the Panamanians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: Yes, of course. You couldn't help it. I, by the way, joined the army
                    because I felt, and I do not think this is a unique feeling among refugees, that
                    this country had been very generous in simply just opening its doors. I probably
                    would have been killed if I remained in Cuba, because I was raised in an
                    anti-Fascist family and was opposing the government, as we had opposed the
                    government of Batista before that. But there was a real difference there. — and
                    here I agree completely with Jeane Kirkpatrick — there is a difference between
                    authoritarian and totalitarian regimes, and I have lived under both. Batista,
                    the authoritarian, left you alone unless you opposed him. Castro, the
                    totalitarian, didn't leave you alone unless you supported him. I would have
                    definitely been in real trouble.</p>
                <p>So, I joined the army because I felt I owed the United States that and a lot
                    more.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>I was very fortunate to be sent to Panama. I asked to be sent to Panama because
                    of the language. I didn't want to be sent to Alaska or some place where anyone
                    else could have taken my place. I would have gone to Vietnam if I had been
                    assigned, this was 1966-67, but fortunately I didn't go. I wasn't particularly
                    anxious to go to Vietnam, not that I didn't think we were doing the right thing,
                    but I thought I could contribute more in a place where I could use my language
                    and knowledge of the society.</p>
                <p>When I got to Panama I was put in a job that the army called Civil Affairs, which
                    is political/military relations, dealing with the people. It was extremely
                    interesting because our unit was very specialized and dealt with both grassroots
                    development, with the very poorest people in the country, as well as the top
                    policy-makers. For example, I met people like Omar Torrijos who at that time was
                    a major. I met him before he launched his coup. One of my jobs, because of my
                    Spanish, was of liaison with the then-called Panama National Guard, later called
                    the Panama Defense Forces and now called the Public Order Forces.</p>
                <p>The job was extremely interesting but did put me in contact with people who had
                    literally nothing. For example, one project that I remember was with a number of
                    very poor Panamanian peasants who had settled within the artillery impact range.
                    The Panama Canal Zone was 500 square miles, a lot of territory, and we have
                    jungle schools and a number of things there where the US Army practices tropic
                    survival, maneuvers, etc. One of those activities was learning to fire in tropic
                    conditions and there was an artillery impact range which seemed to some peasants
                    walking around looking for land to plant, like a very nice place. But, of
                    course, it was also very dangerous. So these people squatted in that land.</p>
                <p>My unit had to go to work with the families and the civil authorities not only to
                    move them out...we didn't want to just evict them, we could have opened the gate
                    and thrown them out, but we don't do that. What we did was to work with the
                    Panamanians to find them some land, help them build houses. We didn't build
                    houses for them, we supplied technical assistance and materials. We very much
                    believed that they had to build the houses themselves if they were to have any
                    pride in them. We found in the process that these people were totally ignorant
                    and in very poor health...there was 100 percent anemia as well as intestinal
                    worms among the children. So we brought in doctors for the people, and vets to
                    treat their animals, Public Health people to help them dig sewers, build a water
                    supply system and things like that.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>That was one of the things that led me to go and get a Masters degree in economic
                    development. I figured that this wasn't the way things should be, but at the
                    same time I tried to keep the big picture, because you can get traumatized,
                    which I think happened later to many of our Peace Corps volunteers. Those who
                    had come from wealthy to upper middle class backgrounds and would go to Africa
                    or Latin America, to a little village, and encounter the same conditions that I
                    have just described. They would be traumatized and say that this was a terrible
                    injustice, and it is, but they would blame the wrong causes, in my opinion. I
                    always felt that the way to deal with the issue of economic development, social
                    justice, etc. was through more freedom and not collectivization and the
                    communist system which today we see falling apart, fortunately. Free enterprise,
                    individual initiative, with the involvement, of course, of the state. You can't
                    leave the government out. We, in fact, were a state. We provided hammers, boards
                    and nails to those peasants. Without them they wouldn't have had a house. But
                    without their own individual initiative they wouldn't have worked either. So
                    that is a little aside.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You got your Masters degree and then what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: I got my Masters at Georgetown in economic development.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: I started at Georgetown in January, 1970 having been discharged from the
                    army in November, 1969 after three and a half years. I finished my Masters in
                    1973. While I was here I did a couple of very useful things. I took advantage of
                    the fact that Georgetown geographic location.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the way for the record this interview is taking place
                        at Georgetown University.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: I got a job on the Hill, the lowest level staff worker you can be in a
                    congressional office, what they call a case worker. I was given additional
                    responsibilities later on as they felt they could give them to me. That was a
                    very interesting experience because that also taught me not only how the
                    Congress works, but a lot about the American people and their elected
                    representatives, and how the executive branch works because I had to work with
                    people in the executive branch to try to solve problems for constituents of the
                    congressman I worked for.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which congressman?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: His name was W.R. “Bill” Hull, from Missouri, the 6th district. He is now
                    deceased. He was elderly even then, back in the early '70s. I did a few other
                    political things.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>I then considered myself a member of the Democratic Party. I have since gone
                    through a long process of self-criticism, as the Marxists would call it, and
                    came to the conclusion that I was not a Democrat and subsequently, by the
                    late-70s, became active in Republican Party politics.</p>

                        active?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: Well, in early '70s, as I said, I was in Georgetown, in graduate school,
                    and that took the first three years. In 1972, through some friends of mine in
                    the Democratic Party, I got a two-month job working for the Party during the
                    campaign of Senator George McGovern. That contributed, frankly, to my
                    disillusionment with the Democratic Party and with politics. I decided that I
                    needed to leave Washington for a while.</p>
                <p>So I moved to Miami to join my former army roommate while in the Canal Zone who
                    had opened up a business in Miami, importing seafood from Latin America. He
                    thought there was a need for an export side of the business. I went down and
                    started doing the export side of that company but we ran into financial
                    difficulties because he had bought a large quantity of seafood at a time when
                    the price was very high and the price dropped. So we learned very tough lessons
                    about supply and demand, prices, and the free market system. I believe in it
                    very much, but we weren't very good at it at that particular level of business.
                    I spent over a year working there and it was the equivalent, in my opinion, of
                    getting a Masters degree in business administration, but studying the wrong
                    cases. I learned what not to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is the best way to learn.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: Well, I suppose, yes. I certainly am not going to repeat those mistakes.
                    But it was very, very interesting.</p>
                <p>While there I met a lot of people in Florida in import and export, etc. The State
                    of Florida Department of Commerce offered me a job while I was still working for
                    the seafood company. I decided that it would be interesting. I was promoting
                    Florida trade and industry all over Latin America. I traveled around Latin
                    America, which was fun. I was single so I didn't have to worry about being away
                    from my family. I put on export seminars and trade shows for Florida and tried
                    to attract investment to Florida. This was 1975.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>The City of Miami then started an economic development program through some grant
                    block money they got from the Federal Government. They set up an economic
                    development office and I was hired to be the economic development coordinator
                    for the city, to do the same international promotion but also added domestic
                    economic development work.Only a few months after I was in that job I got a call
                    from the Council of the Americas, the Washington office of the Council, with
                    which I had contact while in graduate school. The Council of the Americas is a
                    non-profit trade association of about 200 US corporations that represent most of
                    US investment in Latin America—big companies. They were looking for a deputy
                    director for the Washington office. I turned it down then because I had recently
                    started the City of Miami job.</p>
                <p>By then I had gotten married and told my wife about this call, and after talking
                    with her I realized that I had gotten away from my academic field of Latin
                    America and economic development. I had gone into business, worked in trade
                    promotion and was getting into domestic, urban, economic development work. That
                    was very interesting and very important, but really not my field. So I called
                    the Council back the next day and asked for a little more information.To make a
                    long story short, they offered me the job, and in 1976 I moved back to
                    Washington. A year later the man who was head of the office left, and I was made
                    the head of the Washington office of the Council which is based in New York, and
                    is pretty prestigious. It was founded by David Rockefeller back at the time of
                    the Alliance for Progress. I was responsible for executive branch relations,
                    lobbying and all Washington activities, I made a lot of contacts at the
                    time.</p>
                <p>The Carter Administration then came in and I started getting quite concerned
                    about our foreign policy, particularly in Latin America. I didn't think the
                    Carter Administration was competent. I saw what was happening to the United
                    States around the world, as well as domestically. That accelerated my desire to
                    become active in Republican Party politics, at least do something to change the
                    direction of the country. Through some friends, I joined the Bush campaign as a
                    volunteer. I thought George Bush, of all the Republican candidates at the time,
                    was the best qualified. When Ronald Reagan defeated Bush in the primaries, in
                    1980, I had been working with Bush for about six months, the Reagan people
                    reached out to most of the Bush people...you'll recall Jim Baker, Bush's
                    manager, was asked to join even before Bush was picked as Vice Presidential
                    candidate...and lower echelon people like myself were asked if we wanted to
                    contribute to the Reagan campaign. I said I would. Then Reagan was elected and
                    several months after that I was offered the job as Assistant Administrator of
                    AID for Latin America and the Caribbean. This really was up my alley. It was
                    what I studied, what I got my Masters degree in.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we get to that I would like to ask you a question
                        about the Council of the Americas. You know in the academic world, and I am
                        sure you ran across it, the impression that a general person has, is that
                        American business in Latin America has tremendous influence on our
                        policy...one thinks of United Fruit, AT&amp;T, the oil companies, etc. What
                        type of influence did they have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: The influence is greatly exaggerated. I know that the perception is that
                    these big multinational corporations have great influence. I have been in a
                    position to know inside and out because I was later in government. I can tell
                    you that the business community gets a fair hearing, but so does the labor. In
                    fact, I would say labor probably has more influence in government. And so do the
                    other sectors of our society. I don't think the business community has any more
                    influence than any other sector. It is just that people focus on it because they
                    think that it has an inordinate role. There are more articles written about
                    it.</p>
                <p>Frankly, I was there at a very interesting time. That perception that you
                    describe was so strong—that is, that the multinational corporations exerted, not
                    only a great influence, but a nefarious influence over US policy. And they
                    focus, by the way, on two or three cases which in my opinion are the exception
                    and not the rule. The ITT case in Chile, and on the United Fruit Company, which
                    really dates back 50, 60, 70 years now. They were real, but you are talking
                    about hundreds and hundreds of corporations over a period of now over a century
                    of involvement in Latin America. The examples of egregious behavior are very
                    few. It is true that they influenced. People do try to influence the behavior of
                    any government that rules over them. In a democracy they do it through
                    established institutions, in other cases they use other means.</p>
                <p>It is true that some of these companies did do the wrong things. But most of them
                    were good corporate citizens. They contributed, through taxes and employment, a
                    great deal to the economic development of Latin America. In fact, there have
                    been books written by Latin Americans...not just Americans, justifying their
                    investment. In fact, North Americans tend to be more critical of the involvement
                    than many Latin Americans. Because North Americans look at it from a distance.
                    You have books like “Bitter Fruit” that criticized the involvement of US
                    corporations, but there is another side of the story which is the one that shows
                    that the technology that has been imported in Latin America has been brought by
                    American corporations. Safety and health standards have been improved by
                    American corporations. Unfortunately, the local entrepreneurs tend to be much
                    less concerned with health and safety and education and those aspects of work
                    than do the foreign investors.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>The foreign investors are more concerned about their image as foreigners and feel
                    they want to do something positive. Plus, they transfer the same management
                    methods that they have in the United States down to other countries. Usually,
                    you don't find people trying to get away from their responsibilities in Mexico,
                    say, that they have in Minnesota. They do tend to treat the workers in the same
                    way there as they do here. When an American company settles into a country, you
                    have an enormous amount of demand for those jobs. The average worker would much
                    rather work for an American corporation than for a local corporation.</p>
                <p>Going back to the perception issue, there was something that doesn't even exist
                    any more, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee had something call the
                    Multinational Corporations Subcommittee. A subcommittee was formed just to look
                    into these abuses, real and alleged, by multinational corporations. The '70s was
                    a very difficult period for corporations. There were some abuses, by the way, by
                    those people looking into the abuses—abuses by the investigators. I think that
                    is one of the reasons the subcommittee no longer exists. But there were some
                    real abuses uncovered and I think even those companies who were not guilty of
                    them became much more conscious of their social responsibilities, their
                    corporate responsibility. But even before that, I remember the Council of the
                    Americas did a survey, which was my idea, surveying the Council member companies
                    asking them if they could give us examples of what they were doing socially that
                    didn't have an impact on their bottom line, or if in fact it did have an impact
                    it was a loss. It was amazing how many corporations were involved in setting up
                    dispensaries in far away distant regions of the country where they felt they had
                    some impact. They were the only entity who had the resources to do something
                    like this. They set up schools, had scholarship programs for the children of
                    their employees, etc. We are talking not of a government but corporations whose
                    principal interest is staying in business, making a profit. But they were using
                    those profits to do some very useful things. We can get into the argument that
                    they were exploiting this and that, but the fact is that I think it has been
                    pretty well proven that they were not exploiting.</p>
                <p>In fact, as a student of Latin American economics, I can tell you that the Latin
                    American countries themselves have been a victim of the perception that these
                    countries were exploiters, because when they acted on that perception. For
                    example, the Andean Pact in 1970 passed a very restrictive foreign investment
                    code in the belief that these corporations were rapacious but would invest
                    anyway because they were making such enormous profits. The fact is, they made
                    such marginal profits that when that restrictive investment code was passed,
                    there was zero foreign investment in some of those countries for many, many
                    years, until the Andean Pact's Decision 24 was repealed in 1976. Countries like
                    Peru have never recovered from that particular action.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>This affects US foreign policy. It affects the perception of US foreign policy by
                    the American people, the Congress. And it is something that deserves a lot more
                    study by a lot more objective people. A lot of scholars, frankly, have gone into
                    this with real prejudices. They have gone in to prove that these corporations
                    were bad. And you can use statistics to prove almost anything you want.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived at AID in 1981...there seemed to be a
                        particularly bloody transition in personnel, as compared to Near Eastern,
                        Asian, European Affairs. It seemed that a lot of ideology went over to the
                        ARA side which was not evident elsewhere. How did you look at the
                        transition?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: First of all, I can't tell you first hand because I was not part of that
                    early transition period. I can only tell you from hearsay or secondhand
                    information. In my opinion what happened, having worked for Bush before...it is
                    interesting because just yesterday I was speaking to a former colleague who is
                    now at the White House about that election and that transition and telling him
                    that the collegiality that existed prior to election day seemed to disappear the
                    day after election day. There was this very aggressive competition for the top
                    jobs that were going to come up. I don't think out of greed, but out of a desire
                    to be in a position of power. A lot of people, like myself, were simply left
                    out. I was not asked to participate in a transition team. So I missed a lot of
                    that blood-letting that you are talking about. But I did watch it closely, and a
                    lot of people that I had worked for were in the transition.</p>
                <p>I think what happened was that the Reagan people felt that they had some scores
                    to settle, plus there was some genuine shock at the actions of the Carter
                    Administration in Latin America and also around the world. Let's face it, 1979,
                    for example, was the year not only of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, but
                    the fall of the Shah, the Sandinista victory in Nicaragua, the takeover by
                    Maurice Bishop in Grenada. It was a disaster for United States foreign policy.
                    And a lot of the people in the Reagan team felt that the Foreign Service had not
                    acted in a strong enough manner to stop some of these Carter blunders.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>Some, I think, ideologically sympathized with the Carter Administration, but in
                    my opinion, because I know most if not all of the people who were involved, by
                    the end of the Carter Administration they were in a state of shock. I know for a
                    fact, and I won't mention any names, but some of them were trying to stop some
                    of the actions of the Carter Administration. By that, I mean trying to set the
                    policy back on the right track. The right track meaning one that would service
                    the interests of the United States and not lead to disaster such as the
                    Sandinista victory in Nicaragua. That, and the Salvadoran coup later on in
                    October, 1979 and the Maurice Bishop overthrow of the government in Grenada in
                    March, 1979 really energized a lot of the conservative foreign policy community.
                    People were wondering what was going on. What was the Foreign Service doing? Why
                    weren't they raising alarms? And, frankly, I have to say in all honesty, some of
                    the Foreign Service people in charge did not help their case. They made
                    statements as late as October, 1980 that apologized for the Carter mistakes.</p>
                <p>That month I organized a meeting of the Council of the Americas, on Central
                    America, which was very well attended. It was at the International Club in
                    Washington. Over 200 corporate representatives came. The career Foreign Service
                    people in charge of our policy were vehemently defending the policy. The policy
                    had failed and I don't see how somebody could defend what was going on in
                    Central America. It was going up in flames. It was not good for the people of
                    Central America.</p>
                <p>So, yes, there was a group of people who came in...who came in for ideological
                    reasons, or for others...I think there were some personal reasons involved as
                    well...and did a house cleaning in the ARA Bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came over to work on Latin America in AID, how
                        did AID fit in the Department in the ARA Bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: I started Labor Day weekend. In fact it was exactly ten years ago this
                    weekend. It was Labor Day weekend of 1981. So the Reagan Administration was
                    already several months old...the reason it took that long was my credentials,
                    perhaps...I was not right wing enough for some people. When I was finally
                    cleared, they realized that they needed people who had more than just
                    ideological credentials but other credentials. By then, also, Tom Enders had
                    been the Assistant Secretary for several months. He was a very strong
                    personality and had basically taken control of the ARA Bureau. My job was to
                    deal with Tom Enders, but I also had to deal with my own chain of command, Peter
                    McPherson, who was the head of AID...all of my colleagues in the other foreign
                    policy or other agencies like OMB, Treasury and others who had some relationship
                    to the economic development work. Part of my job was sort of diplomatic, trying
                    to find the most support for our foreign economic policies and find resources
                    for them as well. There is a constant battle for resources in the
                    government.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>I benefitted from the fact that Ronald Reagan and George Bush— by the way...we
                    shouldn't leave Bush out, he has always been interested in Latin America and his
                    actions as President have more than supported that...he has been very interested
                    in Latin America — both Reagan and Bush were making a lot of statements about
                    the need to not only get involved in Latin America to stop communism, but to
                    deal with the causes of the social problems in Latin America. We all recognized
                    that, and I frankly think it is pathetic that opponents of the policy keep
                    saying that all the Reagan Administration wanted to do was to stop communism and
                    put right wing governments in power. That is simply false. It didn't happen.</p>
                <p>In fact, we were supporting the reformers. Napoleon Duarte, for example, in El
                    Salvador. He was tortured and thrown out of the country because he was seen as a
                    socialist. We had well meaning conservatives from the United States and Latin
                    America coming to us, to me as Assistant Administrator of AID to argue against
                    helping Duarte and other centrists. (and I later paid a political price for it,
                    almost didn't get confirmed as Ambassador because of the actions I took as
                    Assistant Administrator of AID in supporting social programs, such as the land
                    reform in El Salvador, which I think were very much needed).</p>
                <p>These programs were not socialist, in my opinion, they were not collectivist
                    programs. They were programs designed to break up the huge land estates...El
                    Salvador had the most skewed land tenure system in all of Latin America. Most
                    was owned by ten or twelve families. We were not doing it to be nasty to those
                    people, it was the fact that there was real social injustice, poverty and hunger
                    in that country. And it was not going to be resolved until the land tenure
                    system was dealt with.</p>
                <p>So a land reform program was designed in three stages that included one that was
                    called “land to the tiller”, which was designed to give land to the person at
                    the bottom rung of the socio-economic ladder land. I will never forget going to
                    El Salvador later on , and going to some of these farms and having people
                    practically kiss my hand when they realized I was the faceless person in
                    Washington who had supported these programs. The people they associated with the
                    program were those who were on the ground...for example, farm extension service
                    people we had hired from Puerto Rico, or AID people in the mission, or experts
                    from Washington that we had hired.</p>
                <p>I remember one peasant putting his arm around this Puerto Rican extension agent
                    who was working with him as part of our land reform support group, saying, “God
                    sent us this man.” This man was helping him to become a self-sufficient
                    entrepreneur instead of just a farm hand. These were the kind of people who
                    literally didn't have enough money to put shoes on their children's feet. They
                    were share croppers who owned everything to a local landowner. Here the United
                    States comes along supporting an indigenous land reform program. It is not a
                    program that we instituted. This was the government of El Salvador's program. We
                    were supporting that program and it was the right thing to do.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>Later on, by the way to jump ahead a few years, when I was nominated as
                    Ambassador, Senator Jesse Helms, who always philosophically opposed the land
                    reform program and still does, held up my nomination for quite a while, to the
                    point where Senator Richard Lugar, who was then the Chairman of the Foreign
                    Relations Committee, had to intervene at the request of the White House. I had
                    known Senator Lugar, we had worked together on a number of things. He held
                    hearings on my nomination over the objections of Senator Helms. That was the
                    only reason I became an Ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can we talk a bit about Senator Helms, because he is a
                        very important figure, particularly in Latin American policy. Conservative
                        Senator from North Carolina. What motivates or has motivated him in this
                        type of thing? Is it his staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: He has a very...when I say has, by the way, I am speaking historical
                    times, back in the 1980s...I had many dealings with him and his staff. First, to
                    be confirmed as Assistant Administrator for AID I had to go before his
                    committee. He tried to block my nomination as Assistant Administrator for AID
                    because when I was the Washington Director of the Council of the Americas, from
                    '77 to '81, the Council of the Americas had supported the Panama Canal
                    Treaties.</p>
                <p>I told you I had served in the army in Panama and I knew the United States could
                    defend its interests in a Panama canal while giving back to Panama the 500
                    square miles of territory and the sovereignty that it controlled. I had read a
                    lot of historical documents, I read books while I was in Panama about its
                    history. In fact, the treaty that ceded this land to the United States said that
                    the United States had these rights “as if it were sovereign.”That phrase, by the
                    way, became almost like a bloody shirt that was thrown back and forth between
                    the opponents and the proponents of the Panama Canal Treaties in the '70s. I was
                    right in the middle of that. That was when I was in charge of the Washington
                    office of the Council of the Americas...The Council, as I said, was probably the
                    most conservative organization that supported the Panama Canal Treaties. In the
                    view of other conservatives, that made it a leftist organization, which of
                    course is laughable. But the Council supported the Panama Canal Treaties for the
                    same reason that I personally had supported them, which is, as I said, I felt
                    the United States could defend its legitimate interests in the operation of the
                    Canal, maintain the Canal open, operational and neutral, which was a bit of a
                    catch phrase at the time, and have good relations with Panama and the rest of
                    Latin America.</p>
                <p>Latin America really did support Panama's claim to this territory. And frankly in
                    retrospect, here we are in 1991, 14 years after the signing of the treaty, and I
                    think our interests are very much protected and our relations with Latin America
                    have never been better. Not just because of that, but I think it helped.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>So, Jesse Helms tried to block my nomination, Frankly caused me a great deal of
                    difficulty, to the point where I went to Peter McPherson, who was then the
                    Administrator of AID and offered to resign, I had been brought in as a Special
                    Assistant to McPherson while the nomination process was going through the
                    clearance process. McPherson refused. He was very principled and decided this
                    opposition to me was not only wrong but unfair. When I was nominated, there was
                    a real campaign against me. They said I was too liberal because of the Panama
                    Canal position and because I had also been in the Democratic Party...remember I
                    had been a Democrat and had worked in the 1972 campaign. I never hid that. I
                    listed that in all of my White House personnel papers.</p>
                <p>When I offered to resign McPherson said, “No, you are the right man for this job.
                    The White House thinks you are the right man for this job. We are going to stick
                    by the nomination, if you are willing to withstand the heat.” I said, “Yes, I
                    am.” So we went forward with it and got people like Jeane Kirkpatrick, who had
                    known me and with whom I had worked within the Reagan campaign, after the Bush
                    campaign. She called Jesse Helms and said, “Look, I know Otto Reich. He is a
                    refugee from communist Cuba and very anti-communist. It is true that he was a
                    Democrat, but so was I, and so was Ronald Reagan.” So she, and other people,
                    convinced Helms, and he relented...I'm sure it was something he regretted later
                    on when he found out I was supporting the land reform. I had a lot of dealings
                    with him and his staff through hearings on the programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find his staff to be zealous?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: Yes. And I say this by the way, and it may not show in the transcript—I am
                    saying this with a smile on my face, because people like Chris Manion knows...he
                    and I have had long discussions. He was the principal staffer with whom I had to
                    deal with, but he has others who are real zealots on this subject. And, by the
                    way, very intelligent and very dedicated people, but philosophically totally
                    opposed to some of the things that the Reagan Administration was doing. We used
                    to drive them crazy. I would come to the hearings with quotations from Ronald
                    Reagan on these subjects, to prove it wasn't Otto Reich dictating policy. Later
                    on in my hearings for ambassador, I reminded Senator Helms that on January 3,
                    1981 when he was still President-elect Reagan, 17 days before his swearing in,
                    Ronald Reagan said that he would support the land reform in El Salvador. It was
                    true, and it would drive the Helms people crazy because they were trying to show
                    that here was the government run amuck. It wasn't just the career Foreign
                    Service people. But now they had co-opted even the political appointees. Look at
                    Otto Reich. He had a pretty good record, although we knew he was soft on the
                    Panama Canal, but they co-opted him.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>What I was pointing out was that this was Ronald Reagan's position; the position
                    of the Secretary of State, Alexander Haig and then George Shultz; the position
                    of the AID Administrator, of course, they also thought McPherson was soft and he
                    had a lot of problems with Helms on other issues—the population program and
                    things like that.</p>
                <p>We pointed out that real Americans like Douglas MacArthur had helped to
                    democratize a country like Japan through programs like land reform and that we
                    could do the same thing in Central America...or help the Central Americans do
                    this thing for themselves...but they needed resources.</p>
                <p>So it was a good philosophical battle. But it did have its ugly side to it. In
                    fairness to Senator Helms, let me say for the record, the Administration did not
                    do a good job of answering some of his real concerns about the land reform. I
                    have to say that it was not until my nomination as Ambassador to Venezuela that
                    some of these questions were answered. Because when he held up the nomination,
                    and after Senator Lugar held hearings on me, Helms came to the hearings and
                    asked a lot of questions, which he has the right to do, and then gave me a set
                    of written questions, which is one of his ploys, by the way. In my case it was a
                    small number of questions, not 150 like he asked other people. But they were
                    good questions, and they had not been answered. Frankly, I was in a bit of a
                    shock to find out that these questions from Helms had not been answered, by
                    either my Bureau when I was Assistant Administrator, by my successors or by the
                    State Department. So I asked McPherson, who was still Administrator, to give me
                    a couple of people to go through the files and find the records to show how we
                    had supported land reform in the free market way that Helms felt the US should
                    support. Helms thought we had supported a collectivist program. What we had
                    supported was the “land to the tiller” program, with titles to the land. The
                    peasants were to be the owners of the land, not the state, and not a collective.
                    That seemed to satisfy Helms, when he saw that we had worked hard in 1981, and
                    '82 and '83, and successfully, to make this a free market and a democratic land
                    reform, not a socialist land reform. Helms was absolutely rights as a US Senator
                    to exercise oversight over these programs. It had been our mistake, perhaps
                    based on arrogance and exaggerated views of executive privilege, to deny him the
                    information.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>That is not to say that Helms didn't like to harass executive branch nominees, or
                    use them to prove a point. One question was, “Please list every meeting, with
                    dates and places, you have ever attended in the US government where land reform
                    was discussed.” Now, that question is impossible to answer because as Assistant
                    Administrator for two years I attended meetings every day. I had a daily staff
                    meeting and every day some aspect of land reform was discussed. That was a
                    harassment question, so I answered it, and I am surprised he accepted it, by
                    saying something like: “Between September 4, 1981 (approximately my first day at
                    AID) and the time I was nominated Ambassador to Venezuela I attended every
                    meeting where land reform was discussed when I was in Washington plus meetings
                    in El Salvador when I was in the field.” I answered it a little more
                    articulately than that, but he accepted that answer. I was being truthful. I
                    discussed land reform every time the subject came up. We also discussed a lot of
                    other things. We weren't obsessed with land reform in El Salvador, but that was
                    the object of his questions. We had, unfortunately, to deal with many other
                    crises at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While we are talking about land reform, was it limited
                        pretty much to El Salvador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: Land reform was limited pretty much to El Salvador, although we had
                    smaller programs in countries like Honduras. Another little anecdote which I
                    never will forget because it brought tears to my eyes: I made several trips to
                    Honduras. There was a land title ceremony scheduled which our mission in
                    Honduras had delayed until my visit, to give it a little more pizzazz. They held
                    this ceremony, where we actually gave the titles to the new owners, the
                    peasants, in a town deep in the interior of Honduras. We flew up near there and
                    then took jeeps to the small town. We went into the government building on the
                    plaza where the men, and one woman, who were to get titles to land, waited.
                    There was the American flag and the Honduran flag, a Honduran official and
                    myself who gave out the titles. It was an emotional thing to make these people
                    owners of the land they had worked for many generations. I particularly remember
                    the woman; she was carrying a baby in her arms. I don't know if she was a single
                    mother, a widow, a divorcee... As I gave her the title to her land, I couldn't
                    help but imagine how hard life must be for a young female in a “machista”
                    country and how much this piece of paper must have meant to her. I was proud of
                    my country, of AID, and of the legislation which enabled us to help these people
                    in far away countries to help themselves. As she took the title in her one free
                    hand, I looked at her face and at the baby in her other arm, and I hope that no
                    one could see that my eyes had clouded over.</p>
                <p>So. we had other programs, but El Salvador was the heart of land reform and the
                    most controversial. There was no controversy in Honduras because the land was
                    purchased by the government. In El Salvador, since most of the country was in
                    the hands of the landowners, there was no way to purchase it. The government
                    expropriated it and then there arranged for compensation.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>By the way, the issue of compensation was another problem that Helms had. That is
                    very complicated because it clashes with his understandably strong feelings
                    about the sanctity of private property.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about population control? This was a major issue, not
                        only in Latin America, but elsewhere. The Reagan Administration seemed to be
                        taking a kind of right turn from what had been the idea that you needed some
                        kind of birth control in some of these third world countries.</hi>

                <p>REICH: You know, it was not an issue, at least not in my Bureau. We had
                    population programs, education and the actual distribution of birth control
                    devices. What helped a lot, I think, in our part of the world was that the
                    Catholic Church had finally decided that their position could be defended on a
                    religious basis, but the result, the actual concrete result of the policy was a
                    population growth rate that was threatening the very survival of the people.
                    They basically looked the other way. For some reason, the other opponents of the
                    policy focused on Asia, on China and didn't focus much on Latin America. We
                    continued the programs.</p>
                <p>We did, however, include the natural rhythm method of birth control as one of the
                    options that would be taught. That seemed fine with me. If it contributes to the
                    end result then it is fine. What some did want to do, though, was to completely
                    eliminate the distribution of birth control devices and replace it only with the
                    teaching of natural ways. In countries where there is nothing to do but have
                    babies, that is not going to work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any great problems in your AID job that you
                        had to deal with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: Problems? It was an enormous amount of fun. I have to say if we hadn't
                    been fighting a war in Central America...one that I wanted to get involved in
                    and other people wanted me to get more involved in...I probably would have
                    continued in that job for a longer time.</p>
                <p>There were management problems, of course. A lot of personnel problems. I was
                    managing 860 people. It is amazing how many personnel problems can emanate from
                    a small group of people. I later found this out in my embassy where I had only a
                    third of the number of people and just as many problems. I think being overseas
                    does contribute to personnel problems. Battling the bureaucracy was a problem at
                    AID. Trying to establish a modus vivendi with my AID colleagues—mainly Tom
                    Enders who was a very strong-minded person. For example, under the Caribbean
                    Basin Initiative AID had an important role to play. We had, of course, all of
                    the responsibility for the aid component was an additional $350 million, which
                    is not peanuts.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>Just to give you an idea of how important that $350 million was, when I took over
                    as AA, (Assistant Administrator for Latin America) the budget we were working
                    with was the last Carter budget, (1981) which was $440 million for all of Latin
                    America and the Caribbean, including the special supplement for Nicaragua (when
                    the Sandinistas came in, the Carter Administration gave them about $110 million
                    to try to show we were friends). If you take out the Sandinista component, that
                    left a regular budget for all of Latin America and the Caribbean of about $340
                    million. So the CBI supplement alone exceeded the entire budget of the previous
                    year.</p>
                <p>I helped to manage not only a doubling, but what turned out to be a quadrupling
                    of aid for Latin America from that Carter budget of $440 million. We ended up
                    three or four years later with about $1.6 billion for Latin America. We had to
                    do that with fewer people, because Reagan came in determined to cut the size of
                    government and there were some across-the-board cuts that affected everybody,
                    even those of us who had additional financial resources to manage. I had my
                    staff cut several times.</p>
                <p>It was a management challenge, but very enjoyable because you knew you were on
                    the cutting edge. It was the fun bureau to be in the early '80s. Africa had
                    taken the resources in the '70s, the Asian bureau in the '60s because of the
                    Vietnam War. But Latin America in the early '80s was once again where it had
                    been in the early '60s with the Alliance for Progress. It helped me to recruit
                    good people within the Agency because people wanted to be where the action was.
                    So I had good luck in being able to attract good personnel, but not as much good
                    luck in being able to get rid of mediocre personnel.</p>
                <p>But we still had to battle the rest of the bureaucracy even in internal AID.
                    There were a lot of jealousies, by the way. The same budget decisions that gave
                    us money took it away from other people. So I had to battle what we call PPC,
                    which was the AID's internal OMB, the budget people. I also had to battle OMB,
                    itself. OMB has the responsibility of looking at the global budget and within
                    the globe there is a foreign policy component. They weren't too happy with Latin
                    America suddenly getting all those resources. So I had to do battle and build
                    political backfires at NSC or the White House in order to retain our
                    resources.</p>
                <p>But I enjoyed that. Being a political appointee, I think it was easier for me. I
                    was willing to do that, to cash in political chips where I could pick up the
                    phone and call somebody at the White House and not worry about my political
                    backside. Because, frankly, if they wanted to fire me, that was all right with
                    me too. And that was the attitude that I had all along in my career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Tom Enders?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>REICH: Tom Enders' view toward AID was what I found to be very typical among
                    people at the State Department. People felt AID was there for the taking, that
                    AID is a component of the State Department that should follow State Department
                    direction. I found myself as a mediator between my Bureau and the rest of the
                    agency and State. I felt, frankly, that we had one only foreign policy with many
                    objectives. There was no need to fight, to have these bureaucratic battles just
                    to see who was in charge of the AID budget. My staff would make fun of my
                    attitude. They used to call me the “one-policy” AA.</p>
                <p>There was a lot of interaction between the two Bureaus and I would always get the
                    complaints. “State is trying to take this program and reduce this”, etc. I would
                    try to work it out with Enders rather than say that this or that was the AID
                    policy and that was that. I think I was right. We won some and lost some. Enders
                    was a very, very intelligent and capable person, as well as strong minded, I
                    think if I hadn't had that attitude it would have caused a lot of problems.
                    There were times when we disagreed and I would have to say no to him. But I
                    think he could see that I was trying to be cooperative.</p>
                <p>So as a result, after the first few months, I really didn't have too many
                    problems with him. I learned a lot from him in terms of bureaucratic skills.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The '80s was a period of real change within Latin America
                        from authoritarian governments to more democratic ones. Part of a great wave
                        that is still going on as we speak today. Were you conscious of using AID as
                        a weapon in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: Yes, very much so. In fact, that was one of the controversies that I was
                    in the middle of, between State, say the political imperatives that we had, and
                    the development objectives. A lot of the AID people believe that we should use
                    this money to “do good”. Fine, nobody objects to that, but we do not have enough
                    resources to “do good” for everybody in the world. We have to put them where
                    they will do the most good, where they can leverage other changes.</p>
                <p>For example, what we called policy reform. We would try to use our aid as
                    leverage for policy reform in countries like Costa Rica, a rich country which
                    had terrible economic policies and had no excuse for not being much more
                    prosperous. A lot of the AID people objected to this forced leverage. They
                    thought that was political pressure, using our AID money for political
                    objectives.</p>
                <p>Well, yes, it was, but the result of the political pressure was that we leveraged
                    economic results in Costa Rica (and other countries) with a couple of hundred
                    million dollars of aid that would have taken billions of dollars to accomplish
                    otherwise if the policy changes had not been forced.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>We would work, for example, with the IMF, the World Bank, the IDB (InterAmerican
                    Development Bank) to bring about some of those changes. Well, the IDB was
                    recalcitrant, they did not want to do this because they were basically at that
                    time also very much in the socialist mode of big government. They supported
                    “import substitution industrialization” and the other theories in Latin America
                    that had failed and had led Latin American to bankruptcy in the 1980s. They have
                    since come along, but it took an upheaval in the IDB and almost took the United
                    States pulling out.</p>
                <p>But the World Bank and the IMF did support these policy changes. The result now,
                    by the way, is that I think we are on the verge of a real take-off in Latin
                    America. Of course, we have been on the verge of a take-off for a couple of
                    centuries now, “he says sarcastically”.</p>
                <p>But there have been changes in Latin America that nobody could have foreseen a
                    few years ago, unless you were doing the kinds of things we were trying to do. I
                    think they are a result of some of the things that we did, although not only
                    because of the things we did. But we did force some real changes in economic
                    policies in Latin America toward free market economics, individual initiative,
                    reduction in the size of the State, while not forgetting the people at the
                    bottom. I honestly believe that we did more for the people at the bottom of the
                    socio-economic scale in Latin America in the 1980s than had been done in the
                    '70s and '60s under programs that sound much better to the academic community or
                    liberal community. They opposed us saying we were supporting big business. But
                    we were trying to create employment, to get those countries off of welfare, in
                    effect. And I think it is happening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this period, you were there from 1981-83, and
                        obviously what you do then won't have its major affect until later on, but
                        can you point to some of the countries where things really worked?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: Costa Rica is very much one of those countries. Salvador...we have talked
                    a lot about Salvador but you have to remember that it was the headache. The
                    support of land report in Salvador...the fact that the Reagan Administration,
                    conservative, anti-communist, supported programs that helped the people of
                    Salvador at the lowest levels, as well as higher levels, by the way...we had a
                    lot of programs, but the land reform was one.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>The question of policy reform is one. Costa Rica was a country that had I believe
                    the third highest per capita debt in the world when we came in. There is no
                    reason for a country like Costa Rica to be that way...I have been to Costa Rica
                    many times and I love it. It is not only beautiful but it has many resources and
                    the people are very nice. We persuaded the government of Costa Rica to change
                    the subsidies and other programs that were bankrupting that nation and to have
                    more confidence in the ability of the average Costa Rican to decided what to do
                    with his or her own money, for instance. reducing the size of the State. It
                    didn't take that many years, but it did take awhile. By the mid '80s we could
                    see the result. Frankly, in some of our programs we could see the results in one
                    year, because those countries had been headed in the wrong direction for so long
                    that a little bit of help and a violent veer and pulling on one side of the
                    reins hard did change the direction of the country very quickly. We could see
                    that in many countries in Central America.</p>
                <p>My frustration was Guatemala. I was able to do absolutely zero in Guatemala
                    because the government there was a military, dictatorial one. We were unable to
                    do anything.</p>
                <p>In the Caribbean there was our support for micro-enterprises, for example. One of
                    the philosophical changes we brought to AID was...replacing the emphasis on
                    dealing with big government with supporting small entrepreneurs. One change, a
                    person who you may have heard of who has written a book called “The Other Path”
                    about development in Peru, Hernando DeSoto...When I was at AID we gave his
                    institute a grant, the first US government support of this group, called the
                    Institute for Liberty and Development, in Peru that supports the notion of
                    individual initiative and has proven that, for example, up to 60 percent of the
                    Peruvian GNP was produced outside of the formal sector. Most of these people
                    would be able to participate and contribute (these people didn't even pay taxes
                    because they are outside the formal sector) if the government didn't have so
                    many impediments to their doing business. We gave the first outside assistance
                    to the man who was practically unknown at the time. He was trying to get
                    recognition and I think that helped.</p>
                <p>You know, it is amazing, here ten years later I still run into examples like
                    that. I was at a meeting not too long ago where somebody came up to me (I had
                    totally forgotten the person) and said, “I don't know if you remember me, but I
                    visited you in your office when you were in AID and I am with such-and-such an
                    organization (let's just leave it anonymous) and you gave us a little grant that
                    enabled us to create a number of enterprises and we are now self-sufficient. I
                    just wanted to thank you.” This makes you feel good.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>Another battle with State: I always felt that the middle income countries in
                    Latin America—the Colombias, the Venezuelas, the Brazils, the Mexicos, the
                    Chiles, the Argentinas—should not be ignored by AID, but our resources were so
                    limited that we had to focus on the poorest of the poor. That was, also by the
                    way, a Congressional mandate of the 1970s. But I felt that we needed a program
                    to try to do something about the lack of development, the uneven development of
                    some of these countries. Having been in Venezuela, I can tell you there are
                    people there just as poor and just as hungry as they are in Salvador or
                    Honduras. I knew that we could not put money into these middle income countries,
                    however,...for one thing their per capita income levels are too high, our law
                    prohibited it...and also frankly it isn't fair. They had the resources that they
                    could put to work in those sectors of society that had been ignored.</p>
                <p>But I felt there were a lot of things that we could do—technical assistance and
                    other kinds of assistance. I wanted to have an AID representative in the
                    embassy, working with the economic section and the ambassador to identify areas
                    were we could cooperate: technical assistance in agriculture and science, in
                    industry, in population programs, etc. We only had population programs in
                    Mexico, Colombia and Brazil. We only had AIDREPS, as we used to call them, in
                    those three countries. I thought they should do a lot more than just that, plus
                    I thought they should be in other countries.</p>
                <p>State didn't want to do it, AID didn't want to do it. I talked to the people at
                    the White House and they thought it was a good idea and they included it in
                    President Reagan's speech in Bogota, Colombia in 1982 and then it became policy.
                    Now everybody is for it. State is very happy with the program and we now have
                    AIDREPS in many, many more countries. We have them in Uruguay, Paraguay, Chile
                    and other countries, plus they are doing a lot more. Nobody remembers who was
                    behind that. I almost got my head handed to me for going around the chain of
                    command to get it done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is very interesting to somebody reading this in later
                        times. You are saying to get something done you talked to somebody in the
                        White House and got it put in a speech by the President and suddenly
                        everybody is all for it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: It wasn't that simple, by the way. I simplified it for the purpose of
                    brevity here. But I tell you, I first went through the system. I proposed the
                    “advanced developing country” strategy. I ran it up the flag pole in AID and
                    nobody saluted, in fact they ran the flag down saying that the resources were
                    not available, forget it. So, I went to State thinking they would be interested
                    in gaining additional influence in bringing our countries together. No, State
                    didn't want to do it because they figured AID was going to screw it up.
                    Unfortunately there was a lot of that attitude at State.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>I kept insisting and went to the person who was handling Latin America at the NSC
                    at the time. I said, “Look, this is my idea...” They thought it was a good idea
                    so they included it in the draft...I had included it in the AID portion of the
                    draft of the President's speech for Colombia (he was going to take a trip to
                    South America—Brazil, Colombia, and other places) that was going over to the
                    White House. It had been taken out. So I had it inserted back in the draft at
                    the White House. When the draft came back to State it was taken out a second
                    time. It was one paragraph that said in effect that we need to work with
                    countries such as Colombia and other advanced developing countries in areas such
                    as science and technology, etc. and I (the President speaking) “am going to
                    direct AID to...” I forget the exact wording. The fact is that at the very last
                    minute, on Air Force One, when it was too late for State to take it out, that
                    paragraph was reinserted, Reagan read it and it was policy. It was policy but
                    with a lot of people against it.</p>
                <p>There was a time lag, the moment I just described was in 1982, I left in 1983 and
                    there were people still opposing it, but a couple of years later people said,
                    “Oh, this is policy; we are supposed to be doing this.” And then the attitude
                    changed and they started implementing what the President had mentioned three or
                    four years earlier. And then they thought it was a good idea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned Caribbean. During your time where did you
                        see the problems in the Caribbean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: The economies are so small...I don't want to say not viable, which was the
                    term used then...I think they are viable; they are alive, but barely alive. The
                    economies of the Caribbean are so small that they have to find some way to unite
                    in some kind of economic union and come up with comparative advantages. They
                    can't all produce bananas, or attract tourism. That is basically what some of
                    those countries do. Dominica, for example, barely has tourism. All it has is
                    bananas. What we tried to do was to help them develop some non-traditional
                    exports and attract non-traditional investments. It wasn't easy because the
                    market is so small. Each one of these countries...you have a population of
                    100,000. It is very hard to convince a corporation that is large enough to have
                    the resources to invest in such a small market. The size of the market was one
                    of the things that was restraining us in terms of finding economic development
                    formulae that would work.</p>
                <p>As far as the traditional AID programs, they were expanding considerably. I
                    think, in fact, they were tripled while I was there. Now there is very little
                    attention being paid to the Caribbean, not because the people who are there
                    don't care as much as we do, they just don't have the resources. Resources have
                    followed the policies to other places and the problems in the Caribbean have
                    continued to grow—population, for example.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you tell how you felt about developments in Central
                        America which was the focus of our policy...basically El Salvador and the
                        Nicaragua situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: Well, I felt that they were important enough that I decided to change my
                    job, my career path, or whatever you want to call it, to give up that AID job
                    which I liked so much and felt hadn't finished. I feel bad, even to this day,
                    about leaving AID, because I didn't feel I had been there long enough—less than
                    two years, which is, of course, a normal tour of duty. But when I took the job I
                    assumed that I would be there for the entire first Reagan term. So I feel that I
                    left the job half finished. I didn't even get, for example, to visit my South
                    American posts. Central America simply dominated so much of our time. I only got
                    to half the Caribbean posts.</p>
                <p>I felt that what was going on in Central America was so important to the United
                    States and so misunderstood by the American people and it had such a potential
                    for going wrong, that I had to contribute something.</p>
                <p>When you are in government you have a circle of friends and you are constantly
                    talking to people and exchanging ideas and you do tend to talk shop all the
                    time. There was a group of political appointees that got together in the Van
                    Buren Room on the eighth floor of the State Department and talked about these
                    things. We became increasingly concerned ...progressively from '81, '82,
                    '83...as it seemed the Sandinistas were getting stronger and more repressive.
                    The Cubans were more and more active militarily throughout Central America. The
                    Salvadoran war was going the wrong way in spite of our best efforts. The
                    Administration was not getting the resources from Congress that it felt it
                    needed. So I volunteered to head up an office that had yet to be created. I
                    found out that President Reagan was very frustrated because he kept going to the
                    American people and explaining the policy, yet there was very little support for
                    the policy. We felt that this was because the media basically opposed to the
                    Reagan Administration, and I think it still is—still opposed to the idea of
                    Reagan in many ways. A lot of people in the media (I know this because it was my
                    job for the next years) distorted the facts about Central America. I know
                    reporters who, although they opposed the Reagan policy, quit their jobs because
                    they would go down to Central America, see that the Administration was telling
                    the truth, file stories that were killed by their editors back here because the
                    editors were watching CBS News or reading the New York Times, and had a
                    different idea and thought the reporters had been coopted by the Reagan
                    Administration. It was very interesting.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>It was the opposite of what the right wing felt...You know when I said earlier
                    that the Helms people thought we, the political appointees, had been coopted by
                    the State Department, a lot of these editors thought that their reporters were
                    being coopted by the Reagan Administration. I felt strongly enough about that I
                    decided to go into this public diplomacy effort. That was a killer. It was
                    something that even to this day I still get phone calls from people wanting to
                    know if I was really involved in propaganda efforts. I remember my deputy in
                    AID, Marshall Brown, said, “Don't do it.” when I told him that I was going to be
                    doing this in 1983. He said, “Don't do it. You are going to be labeled as the
                    hatchet man.” It is interesting because he was so prophetic. He was a career AID
                    person...</p>
                <p>[end of tape 1]</p>
                <p>...Marshall Brown, whose nickname was Buster, told me that I was making a
                    mistake. Of course, he wanted me to stay because we had a very good team in AID
                    and were having a good time. He felt that I brought something to the AID
                    bureau...he particularly liked my willingness to go to the White House if
                    necessary and bypass the bureaucracy to get whatever we needed. He warned me and
                    he was right that this public diplomacy effort was a highly political and highly
                    visible job that would require me to take on institutions such as the media and
                    the Congress who don't like to lose. He was right. I took them on and we won a
                    few battles, but then Ollie North threw a few hand grenades into the whole
                    operation and some of us caught some of the shrapnel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would like to get into the whole public diplomacy thing
                        because this is part of the story.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: What happened was, in talking to people, both career and non career, in
                    State, the White House, etc., it was obvious that something needed to be done to
                    try to win the war in Central America. We were really getting bogged down, there
                    and here. There was the danger in the view of a lot of people that this was
                    becoming another Vietnam, in that Vietnam was lost not in the rice paddies of
                    Southeast Asia, but in Washington.</p>
                <p>They wanted to avoid this, so this Office of Public Diplomacy was created. First,
                    by the way, the President named former Senator Richard Stone as a Special
                    Advisor dealing with public diplomacy, but he was at the White House. State
                    didn't like this. They didn't like somebody “fooling around” with foreign policy
                    not in the State bureaucracy. In April of 1983, the President addressed a joint
                    session of Congress on the crisis in Central America. This was only the eight or
                    ninth time since the end of World War II that a President had addressed a joint
                    session of Congress for a specific purpose other than a State of the Union
                    Address, let's say. It was a demonstration of the level of the crisis. Reagan
                    announced a number of actions. One was the appointment of the Kissinger
                    Commission, and one was the appointment of Senator Stone as his special envoy to
                    Central America (a roving envoy like Phil Habib had been for the Middle East,
                    for example).</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>One of the measures that was not announced at the time but came up simultaneously
                    was the creation of the Office of Public Diplomacy. So I, in effect, took
                    Senator Stone's position but George Shultz, the Secretary of State, insisted
                    that this position be moved from the White House to State. I had no objection to
                    that. Later, by the way, people said that Shultz objected to it. Shultz didn't
                    object to the creation of the position. (I also found out later that my “well”
                    had been poisoned with Secretary Shultz by some bureaucrats at State who didn't
                    want me, an outsider, dealing with in “turf”. It took me over a year to gain
                    Shultz's confidence). He wanted it under State and I thought that was fine.
                    Frankly, I preferred it under State because the White House didn't have many
                    resources. The White House staff is very lean. State has a lot more resources
                    and I thought I had a much better chance of getting people and budget—not a
                    large budget, the most I ended up with was one million dollars—and office
                    space.</p>
                <p>This office was to be the coordinator of the efforts to declassify information
                    and put it out and try to show that we were telling the truth about Central
                    America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At this point because somebody is going to be reading this
                        sometime in the future, what was the situation as you saw in Central
                        America?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: The situation, and here we run into the danger of my adding my own sense
                    of drama to it...but I remember sitting at the airport in Tegucigalpa, for a
                    flight, sometime in 1983. I was already in the Public Diplomacy job. There was
                    another one of those massive guerrilla offensives in El Salvador and it
                    threatened to cross over the border into Honduras. The Sandinistas had
                    undertaken a massive military buildup. They had wiped out the Miskito Indian
                    population in the north. They were killing people all over the place. We had
                    this bad feeling sitting in the airport with two or three people from my
                    office...one of them had been a US Army officer in Vietnam and was assigned to
                    the Pentagon and later detailed to my office. (We had purposefully not had any
                    intelligence community people so no one could accuse this thing of being some
                    kind of a CIA plot—which they later did anyway). Fortunately it was proven that
                    it was not any kind of a CIA operation, it didn't need to be because CIA was
                    giving us all the information we wanted.</p>
                <p>Anyway, this Colonel, Larry Tracy, who had been in the army in Vietnam, said,
                    “This reminds me a lot of the Tet offensive.” There was that kind of feeling
                    that Central America was about to fall...that Central America was going to fall
                    like dominoes, the famous domino theory. There was a sense of gloom and doom in
                    the Administration then that the policy simply wasn't working. My job, as I saw
                    it, was to buy time for the policy to work. Easier said than done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we get to that, how did you see the regime in
                        Nicaragua and the movement in El Salvador?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>REICH: I saw the regime in Nicaragua as a group of third world, totalitarian,
                    Marxists. A bunch of opportunists, frankly. They didn't mind losing the election
                    (in 1990) so much as they minded losing the houses they stole and their other
                    privileges. As someone said to me the other day, “I don't mind you taking my
                    philosophy away from me but I do mind you taking my Mercedes.” But they were
                    brutal. They were typical third world brutal dictators with the added
                    Marxist/Leninist ideology, which has proven effective only in one thing and that
                    is in staying in power, in the USSR up until the 1980s. Seventy-five years,
                    however, is a heck of a long time and I didn't want to see a 75-year
                    dictatorship in all of Central America. And I was convinced, by the way, that
                    they were what they said they were...the “liberators”, in their own mind, of
                    Central America. Borge, the Interior Minister of Nicaragua said that their
                    revolution knew no frontiers. They were supporting, as they still are, even
                    after the election of Violeta Chamorro, they still gave anti-aircraft missiles
                    to the Salvadoran guerrillas. It has been admitted by them, although they said
                    it was a bunch of rogue comandantes who did that recently. Come on.</p>
                <p>I saw the regime in El Salvador as trying to do the best...Duarte, I think, was a
                    good man, a reformist and a democrat...somebody who we could support. It
                    definitely was a transitional government to something much more legitimate. He
                    was appointed to his first term by the Junta, but later he was elected, and I
                    think he really did represent the will of the people of El Salvador. But it was
                    still a very imperfect government supported by a very imperfect military, some
                    of whom were and still are corrupt, some of whom were and still are brutal.</p>
                <p>But, frankly, they, like the Nicaraguans reflect their societies. It is not that
                    they are brutal because they are left wing or right wing. They are brutal
                    because of the culture. The culture has been one of violence in that region of
                    the world. More disputes are settled by machete than by any other means. They
                    don't go to court to solve disputes. It is unfortunately a very violent culture,
                    as is most of the northern part of Central America. Surprisingly not Costa Rica
                    and Panama so much. In fact one of the interesting things about Noriega [the
                    leader of Panama who is presently in a Miami jail] was that he was an exception
                    to the history of Panama.</p>
                <p>So that was the picture at that time. It was a very gloomy picture. I remember
                    waking up every morning and going outside my house to pick up the newspaper and
                    looking at it with one eye closed because I was afraid to see what the headline
                    was going to be. The press was not contributing...I remember one Saturday
                    morning the Washington Post had a banner headline across the top—US Combat
                    Troops To Central America. It was like the war had broken out. The actual truth
                    was that some US forces had been sent to Honduras on maneuvers. We never
                    committed any ground forces to Central America. But there was this hysteria in
                    the press that the Reagan Administration really wanted another Vietnam war or
                    something like it. Absolutely false. Everything we did was designed to keep US
                    forces out. The presence of US advisers fro example...of course, people thought
                    that this was we started in Vietnam.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>But we learned our lessons from Vietnam and I think the Central American policy
                    has been successful. It was composed of four elements which we called the four
                    Ds—Democracy, Development, Dialogue and Defense. So there was a political
                    component, an economic component, a diplomatic component and a military
                    component. The military one was the only one that got attention. When I was at
                    AID, I was in charge of the development component, the economic development, or
                    a large part of it. We had a very strong dialogue component. We know now from
                    defectors and from people who were in the Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry that the
                    Sandinistas were just stringing us along. They didn't want a dialogue. They felt
                    they were strong and were going to win the wars and all Central America was
                    going to be Marxist/ Leninist.</p>
                <p>Anyway, a lot of people in this country didn't want to believe that. They thought
                    that their government was lying to them and it was my job in the Public
                    Diplomacy Office to try to prove that we were telling the truth. I think we made
                    a lot of gains. If you look at the period from 1983-86 we got the aid for
                    Salvador, we got the aid for the Contras...getting the aid through Congress was
                    part of my portfolio.</p>
                <p>All of this was thoroughly investigated during the Iran-Contra hearings, as you
                    can imagine. So the political opponents, people who really didn't like what I
                    was doing later on had to be satisfied with saying that the Office was a
                    propaganda office. And that kind of stuck. What can I say? Nobody ever accused
                    us of saying one thing that was not true. And I am very proud of that. How could
                    they say it was propaganda? Well, because we were putting out information that
                    was supporting the President's statements, and the President had many political
                    opponents.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is September 24, 1991. This is the second interview
                        with Ambassador Otto Reich. We left off where I was asking you if you had a
                        problem with this public diplomacy in telling the truth, because the truth
                        is a two-edged weapon—you are trying to put out one thing...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: We were putting out our version of the truth, obviously. Yes, we had a
                    number of problems. One was, and I think this is of particular interest to those
                    people who may be studying the State Department structure for this kind of
                    thing...In my opinion and the opinion of many political appointees, including
                    people at the very top...the seventh floor of the State Department [the very top
                    officials, the Secretary, the Under Secretary, etc.], the NSC and the White
                    House, the State Department does not do two functions well. Those are
                    Congressional relations and public affairs. One of the reasons is that the
                    people who go into the State Department like to deal with foreign countries.
                    They don't join the Foreign Service to work on Capitol Hill or to deal with the
                    media. So positions in H, the Bureau for Congressional Relations, or PA, Bureau
                    for Public Affairs, were areas not considered to be fast track areas.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>I think that is a terrible mistake because I think it makes the job of the
                    Secretary of State and everybody under him that more difficult. Historically,
                    the American people have not been very foreign-oriented, quite the contrary.
                    Ever since George Washington warned us about getting involved in foreign
                    entanglements, I think the orientation has been more toward domestic issues
                    rather than foreign affairs. So you have to convince people that there is a
                    reason why you are involved in foreign affairs. We, the US government, haven't
                    done that very well, historically. So that is one of the reasons that the Office
                    of Public Diplomacy was created—to put out as much information as possible.</p>
                <p>I was referring tongue-in-cheek to the truth because most people, of course, on
                    all sides of an issue, including the recently departed Soviet Politburo, think
                    they are telling the truth. The way we approached it was that we had an enormous
                    amount of classified information that supported what we were saying in public.
                    First let me say that what we were saying in public was a lot less than what I
                    thought we should be saying, because the Department also has the tendency to be
                    a bit elitist and to figure, “Look, you are paying us to conduct our nation's
                    foreign policy, so trust me.”</p>
                <p>Well, you know, nobody trusts anybody any more for anything...not that anyone
                    ever did. But you have an additional problem now that the press and the Congress
                    have become very adversarial in their roles vis-a-vis the Executive Branch, as a
                    result of Vietnam and Watergate, primarily. First we weren't saying enough.
                    Secondly, people didn't think we were telling the truth. Thirdly, we had an
                    enormous amount of information which a lot of us felt that if we could
                    declassify it in a safe manner...protecting sources and methods by which it had
                    been gathered...would prove to the honest skeptics that we were telling the
                    truth. That is what I was referring to as the truth. That is what my office in a
                    nutshell tried to do and did for two and a half years.</p>
                <p>Successfully enough, too, because the State Department and the Administration
                    decided to establish similar offices of public diplomacy for other controversial
                    issues. South Africa was one. You recall we have what is called constructive
                    engagement, which I think with the benefit of hindsight can also be said to have
                    worked. In fact, I think the same can be said about most of our foreign policies
                    in the last 45 to 50 years. We were on the right side of history. A lot of
                    people didn't think so at the time, including, I am sorry to say, a lot of our
                    own people in the United States. But when the policy was given the opportunity
                    to play itself out—these things don't have a quick pay-off—then they have proven
                    to be correct. Central America, Latin America as a whole, meaning economic
                    policy, Southern Africa, Southeast and Southwest Asia, and, of course, the big
                    issue of the entire century, the victory over communism...or as I have been
                    pointing out to my friends, victories over Fascism, both Nazi and Communism,
                    over the last 75 years.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>In other words, as critical as I may sound, I do want to add here for the record,
                    I think the system has worked, not perfectly because it is not conducted by
                    perfect human beings, but in effect the United States did have, all things
                    considered, a pretty good record of foreign affairs, with some notable
                    flaws.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's look at our Central American policy. I can see two
                        major themes that had to be played. One was the nastiness of the
                        Sandinistas, both internally and their efforts to export the revolution. The
                        other theme was in El Salvador, and to a lesser extent, in Honduras and
                        Guatemala, the nastiness of elements within those governments. Every time
                        you turned around you were having death squads and assassinations. So you
                        had both of these going and, of course, one side of the Administration would
                        focus on the Sandinistas, while the critics of the policy would focus on the
                        right wing within El Salvador, etc. How did you deal with that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: You are right and that was part of the problem in that the issue was very,
                    very complex...I don't want to say that it was too complex for anyone to
                    understand, it wasn't that. The fact is that the problems of Central America
                    didn't just emerge in the 1970s and '80s; they had been building for four
                    hundred years. The complex social, political, economic, racial, ethnic,
                    cultural, historic and every other aspect of society that you can think of, all
                    of that was boiled down to the simplest possible of terms as you just said. One
                    side defending the Sandinistas and the other side attacking the Sandinistas.
                    That was very unfortunate. One side defending the Salvadoran government and the
                    other side attacking the Salvadoran government and by implication defending the
                    Marxist guerrillas in El Salvador. That was the unfortunate truth.</p>
                <p>That is one of the things that we had to deal with. But being in the
                    Administration and having been part of the policy formulation process and
                    implementing process, all of us who were in knew that the issue really wasn't
                    that simple. We had a policy that had basically four pillars and it was, in
                    fact, simplified down to four elements. A political, an economic, a military and
                    a diplomatic component. We called them the four Ds, so people could
                    remember—democracy, development, dialogue and defense. I didn't coin that. I
                    believe it was Luigi Einaudi, who was director of policy planning for the Bureau
                    for Inter-American Affairs at the time. When exactly he or his staff came up
                    with these four Ds, I don't know, but it was a very good way of defining what
                    our policy goals or instruments in this case, were.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>The democracy, the political element, meant that we were trying to help build
                    institutions of democracy which had either never existed or had been destroyed
                    in Central America over the last 150 years of independence. Through development,
                    the economic component, we were trying to help establish as equitable society as
                    a foreign power can possibly establish with limited resources in a convulsed
                    society, which is what Central America was at the time. Through dialogue, the
                    diplomatic component, we were trying to achieve these goals through, among other
                    things, diplomacy. Some of the criticssaid that it was nonsense, we were never
                    serious about diplomacy. That is not true. In fact, once again with the benefit
                    of hindsight, we can now say the proof is that when we had complete power to do
                    whatever we wanted in this region we chose the peaceful route. We could have
                    used military force, and, in fact, have used military force, say in Panama.
                    Panama, I think, can be the exception that proves the rule. We used military
                    force in Panama only when everything else had been exhausted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking about the invasion...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: ... of Panama in December, 1989 by US forces to arrest General Noriega and
                    restore the democratic government that had been elected six months previously in
                    an election and which had been annulled by General Noriega who was then the
                    self-appointed dictator of Panama and who, as we speak, is being tried for
                    narcotics trafficking in a US court in Miami.</p>
                <p>The fourth element was defense, the military component. That, as you mentioned,
                    is probably the one that got the most attention and got the people on both sides
                    of the issues most roiled up. That was because those people supporting the
                    policy were saying that if we did not have a military component to the policy
                    that the other side was going to continue the military buildup. The Soviets and
                    Cubans were involved. I hope there is no debate about that today. There is no
                    question they were involved...the Soviets have admitted it and, in fact, even
                    Castro has admitted it. Unfortunately, when you have some people using force you
                    have to use force yourself to defend your interests or those of your allies.</p>
                <p>Then the question is: who were your allies, why are you defending these terrible
                    people? The fact is that we were not defending these terrible people, we were
                    using every means at our disposal to help the democratic elements in Central
                    America...El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica. We were trying to help
                    the democratic elements clean up their act, in effect. Get rid of the despots,
                    get rid of the inequities through programs such as land reform, which I believe
                    we mentioned in the last section.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>And that was a very difficult debate to conduct because people tend to focus on
                    emotional things such as the assassination of nuns. Who can think of something
                    more despicable then killing nuns? Yet that is exactly what happened in December
                    1980 in El Salvador and it helped to color the debate. I can tell you nobody in
                    the Reagan or the Bush Administrations were ever going to defend that...in fact
                    it happened during the Carter Administration. We had nothing to do with that,
                    but we were put into the position of being associated with a government which
                    was accused, and I think to a large degree correctly, of not doing enough to
                    attack the causes of that kind of violence and to prosecute people
                    responsible.</p>
                <p>Another truth, though, was that there were equally despicable crimes on the other
                    side that never got any publicity. I know that because I was in El Salvador when
                    some of these things happened—assassinations, kidnapings, murders, maiming,
                    torture by both sides. It seemed to us that only the bad aspect of what was
                    happening would get attention if it were carried out by the so-called pro-US
                    forces and never the anti-US forces.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you are sitting in an office in Washington. How does
                        one work with this? Obviously you are reading the cables and the press and
                        all and consulting with people who were there visiting. How do you go about
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: What we decided to do was to go to the conduits of information, the media.
                    We decided to start working with honest reporters. We were not surprised to find
                    that most reporters were honest—though some were not. By that I mean some had an
                    ideological agenda, and many of them are still around. Some have crashed and
                    burned because they were found out to be dishonest. Those dishonest ones were
                    simply going out to try to find information that would support their point of
                    view. Fortunately there were others. If we couldn't work with the reporters, we
                    would go to the editors and say that these are some of the facts that your
                    reporters have overlooked and we happen to know that he or she has access to
                    them. In many cases that worked. Some of them were furious. In fact, I ended up
                    paying a political price for it.</p>
                <p>I told you earlier that I was told ahead of time I would. It was sort of kamikaze
                    mission in a way. I was told you don't take on the press in the United States
                    without paying a price and you don't take on the Congress without paying a
                    price. Yet, as I mentioned in the beginning of this talk, since we had decided
                    that Congressional relations and press relations were two things that the State
                    Department traditionally does not do well, that was my job. It was to, in
                    effect, engage the press and the Congress in a dialogue.</p>
                <p>Most of the people we dealt with in those two institutions responded positively.
                    Some did not because, I think, they had an ideological agenda which was opposed
                    to that Administration. Indeed, some for just plain partisan reasons did not
                    want the Reagan Administration to have a victory in Central America—I am
                    referring to some members of the Democratic Party who had run out of political
                    issues with which to attack the Administration.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>They had attacked Reaganomics, and Reaganomics had turned out to work in the
                    1980s...there were more people working than ever in the United States, inflation
                    was down, etc.</p>
                <p>They said that Reagan was a cowboy, a hard line anti-communist that was going to
                    get us into a war with the Soviet Union and the opposite happened. The Soviet
                    Union, with the advent of Gorbachev in March, 1985 started to pull back from its
                    foreign ventures and relations began to improve. So there were very few
                    political issues with which the political opponents in this democracy of ours
                    could attack the party in power to try to get back into power. Central America
                    was one of those issues and it became a partisan political issue.</p>
                <p>But most of the people with whom we dealt, I think, recognized that we were
                    trying to tell the truth. We declassified enormous amounts of information. We
                    worked with the intelligence community to try to declassify as much as we could
                    without damaging our sources or methods of collecting that information. We
                    provided this information to the press in a way that they could go on their own
                    to corroborate it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you deal with it? I mean you have two major
                        dynamos of power in the government on the press side—the New York Times and
                        the Washington Post. Everybody reads those in the morning and respond to
                        them that day. It often sets the government agenda. Could you talk about how
                        you dealt with these two?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: You are absolutely right, they set the agenda in many ways, particularly
                    the New York Times. We found that whatever was in the New York Times in the
                    morning, would be on the three networks in the evening. The networks always
                    tried to “advance” the morning news in the evening. The New York Times has an
                    enormous influence. I think perhaps a little less today than it did back then
                    because it has reacted to some of the excesses. The New York Times was highly
                    ideological in what it printed at that time. Particularly the editorial page of
                    the New York Times. But, even the news department.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>For example, there was a reporter by the name of Raymond Bonner, who the New York
                    Times sent to El Salvador and who was very much ideologically in favor of the
                    Salvadoran guerrillas and opposed to the Administration. He wrote story after
                    story which was partially false. It wasn't one big lie. For example, the story
                    about the land reform and how it wasn't working. Our American Ambassador there,
                    Dean Hinton, a career Foreign Service Officer who today is one of the five top
                    people who have the highest rank in the State Department, took the unusual step
                    of calling a press conference to denounce this one story. He pointed out 22
                    factual errors in this medium-sized story by this reporter. This is the same
                    reporter, for example, [I mention again the New York Times because it is so
                    important because a lot of times what is in the New York Times is assumed to be
                    the truth until proven otherwise] who in January 1982 had a story that a couple
                    of US Green Berets [we had 55 advisers in Salvador at the time by mutual
                    agreement with Congress] had been present at a torture session where two
                    Salvadorans teenagers, a boy and a girl, had been tortured to death. You can
                    imagine the graphic description of this and the revulsion on the part of
                    everyone who read this story. Bonner based this story...I mention his name
                    because I think institutions like the New York Times have a responsibility to
                    make sure that this kind of thing never happens again. This man used the New
                    York Times. He was removed by the New York Times months later after he had a
                    terrible impact on the image of the United States and the policy we were trying
                    to carry out. Bonner based this story on the testimony of one man...which, by
                    the way, is a violation of the New York Times' own rules; you are supposed to
                    have two sources at a minimum...one man who claimed to have been a defector from
                    the Salvador guerrillas who emerged in Mexico City and was presented to the New
                    York Times by the Salvadoran guerrilla office. By the way, the New York Times
                    investigated Bonner because the Pentagon, to its credit, immediately conducted
                    an investigation, found out that this story was absolutely false, interviewed
                    every single person who had been in the US armed forces in El Salvador any time
                    near the date that this horrible incident was supposed to have happened. They
                    even conducted this investigation worldwide because some of the military
                    advisors had already left El Salvador and gone on to other assignments. They
                    found out that the accusation was not true.</p>
                <p>The New York Times did retract the story eventually but, in my opinion, in a
                    cowardly way. They did not say that they were wrong. They had a very long
                    explanation as to why the story should never have run because it didn't have
                    corroborating sources, etc., etc. The fact it was totally false, we know from
                    our work with the intelligence community. The Cubans had surfaced this story six
                    months before, but it was so crude that nobody picked it up. They looked for a
                    sympathetic reporter. Raymond Bonner was it. I have told him this to his face. I
                    have debated him.</p>
                <p>Interestingly, I debated him one time in 1983 in Los Angeles before a very
                    liberal Hollywood audience. He was attacking the Administration policy and I was
                    defending it. That Hollywood audience actually turned around and supported me.
                    They could tell something was wrong with that guy's stories.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>That is one example. I mention this because one little story in one news
                    organization took months, and probably thousands of dollars, in investigation by
                    our government. I was very disappointed by the behavior of the New York Times
                    during that period. A lot of the people at the time were convinced that we were
                    wrong and they were right. They did not want to publish any information which
                    supported the Administration's viewpoint.</p>
                <p>For example, human rights violations in Nicaragua. There was a major defection by
                    the head of the Sandinistas' own human rights organization, which had been
                    established to cover up their own human rights violations and highlight the
                    alleged violations [I think some did take place] by the Contras. This man was so
                    fed up with the lies he was being forced to put out by the Sandinista government
                    that he defected. We made a mistake. We thought that this guy was so important
                    and the New York Times so important that we gave it an exclusive.</p>
                <p>A Pulitzer Prize winning reporter, Shirley Christian, interviewed him for hours
                    and wrote a 2,000 word story of which the New York Times published only four
                    tiny paragraphs, of which three paragraphs were the Sandinista government's
                    rebuttal of what this man had to say.</p>
                <p>That to me is dishonest journalism. I hope one day someone writes a book—I don't
                    have the patience to do it—about the dishonesty of the American media in the
                    1980s in reporting on Central America.</p>
                <p>I can give you stories of a Newsday reporter who was opposed to the
                    Administration; he came to us over a period of months looking for information;
                    we gave him information and he finally goes to Central America and comes back
                    and says, “I was wrong. I think the Administration's policy is basically right.”
                    He wrote a story and it was killed by the editors at Newsday. They did not want
                    to hear that. They wanted to hear that the Administration was wrong. I can tell
                    you many other such stories.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Faced with this, did you have other ways of working?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: Yes, we had to go directly to the people. We put out a constant stream of
                    what are called “white papers,” which we used to brief the Congress.
                    Interestingly a lot of Congressmen would tell us privately, “We know you are
                    telling us the truth, but I just can't support you because I have all these
                    crazies in my district.” The churches went crazy over this thing. They were
                    manipulated, I think, by political activists—The National Council of Churches
                    and some of the others. I think they are now paying a price for it. They are
                    losing membership...they never should have gotten involved in political issues
                    in the first place and secondly, they should have been honest about it. But,
                    once again, they fell into this morass of wanting to support a particular
                    viewpoint and being forced to fudge some of the issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel you were fighting Vietnam all over?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: Oh, absolutely. I was in the army during the time of Vietnam, in Panama.
                    But I feel, like most of our colleagues in the government, that this was a lot
                    like Vietnam. In fact, I will quote you someone who I think is a dedicated
                    public servant, who unfortunately later on got into all kinds of trouble—Bud
                    McFarlane. McFarlane was the head of the NSC at the time I was...actually I
                    worked with a couple of different NSC directors, three, as a matter of fact.
                    First there was Judge Clark, then McFarlane and then Poindexter. Poindexter came
                    in just before I left for Venezuela so I didn't work with him very closely. One
                    day when I was in reporting at an NSC meeting towards the end of my tenure (I
                    reported to the NSC periodically although, the line of my reporting was to the
                    Secretary of State) McFarlane, who had been a combat officer in Vietnam, said
                    some very nice things about the work of my office. He said something like,
                    “Well, Otto won the Vietnam all over again.” What he meant was that we should
                    have done something like my public diplomacy effort in Vietnam. Of course,
                    Vietnam was a much bigger thing. I think, once again, that there (Vietnam), and
                    I feel strongly about this, that the US media did play a role. They opposed the
                    war and set out to end it. Unfortunately, it ended in a way that cost the lives
                    of hundred of thousands of Vietnamese, Cambodians and others after the victory
                    of the communists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happens now? You got this, you are telling the truth
                        and all of a sudden something really nasty, you can always be sure that a
                        death squad will come up with something nasty in El Salvador. The death
                        squads were to the right of our policy. What did you do...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: Let me say something. The death squads were very much opposed to our
                    policy and we were very much opposed to them. However, we felt very much in the
                    middle of this war. We had these right wing fanatics on the right and these left
                    wing fanatics on the left. They were equally violent, equally destructive on an
                    individual basis. But in the case of El Salvador, they were more numerous on the
                    left and we felt that they had to be reduced in numbers, which is why we had the
                    military component of the policy. On the right they were smaller in numbers, but
                    more powerful politically because they did have connections with the economic
                    elites, political elites and military elites of the country. We fought very hard
                    against both of them.</p>
                <p>I have many proud moments. I remember one time briefing some people who happened
                    to be very charming individuals but who had to be described as right wing
                    Salvadorans. I mean, the people who would have been very happy to have had the
                    right wing death squads, let's say, win. I remember we showed them our four Ds
                    and what we were trying to do. One older gentleman turned to a younger one at
                    his side and said, “With friends like this who needs enemies?” He said this in
                    English. They were very unhappy with a balanced US policy, which was just fine
                    with us. We weren't doing this to please the right or the left or anybody. We
                    were genuinely trying to find a peaceful end to the war and to find a way to
                    deal with the basic underlying causes of poverty and injustice and
                    underdevelopment in Central America.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>I feel that we did the best we could with limited resources. We spent billions of
                    dollars, lost the lives of fine young men in Central America...military and
                    labor advisers...Mike Hammer, who was a friend of mine. I knew Mike Hammer
                    because I used to work closely with the American Institute for Free Labor
                    Development (AIFLD) when I ran the Washington office of the Council of the
                    Americas...the Council of the Americas, in effect, is the business counterpart
                    of the American Institute for Free Labor Development and although they have some
                    policy disagreements I had very close relations with Bill Doherty, still do, who
                    is the head of AIFLD, of which Mike Hammer who was killed in Salvador along with
                    another American and a Salvadoran in January 1981, was a part.</p>
                <p>People like that are the ones, frankly, who deserve the credit for what I think
                    will soon be the end of the Salvadoran civil war. Just today, September 24,
                    1991, the newspapers have stories that both sides are predicting an imminent end
                    to hostilities in El Salvador. Of course, we have been hearing this for a long
                    time, but I think with the demise of communism, the final cutoff of external
                    assistance to the Salvadoran guerrillas, they have been forced to negotiate in
                    good faith. And the government of El Salvador is also different because it
                    doesn't have the pressures from the right. We have succeeded in many ways in
                    convincing the right and left that they were not going to win. They were not
                    going to turn Salvador into an ash heap and start from scratch.</p>
                <p>The irony is that these extremists, and I equate them, were so similar that they
                    almost use the same terminology. Both the left and the right said that they
                    wouldn't mind starting from ashes if that is what it took to defeat the other
                    side. Well, we were not willing to allow that and we were convinced that the
                    vast majority of Salvadoran people did not want that. The evidence for that is
                    that when the Salvadoran people had an opportunity to express themselves, as in
                    the elections, they came out in huge numbers. They braved death. Many of them
                    were killed by the guerrillas standing in line to vote. The right wing never
                    attacked, to my knowledge, any voting booths and the left did because the left
                    did not want it shown that they really didn't have popular support...and they
                    don't have popular support.</p>
                <p>Most of the population, just like most peasants anywhere in the world, want to be
                    left alone. They don't want the government on their back; they don't want the
                    landowner on their back; they want a piece of land to work and a better future
                    for their children. They felt that US policy gave them their best hope.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we turn to Venezuela, one last question. The
                        Iran-Contra affairs has become a major thing within our political life. Was
                        this going on during your time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>REICH: No, this happened after. However, I was drawn in because of my actions
                    prior to going to Venezuela. All of that happened quite a while after I left. I
                    left that office in January, 1986 and, as you recall, the Iran-Contra affair
                    really broke in November, 1986. I have to tell you that when it did happen I was
                    as surprised as anyone because I had worked with Ollie North almost on a daily
                    basis. We were trying to get information declassified and since he was at the
                    NSC and dealing with the intelligence community, lots of times he would support
                    our request. He was involved in public diplomacy because he realized we needed
                    more public support for the United States. But I have to admit that some of the
                    actions that have come to light since then were as much a surprise to me as they
                    were to most everybody. The people who he was working with on that side like the
                    Hakims, the Secords, none of us knew. These were people who had been in the
                    government and made contacts, but were at that time outside government. The
                    things they got in trouble for doing they did outside the government. If you
                    recall there were very few people who have actually gotten into trouble for
                    anything they have done inside the government. Poindexter, I suppose, but I
                    think Poindexter, like North, is probably going to be exonerated...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not exonerated but...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: Well, they are now trying, frankly in my opinion, to invent charges.
                    Walsh, the special prosecutor, has failed. He was supposed to find out if there
                    was any wrong doing in the aid to the Contras or the shipment of arms to Iran.
                    He is now off on totally different subjects.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's move to Venezuela. How did you get your appointment
                        to be Ambassador to Venezuela? You served there from 1986-89.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: I was not anxious to go overseas, and when I had gone into the government
                    in 1981 I really thought it was going to be a short-term assignment. I was very
                    happy to have gotten the assignment in AID. It was right up my alley with my
                    economic development background. When I took on the Public Diplomacy assignment
                    it brought me into contact with a lot more people at much higher levels in the
                    State Department and in the White House.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>Since I was doing a lot of public speaking, etc., in the fall of 1984 I was asked
                    to be part of something called the White House Surrogate Speakers Program.
                    Because of the election coming up, the President and the Vice President and
                    Cabinet Secretaries were getting so many speaking requests from around the
                    country, in addition to what they normally have, that they just couldn't be met.
                    So the White House Public Affairs Office set up a stable of Administration
                    officials who could be called upon to go and speak around the country on
                    different issues. Central America was a very controversial issue even then. So I
                    gave a lot of those speeches to groups around the country.Shortly after the
                    election of 1984, I was invited over to the Office of Presidential Personnel,
                    where I was asked, to my surprise, if I would be interested in being an
                    ambassador. I said that I hadn't thought about it very much. Frankly, to tell
                    you the truth, of course I had thought about it, but as something for much later
                    in my career. Since I had only been in the Public Diplomacy job a little over a
                    year, I didn't feel I had finished that job. In fact, we were right in the
                    middle of this tremendous public battle on the policy. But I was very flattered.
                    They mentioned a couple of countries which were attractive to me, although
                    relatively small—medium size embassies in Latin America. I said, “Thanks, but
                    no.” I had some personal considerations, my kids. I didn't think I wanted to
                    take my kids overseas at such a young age, etc.</p>
                <p>At any rate, time passed and early in 1985 they called again and mentioned two
                    other countries. I turned them down for the same reason. I became rather worried
                    because you can't keep turning this down too long or they will think you're just
                    not interested. The third time they called they asked if I wanted to be
                    ambassador to Panama to replace Ted Briggs, a friend of mine, who was also born
                    in Havana, Cuba as a matter of fact. I said, “Yes.” God must have been watching
                    over me, or one of my guardian angels or something, because as the process was
                    about to begin...it is a very long process, of getting confirmed, (and it is
                    getting worse)..George Landau, career ambassador who was in Caracas, [talking
                    spring, 1985 now] decided to retire early and just about immediately because he
                    was offered a very good job as President of the Council of the Americas in New
                    York. This was in April/May and he was to leave in June, thus leaving an
                    unexpected vacancy in a very important post.</p>
                <p>I got a call, this time from State, asking if I would rather go to Venezuela than
                    Panama. Of course, Venezuela is a huge country and frankly, I was a little
                    concerned about Panama simply because I had so many friends there. I thought
                    that was not a good idea to go to a place where you have so many friends because
                    familiarity breeds contempt and they might ask a lot of favors on visas, etc. So
                    I felt I would rather keep my friends and be ambassador elsewhere.</p>
                <p>Venezuela was one of only two countries in the entire hemisphere that I had never
                    visited—the other was Bolivia. So when Venezuela came up, I accepted. Also, Ted
                    Briggs was not supposed to leave Panama for almost the rest of the year. So that
                    is how Venezuela came up.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>I had the advantage of being supported for that position by both State and the
                    White House. You know the process where State comes up with a candidate, and
                    State did come up with a candidate, but I think sort of halfheartedly, because
                    Secretary Shultz supported my candidacy.</p>
                <p>In fact there is a little anecdote that was left out here. In the spring of 1985
                    I was working in my office late one afternoon and my secretary says “The
                    Secretary wants to see you.” I said, “The secretary of what.” She said, “THE
                    Secretary.” I said, “Oh, Secretary Shultz. I am either going to get a promotion
                    or get fired.” In my job I was quite controversial. Fortunately I had a lot of
                    supporters. In fact, I have to say that we had gained the support of a lot of
                    people who had been skeptical in the State Department. The State Department did
                    not want the creation of my office because it was almost a slap in the face—”you
                    really don't do these jobs right so we are going to get this outsider to do
                    them”. But after slightly less than two years, I really did have the support of
                    the Department and was getting along fine with everybody. So I jokingly said
                    that I was either going to get fired or promoted.</p>
                <p>In fact it was a promotion. Secretary Shultz told me that he wanted me to be his
                    Assistant Secretary for Human Rights. He wanted to announce this the next
                    morning. It really took me completely by surprise. You can keep secrets in the
                    State Department and this was kept from me. I was once again very flattered, but
                    I did not think that my temperament was the right one for that particular job. I
                    told the Secretary and said that I would have to talk to my wife. He said that
                    he was not offering the job to my wife but to me. He was joking, but I turned it
                    down.</p>
                <p>I later had the opportunity to tell him that I was being considered for an
                    ambassadorship and would like his support. He said, “Which one?” And I said,
                    “Venezuela.” He, as Shultz usually did, said nothing but nodded yes. So I
                    figured I had his support, and I did.</p>
                <p>So I was nominated. Ran into some nomination problems from both the right and the
                    left, which made me feel good. Senator Helms opposed my nomination because of my
                    support for land reform in El Salvador and the Panama Treaties. One left-wing
                    group, for ideological reasons said I was too conservative to be an ambassador.
                    But I was unanimously confirmed after Senator Lugar saved my nomination from
                    oblivion by pulling it out of the jurisdiction of the subcommittee and holding
                    hearings on it himself.</p>
                <p>I had an opportunity yesterday to thank him again. I was at a lunch with the
                    President of Venezuela who was in Washington and the three of us were talking.
                    President Perez had just given a little talk at the Center for Strategic
                    International Studies, where I am also involved. He had mentioned the importance
                    of Congress in US-Latin American relations. I said, “Mr. President, here is an
                    example of how important Congress is. Here is the man who you have to blame for
                    my being named as Ambassador to Venezuela....” And, of course, they both
                    laughed.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>But Senator Lugar held the hearings and I was confirmed. Senator Helms had a lot
                    of questions which I mentioned earlier. When we answered them he accepted them.
                    Even he voted for me. I went off to Venezuela in May, 1986.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any prepping for going to Venezuela from the
                        State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: Yes, I had a little more time than others. Because I had been opposed (by
                    a Senator) and my nomination had been derailed for a while...this is a very
                    unusual nomination I have to say. Then the nomination papers took forever. I was
                    selected by the White House and the State Department about May, 1985. George
                    Landau left Caracas in June, 1985. My papers started moving through the White
                    House...the first paper required is for the President to indicate intention to
                    nominate. That begins the FBI process, the IRS and all that stuff...later on
                    leading to the nomination, followed by the notification to the Senate, the
                    confirmation on the Hill, etc. That should take four or five months. In my case
                    it took eleven months. So I had a lot of time to prepare.</p>
                <p>If you are interested in why it took eleven months...I told you that I was
                    opposed by different groups. And the nomination of an American Ambassador to a
                    Latin American country is a very big deal in that country. It is front page
                    news. Unfortunately, the first news that came out of Washington, before my
                    nomination was even known in the State Department...somebody leaked it to this
                    left wing group here in Washington that opposed all Administrations, Democratic
                    as well as Republican...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you name it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: Yes, it is called the Council of Hemispheric Affairs. It is basically a
                    phony organization; it is one guy called Larry Birns who has nothing else to do.
                    I understand he is wealthy and this is his hobby, to create problems. He goes
                    around town being ridiculous...and I do mean ridiculous...he is sort of a clown.
                    But he puts out these press releases and a lot of the Latin American press pick
                    them up, they don't know him...one of the press releases read something like
                    “Right wing extremist being named as Ambassador to Venezuela.”</p>
                <p>Well the Venezuelan press picked this up, didn't check it and printed almost
                    verbatim what this nut, Larry Birns, published, saying that I was being sent to
                    Venezuela to put pressure on the Venezuelan government... Birns knows how to
                    manipulate information very, very well. So this was a big scandal in Venezuela.
                    Front page news. Because of that reaction the State Department decided to let
                    things calm down.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>The Venezuelans made a mistake. They sent their Ambassador here to inquire if
                    indeed it was going to nominate this Otto Reich, and if so, why? The Deputy
                    Secretary, John Whitehead, received the Ambassador. He said that there had been
                    no announcement, but he could assure his government that whomever the US
                    Ambassador was going to be, would have the full confidence of the President and
                    the Government of the United States. He would be fully qualified. Without
                    confirming or denying any names, however, he wanted to know why the Ambassador
                    would object to Mr. Reich? The Ambassador said, “Because he wasn't born in the
                    United States.” Whitehead asked what that had to do with anything. The
                    Venezuelan replied “We believe that an ambassador should be born in the country
                    being represented”. They had no real reason to object to me, so they picked on
                    that one, which is very silly. Here is a country where everybody is treated
                    equally...Henry Kissinger still speaks with an accent. Whitehead just shook his
                    head. I heard later from people who were in the meeting that Whitehead said
                    words to the effect of: “You don't understand the United States. National
                    origin, race or sex doesn't matter to us. Yes, we have had some cases in the
                    past when we haven't been as equitable as we should have been, but we are
                    working very hard to overcome that. In fact, no matter where this person was
                    born, he or she will be completely qualified.” He reminded him about a
                    German-born Secretary of State and a Polish-born National Security Adviser. He
                    said, “At this time I couldn't tell you how many of our present ambassadors were
                    born outside the United States. I know several were, but it doesn't matter to
                    us.”</p>
                <p>The Venezuelan was quite embarrassed by this whole episode because the episode
                    was leaked to the press in Venezuela. I think they realized they had made a
                    mistake. Later, Secretary Shultz had a meeting with the Venezuelan President in
                    New York, at the time of the General Assembly, during which he confirmed that we
                    intended to nominate Otto Reich. The Venezuelan President said that was fine.
                    Several people had gotten to them and pointed out that they were reacting to
                    vicious information which was untrue. They realized it, did their own check and
                    were embarrassed.</p>
                <p>As a result, I arrived in Venezuela a year later...I was first selected in May,
                    1985; President Reagan signed the papers for me in August, he should have signed
                    it before but, if you recall, in the summer of 1985 he got cancer of the colon,
                    which put all routine paperwork on hold...finally when the above incident
                    happened they figured they had better move this thing forward...they initiated
                    the process, but it was put on hold by Whitehead who was upset by the
                    Venezuelans. He wanted them to “stew in their own juices” for a while. The FBI
                    process began in the fall and was finished by December. Then there was the
                    Christmas vacation and I was nominated in January. Then Senator Helms decided to
                    ignore my nomination for a couple of months. In about March of 86, Senator Lugar
                    pulled it and had hearings in April. I was confirmed in April and left in May,
                    arriving eleven months after the departure of the previous ambassador.</p>
                <p>As a result of the Venezuelan overreaction...I think it benefitted me because
                    they received me, I think, much more positively, warmly than they would have
                    another American Ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went out there what was America's interest in
                        Venezuela and did you have any set agenda?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: Sure. First, Venezuela is our first or second, depending on trade numbers
                    for that particular year, trading partner in South America. Our number one
                    trading partner in Latin America is Mexico. So Venezuela was very important from
                    an economic standpoint.</p>
                <p>Also, politically they have always exerted a very strong influence in large part
                    due to their economic power. This is the country that had the highest per capita
                    income in Latin America. With a surplus of petro-dollars in the '70s and '80s as
                    a result of the oil crisis, they put their money where their mouth is—supporting
                    democracy. They have the second longest record of democratic government in South
                    America. After Costa Rica, Venezuela with the overthrow of the Perez Jimenez
                    dictatorship in 1958 has now had, today, 33 years of democracy, which is a good
                    record.</p>
                <p>We saw and still see Venezuela as a very important player in regional issues and
                    in support of democracy which was our goal in Central America. They had been
                    working independently of us to support the same governments...the Christian
                    Democratic governments in Latin America—the Duarte government, the Christian
                    Democratic government in Guatemala which was trying to gain power through
                    elections, the Democrats in Costa Rica, Honduras or Nicaragua. They did not
                    support the Sandinistas after the first few months. They were very disappointed
                    with the Sandinistas, as we were.</p>
                <p>Our relations with Venezuela were very good. If anything, I wanted to try to
                    improve them and bring the two countries closer together. I wanted to keep the
                    flow of oil open to the United States. There is not a whole lot an ambassador
                    can do on that issue, frankly, because it depends on world conditions, prices,
                    etc. But I wanted to have closer scientific and technical and business ties, if
                    possible.</p>
                <p>Venezuela was beginning to be used by the Colombian narcotic traffickers as a
                    transshipment point and money-laundering site. Venezuela produces hardly
                    anything narcotics. There is a mountain range on the border with Colombia where
                    you can grow Marijuana, but they have all the coca paste they need coming from
                    Bolivia, Peru, etc.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>We had a lot of different agendas but no one big issue which dominated our
                    relations. Frankly, that is one of the reasons why I like Venezuela so much. For
                    instance, in Panama it would have been the canal; in Salvador would have been
                    land reform and the guerrilla war; in Colombia would have been narcotics. I was
                    very glad not to go to a one-issue country because this gave me an opportunity
                    to deal with everything from agriculture, to trade, defense, cultural issues...
                    I got to know a lot about specific trade problems. We also worked with Venezuela
                    on political issues for Central America—and on help for Haiti in trying to move
                    it towards democratic elections, etc.</p>
                <p>At the same time we had differences of opinion, for example, on Puerto Rico. I
                    was commended by the State Department for that issue. The Venezuelans had
                    decided to change their vote on Puerto Rico in the United Nations from
                    co-sponsorship of a Cuban resolution for the independence of Puerto Rico to
                    abstention, which took the wind out of the sails of the Cuban resolution, and it
                    subsequently failed.</p>
                <p>So we had a lot of issues to work on. We worked very closely with them to promote
                    human rights in the hemisphere. It was a good period. At the same time, however,
                    it was a declining economic period for Venezuela. A lot of my time was taken up
                    working on issues related to the external debt. They had the fourth largest debt
                    in Latin America, although it was relatively manageable, by Latin American
                    standards, because of the large amount of money that oil brings into Venezuela.
                    But I had a lot of negotiations with their Ministry of Finance people, and our
                    Treasury Department. I was constantly being visited by the negotiators for the
                    private banks. We managed to provide assistance to Venezuela at some very
                    important times for them. They simply ran out of money one time and we provided
                    them with a “bridge” loan, for which they were very grateful. We felt it was
                    very much in our interest because the stability of that country was very
                    important to us.</p>
                <p>They have gotten back on their feet. I am glad to say that one of the things that
                    I did when I got there was, as is my custom, to start talking. I gave a lot of
                    speeches about democracy and human rights, about private enterprise and the
                    market economy, because Venezuela had a very protected economy and a very
                    inefficient economy. There was a huge state sector of the economy.</p>
                <p>Consequently, I was accused of interfering in Venezuelan affairs. The Communist
                    Party had a little newspaper that attacked me for interfering in Venezuelan
                    affairs. But the Communist Party is insignificant in Venezuela, in fact, it is
                    not even a party anymore because it did not get the necessary one-half of one
                    percent that you have to get in an election (of 1988) to qualify. On the other
                    side, there were some very powerful industrialists who objected to my talking
                    about opening up, liberalizing the economy, reducing trade barriers and saying
                    that the consumer would benefit. They had become very wealthy behind these
                    protectionist barriers.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>Five years later all of that which I was calling for has happened. Not because I
                    was calling for it, but because it was logical. President Perez, the current
                    President, has undertaken very radical economic reforms and Venezuela is
                    benefitting as a result.</p>
                <p>On the personal front, I was very happy; my family was very happy and well
                    received. We had a beautiful house, courtesy of the American taxpayer. The
                    Ambassador's residence in Caracas is, I think, one of the nicest residences
                    anyway. It is not a palace, or a mansion, like some of our others, but a very
                    pleasant house in a very pleasant country. I would not trade those three years
                    for anything. In fact, I might want to do it again sometime in another place.
                    But not for a long time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you encourage American businessmen to come
                        in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: I tried different ways. I remember shortly after I arrived the Venezuelan
                    government, through several of its investment and trade promotion agencies, had
                    some kind of show or seminar in New York. I volunteered to write a letter that
                    would go with the trade promotion materials saying something like, “As the
                    American Ambassador, I would like to invite US companies to consider Venezuela
                    as a place to invest. The Venezuelans welcome it and it is good for both our
                    countries. Please come look at the opportunities.” The Venezuelans were
                    astounded. They thought it was wonderful that I was willing to do this. In fact,
                    one of the things that they always say to me when I come back to Venezuela is
                    that I was really concerned about their development and did a lot for them.</p>
                <p>I would do the same whenever I came back to the States...one of my little
                    self-imposed rules was to come back as often as I could, as I think the
                    Department should see your face in addition to your name on cables. So I took
                    about 15 trips back to the US in those three years. I would have taken more if I
                    could have. Whenever I could I would give speeches in New York, Washington or
                    Miami, at places of logical interest in Latin America—the Council of the
                    Americas, the Florida Governors Conference on World Trade, various chambers of
                    commerce. I had to turn down a number of requests because there was no State
                    Department money to get me out to the West Coast and other places a distance
                    from Washington. I would try to combine personal and official travel. If I was
                    going to be somewhere on vacation I would try to give a speech in the area.</p>
                <p>So, I gave a lot of talks and talked to a lot of business people. Frankly, I was
                    concerned because I believed there were very good opportunities in Venezuela and
                    that American companies were not taking advantage of them, and European and
                    Asian companies were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It has always been a dilemma that we don't deliberately
                        sponsor a company to do something.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>REICH: No, we don't. It is difficult because we have so many companies and often
                    you would run into a problem of competition. I had many cases where I had more
                    than one American company vying for a contract to a project, I helped all of
                    them. I remember when Sikorsky and Bell Helicopter were both going after the
                    same Air Force contract, and I helped them both. Neither one of them got it, the
                    French got it (through unfair trading practices). That was one example where you
                    could help two American companies.</p>
                <p>There were many other cases when I was down to one. I remember Bowater, a paper
                    manufacturer, and Guy F. Atkinson (a San Francisco based construction firm) had
                    joined together to build a $600 million paper pulp plant in Venezuela. They were
                    vying against a Norwegian consortium and a Canadian consortium but we won.</p>
                <p>What I did, and for which I am proud, was to tell my commercial counselor to let
                    me know of any opportunity in which I could get involved. I had a very good
                    commercial counselor Kenneth Moorefield, a West Point graduate, a decorated
                    combat Vietnam veteran (Silver Star, Purple Heart) —who is now
                    Minister-Counselor for Commercial Affairs in our embassy in London. He would
                    come up and say, “Mr. Ambassador, we have this company that has this problem.”
                    And I would say, “Let's go.” I would call the Venezuelan Minister involved and
                    go see him with a representative of the company. I have letters where senior
                    management of a company would write to the Secretary of State or Secretary of
                    Commerce or the President saying, “In my 35 years of doing business overseas, I
                    have never encountered an American embassy which has been this helpful to
                    American business.” That was great, and I circulated such letters throughout the
                    Embassy to thank them for their help.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the staff of the Embassy? One is often
                        told that some of them have been in Latin America too long, etc.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: No, I didn't find that. First of all, I happen to believe in
                    specialization. I know that Henry Kissinger doesn't and he caused this
                    hullabaloo when he moved people around. In fact, it is alleged that he was in
                    Panama being briefed on the Panama Canal back in the early '70s and he asked a
                    question that had to do with the Suez Canal—”How does this compare with the Suez
                    crisis?”—and there was no one who knew anything about the Suez Canal situation.
                    So he said the Department needed more cross-geographic assignments.</p>
                <p>

                        same thing. He found that there were people traveling with him who really
                        didn't know anything about Latin America and he got so upset about
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>REICH: I don't have a problem with that. I would rather have people who know the
                    Latin American culture and the language and can work in the field. I did have
                    some people who came in, for example, from Europe or other parts, who had
                    trouble adjusting to the Latin American culture. It takes a while. You can not
                    have been in the EUR Bureau all your life and all of a sudden parachute into
                    Caracas and expect that it is going to be the same as dealing with the Germans
                    or the Dutch, or vice versa. I do believe that people should get exposure to
                    more than one area of the world, but I don't have a problem with
                    specialization.</p>
                <p>My problem, I guess, is that the quality of the staff tends to be very uneven.
                    You have what we used to call “water walkers”, very good people. You also have
                    mediocre people and you have people in between. I don't think you have many bad
                    people in the Service. I do have to admit we had a few that had managed to fall
                    through the cracks and survive by doing the bare minimum. But I was blessed with
                    a fantastic DCM, Jeff Davidow, who later became the Ambassador to Zambia and is
                    now the principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for African Affairs. He is one of
                    the bright young (in his '40s) stars in the Foreign Service. Jeff was so good
                    with people and with the system that he was able to help us manage the Embassy
                    and overcome the problem of unevenness of the quality of the staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any political issues, such as Cuba that
                        occupied your time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: Oh, very much so, because Venezuela was very active in the Contadora Group
                    of countries (Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia and Panama), which was a group that
                    was established in 1983 to come up with a Latin American solution to the Central
                    America problem. But there were hidden agendas. Some were trying to keep the US
                    out of the region. We battled with them over Central America and we worked with
                    them in Central America.</p>
                <p>I remember five weeks after arriving in the country, the Venezuelan Ambassador to
                    the UN gave a speech which, in the opinion of our State Department, was a
                    gratuitous anti-US speech. Very unusual for Venezuela. But I received direct
                    instructions to go in and protest. Of course, I enjoyed that. My first protest,
                    first demarche. In fact I got the word as I was making my courtesy calls—I was
                    in Maracaibo, which is the second city in the country. I got a call from my
                    office in Caracas saying that the Assistant Secretary, Elliott Abrams, wanted to
                    talk to me. He did this over an open phone to make sure everybody was listening.
                    He said that this was a gratuitous anti-American speech and he wanted me to go
                    in and tell them that we didn't appreciate it.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>I got a copy of the speech and it was one of those things that Latin American
                    countries do in front of other Latin American countries to show that they are
                    independent from the United States. But we didn't like it and had every right
                    not to like it. So I went in and told the Foreign Minister, “Mr. Minister you
                    know I am not a career diplomat so if I say something in a way that is not the
                    way a diplomat would do, I hope you will forgive me.” Then I proceeded to just
                    blast them, nicely. He defended himself very well. But he was very
                    uncomfortable, I could tell. He said, “Why are you doing this? Nobody pays
                    attention to what anyone says in the United Nations.” I said, “Obviously that is
                    not always the case because somebody was listening. You can't just say those
                    things in the UN and expect that nobody is going to listen. Every speech that is
                    given is copied and circulated throughout our government and it is read not only
                    by the State Department but the NSC and the White House.” (I exaggerated little,
                    but it was for a good cause). We never had any trouble like that again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Cuba? How did they feel about Cuba?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: Well, I was dealing at that time with a government that was much more
                    sympathetic to our views, the Lusinchi Administration. Venezuelans are not
                    pro-Castro, but they love to find an issue with which they can differ with the
                    US. Cuba provides them with such an issue. They know that Castro is a dictator.
                    And they know that he has destroyed Cuba. But they don't like to see the US
                    wielding a big stick. So they claim there are other ways of promoting democracy
                    in Cuba.</p>
                <p>There are times, for example, in the UN and other fora where they find a reason
                    to oppose a US resolution. So, yes, Cuba was an issue over which we had some
                    differences. But not serious differences, because President Lusinchi was very
                    much anti-Castro. In fact, Venezuela had been a target of Castro's subversion
                    back in the '60s and there were many military who remember how many Venezuelans
                    died at he hands of Castro-supported guerrillas. But their public position
                    sometimes differed from the private one.</p>
                <p>I was a very public ambassador, I like to do all the public stuff which I think
                    is the ambassador's job. I also like to manage, but since I had such a good DCM,
                    he really was Mr. Inside and I was Mr. Outside, although we both had to spell
                    each other quite a bit in those roles. But I did a lot of public appearances.
                    For example, once a year each one of the Venezuelan military services had its
                    annual day. There were parades, luncheon, with drinks (there never was enough
                    food — I like to eat and they like to drink). After a couple of drinks a lot of
                    these generals would come up to me and say, “We think your policy in Central
                    America is just right. I don't know why our government is not supporting it
                    more.” It was a very uncomfortable situation because I may have just left the
                    Foreign Ministry where I had an argument with the Foreign Minister about
                    Nicaragua or Salvador, and here are all these high ranking officers telling me
                    that their government is wrong and our government is right.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How effective did you find our military assistance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: Very good. We had quite a few US military exchange programs in Venezuela.
                    Venezuela has too high an income to qualify for military assistance, but it does
                    buy advanced weapon systems, including the F-16 fighter, which is the most
                    sophisticated weapon system we have sold in Latin America. The Venezuelans read
                    up on our latest literature and know exactly what to buy. Whenever there was a
                    blowup somewhere, like in the Middle East, and something new was used, they
                    immediately wanted that.</p>
                <p>By the way, that is a problem, because Venezuela is a friendly country and we do
                    want to be as forthcoming as possible with them if they feel they have a
                    legitimate defense need. But at the same time, Venezuela is surrounded by other
                    friendly countries with which Venezuela has had some problems, such as
                    Colombia...and once I was right in the middle of a flare-up over a border issue,
                    which is very common in Latin America. The border between Venezuela and Colombia
                    has changed many times in the last 200 years.</p>
                <p>There is a body of water called the Gulf of Venezuela, which is where Lake
                    Maracaibo empties out very close to the Colombia border which is claimed in part
                    by Colombia. In August, 1987, Colombia decided, for whatever reason, to send a
                    frigate to this gulf and anchor it there. The Venezuelans were quite upset and
                    sent a couple of F-16s flying at supersonic speeds...which, by the way is a
                    smart thing to do. They didn't fire any shots they just sent the most
                    sophisticated supersonic airplane in Latin America causing, of course, sonic
                    booms and breaking glass, over this frigate.</p>
                <p>We were up a couple of nights waiting for something to happen because for some
                    reason they decided to play around at night. The Colombians would send a Mirage
                    in the middle of the night over the border to see how quickly the Venezuelans
                    would react and the answer was “very quickly”. It was pretty testy there for a
                    while.</p>
                <p>The Venezuelans asked me for a number of very sophisticated weapons at the time
                    and that, of course, caused an enormous flap here. We have review committees,
                    Defense, CIA, NSC, State, etc...and the Colombians were asking either for the
                    same thing or for us not to give the Venezuelans something that would give them
                    an undue advantage. Both sides were accusing us of siding with the other.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>This was not true, we didn't want them fighting with each other. I remember
                    telling the Venezuelan President and saying publicly...I happened to accept an
                    invitation to give a speech at their equivalent of the National War College and
                    the first question after my talk was from a colonel who said, “We have been
                    friends of the United States, but Colombia sent troops to Korea, so therefore
                    you will probably feel that you will have to repay them and side with them.” I
                    said, “Listen, Colombia sent troops to Korea because I am sure they felt it was
                    in their interest to do so. I can only talk about what is going on right now. If
                    there is a fight between Colombia and Venezuela, three countries would suffer
                    and they are: Colombia, Venezuela and the United States. That is because we are
                    friendly with both of you. You are both democracies, you are sister republics.”
                    They were satisfied with the answer because I think they could tell we were
                    genuine, honest.</p>
                <p>In our hemisphere, if two countries fight, immediately the United States is drawn
                    in. We end up getting a black eye, or two, as a result. So finally things calmed
                    down. The Presidents of both countries started talking to each other and calmed
                    things down.</p>
                <p>I knew things were serious, for example, when they sent all of our military
                    trainers and instructors home. That presence of our people is very positive.
                    They have learned to see Americans as what we are, not as stereotypes. We are
                    human beings, we do not have horns, we are not out to exploit somebody else's
                    natural resources. There are a lot of exchanges and they come to our military
                    schools. They have a large presence of military attach�s here and we do
                    there.</p>
                <p>I also benefitted from our military presence because DOD had a little plane which
                    I got to use. The presence of the Ambassador on the plane immediately opened up
                    entire segments of the populations which they may not have had access to
                    otherwise. There were no closed areas, but if the attach� said that the
                    Ambassador would like to go visit the Amazon region, then they rolled out the
                    red carpet. In many remote areas of their country, the military, as was the fact
                    in our own frontier days, is the biggest presence. So it was very helpful to
                    have our military there. I got tremendous access to otherwise difficult to reach
                    areas of the country.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Assistant Secretary of State for Latin American
                        Affairs is Elliott Abrams part of that time. He became a very controversial
                        person. To my mind he got himself into a confrontation with Congress which
                        is a losing situation. How did you see him from your point of view?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: I had known him before when he was Assistant Secretary for Human Rights.
                    In fact I had known him before that. He and I had come from a similar
                    philosophical school to mine, which is the neoconservative...former Democrats
                    who turned to the Republican Party. I have a very high regard for Elliott, as a
                    person and as a colleague.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is the name of the paper...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: You mean Commentary magazine? In fact, Elliott is related by marriage to
                    it. He is the son-in-law to Norman Podhoretz, correct.</p>
                <p>Elliott is a very smart guy and I frankly was surprised that he ended up in that
                    situation. I think he did it out of frustration because I am convinced that he
                    did nothing wrong. He is a lawyer and an honest guy. He would never knowingly do
                    something illegal or unethical. But like most people who were around Ollie
                    North...the figure of speech that I use to describe it is that Ollie North threw
                    a bunch of hand grenades around and some people got hit by shrapnel. You could
                    be standing far enough away thinking you wouldn't get hit, but you still got
                    hit. Elliott was one, I was one. I was just grazed, compared to Elliott. I think
                    that Elliott was also seeing some of the dishonesty that I was referring to
                    earlier in the Congress and in the press and he just got frustrated and lost his
                    cool and let them have it. And I think, frankly, some of them deserved it. But
                    you can't win a public battle with the press and the Congress.</p>
                <p>Some of those people got their comeuppance, like Jim Wright, the Speaker of the
                    House who left in disgrace. He used the Central America issue for partisan
                    political purposes. The fact is that he did, in my opinion, actively undermine
                    the policy of the Executive Branch. He established not only direct lines of
                    communication with what was then a hostile government—the Sandinista
                    government—but he had press conferences and other events to undermine the
                    Administration position. Congress was never intended to do that, in my opinion,
                    by the founding fathers. The Executive Branch was to execute policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any problems with the White House or the
                        State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>REICH: Nothing serious. I had the usual bureaucratic problems that everybody has.
                    I remember in November, 1986 there was a Presidential meeting with the
                    ambassadors of those countries with which we had a narcotics problem. Venezuela
                    was left out. Compared to Bolivia, Turkey, Pakistan, Mexico, Peru and Colombia,
                    it is true that Venezuela did not have a serious narcotics problem. But it was
                    beginning to happen. There had been armed clashes on the border where Venezuelan
                    soldiers were killed by narcotics traffickers. People were shocked in Venezuela
                    that the narcotics traffickers in Colombia had the power and the temerity to
                    cross the border and kill on Venezuelan soil. So I decided that it was in our
                    interests to have me, as the Ambassador, to be present at that meeting. I had to
                    fight the bureaucracy; they didn't want to invite the US Ambassador to
                    Venezuela. There wasn't a serious problem compared to some others. The State
                    Department said that the White House was in charge of invitees and I would have
                    to talk with them (which was usually the way to get an Ambassador to drop the
                    issue). The White House said that the State Department was telling them which
                    ambassadors they want. So, I went directly to higher ups and I got invited. And
                    it was very important. It got front page coverage in Venezuela that I was there
                    promoting Venezuela's case in the battle against narcotics.</p>
                <p>So there were little things like that. You fight bureaucratic battles every
                    single day, which is one of the frustrations of being in the government that I
                    don't miss. I think you spend as much time battling your own government as you
                    do battling hostile governments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have always told young officers coming in that the art
                        of diplomacy really has nothing to do with dealing with countries overseas.
                        It deals first within the Embassy and then within the government at
                        home.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REICH: Absolutely right. Management problems within the Embassy can consume your
                    entire day. Personnel problems that exist...I had a pretty large Embassy, over
                    300 people, including contractors, TDYers, etc. You have to deal with those
                    issues. Then you have the press problems. I started out my staff meeting every
                    morning by having my public affairs officer tell us what the headlines were, the
                    big issues and anything that affected us and we might have to prepare guidance
                    for. The mishandling of a public issue can also ruin your day. You only have one
                    day and one day can easily be ruined by five or six different things, so you end
                    up working very long hours.</p>
                <p>Another, of course, is battling the bureaucracy in Washington, and there are so
                    many different entities. Not only within State Department...you have all these
                    various conflicting interests in State, all the Bureaus...but also the agencies
                    represented in the Embassy. And there were other agencies that were not
                    represented that still could influence.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>I remember a very irresponsible thing that was done by an assistant US attorney
                    in Miami. He sent, without telling the State Department or the Justice
                    Department, customs agents and people from his office to Caracas on an
                    undercover mission—without telling us! They tried to lure a Colombian narcotics
                    trafficker into Venezuela. There could have been an armed battle in the streets
                    of Caracas. Our own agents could have been killed because we didn't know another
                    agency of our own government was involved. I had a rather large DEA contingency
                    in the Embassy. They had the full cooperation of the Venezuelan government and
                    they were after the same narcotics traffickers, and this idiot in Miami sent
                    agents of the United States into a sovereign country without telling that
                    country or his own. Things like that can ruin your day. That one practically
                    ruined the entire month.</p>
                <p>What happened was...the Venezuelan have very good intelligence, they know what is
                    happening in their country. I got a call from their President's Chief of Staff
                    saying, “Do you know anything about American agents here trying to capture a
                    Colombian narcotics trafficker.” I said, “No.” He must have thought “either this
                    guy, the American Ambassador, is lying to me or he is an idiot or is ignorant”.
                    Well, I was ignorant. And I was furious when I found out what had happened.
                    First I asked DEA, thinking they were pulling something on me, but they knew
                    nothing. I asked if Washington would have sent people without telling them. They
                    said “No.”</p>
                <p>It took the entire day to find out what it was. I had to call the Chief of Staff
                    back and apologize admitting that I had no idea they were in the country and
                    they would be sent home immediately. And they were.</p>
                <p>Now I do have to go.</p>
                <p>
