                <p>JAMES L. TULL</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Raymond Ewing</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: May 31, 2001</p>
                <p>Copyright 2003 ADST</p>
                <p>Q: This is an oral history interview with James L. Tull. It's May 31, 2001. My
                    name is Raymond Ewing. This is being conducted for the Foreign Affairs Oral
                    History Program of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training. Jim, it
                    looks like you entered the Foreign Service about 1958. You were born and raised
                    in Iowa. Tell me how you came to be interested in the Foreign Service. I assume
                    you took the written examination at some point along the line.</p>
                <p>TULL: My first recollection of interest in the Foreign Service came as a result
                    of an article about 1949 in the Saturday Evening Post magazine. It spoke
                    generally about the service and some of its training programs. The more I read
                    about it, the more it seemed to become the main focus of my attention as I
                    looked toward college. At the same time, I had long been interested in municipal
                    government and administration, too. But gradually that took second place. I did
                    hedge my bets a bit by taking a masters in public administration, knowing how
                    chancy entrance into the Service could be. But urban affairs soon became my
                    fall-back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A city manager?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: Something like that.</p>
                <p>Q: You were in the Navy. Did you do overseas service on a ship, or were you in
                    the States?</p>
                <p>TULL: I was in an enlisted air rating for four years, so I did more flying and
                    flying- related work than I did aboard ship. I was at various training
                    facilities here from Feb. through Dec. 1951, served about a year and a half
                    overseas, and then was assigned in the San Francisco Bay area until my discharge
                    in early 1955.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you came back and finished at the University of
                        Colorado iBoulder?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>TULL: Yes, first I finished my undergraduate degree in political science and
                    then, having plenty of GI (Government Issue) bill left, I completed my masters.
                    I think it was in late 1956 just before I received my bachelors that I took both
                    the Foreign Service written and oral exams at the old federal court house in
                    Denver.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you passed them the first time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: Yes, and entered the Service just after receiving my masterin April, 1958
                    with about twenty-five others.</p>
                <p>Q: You did your initial training at the Foreign Service Institute, then located
                    in the underground garage of the Arlington Towers apartment building in
                    Rosslyn.</p>
                <p>TULL: Yes, I was a language-probationer so I did the regular, four-month Spanish
                    language course there after the A-100 course, and then early-morning language
                    studies for about a year. At that time, the State Department was short on travel
                    and housing funds so all of my class was assigned to jobs in Washington. I was
                    very lucky to be assigned to the Bureau of Inter-American Affairs as its junior
                    post management officer for South America. We had to back-stop about twenty
                    posts and it was excellent management training. I learned that Foreign Service
                    administration could be a very useful and valuable tool, rather than something
                    to be shunned and avoided- an excellent first lesson for any new officer. I
                    stayed there until mid-1960.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went off to our small consulate in Cali, Columbia
                        as a vice consul.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: Yes, three officers, one American secretary, and seven Colombian staff. It
                    was an excellent little post in a beautiful city. Years later when I was DCM
                    (Deputy Chief of Mission) in Bogota, we wanted to go back to Cali to visit
                    friends, but unfortunately because of the drug-related security problems in that
                    area, our RSO (Regional Security Officer) simply would not permit it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The consulate in Cali was closed at some point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: Yes, both Cali and Medellin were closed in the 1970s and stilhave not
                    reopened because of the narco-guerilla security problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But at the time you were there in the early 1960s, you
                        probabldid both consular and administrative work.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>TULL: Yes, and quite a bit of commercial work too. The all-around nature of the
                    work was nearly ideal for a new officer at his first post. Jack Ohmans was our
                    consul and officer in charge; Harrison Sherwood was the other vice consul during
                    my tour. We had a good sized AID (Agency for International Development) program
                    headquartered in Cali which ran our education effort for the whole country, and
                    a small USIS (United States Information Service) operation, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Shortly after you arrived in Colombia, John F. Kennedy
                        waelected president. He placed a lot of emphasis on Latin America.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: He visited Colombia about midway through my tour and I was fortunate enough
                    to get called up to Bogota to work for our DCM, Henry Dearborn, who was control
                    officer for the visit. I worked for Henry for about a month prior. Q: A
                    presidential visit at any time can be both exciting and demanding. Did you stay
                    through the visit?</p>
                <p>TULL: Yes, until wheels up and for a couple more days of dismantling things.
                    You're right, it was really demanding on all the staff, but heady too. It was my
                    first glimpse at the effect of presidential power on any event and it was well
                    beyond impressive. We were never short of anything we needed and there was
                    usually six of everything instead of just one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The announcement of the “Alliance for Progress” was
                        actually madin Bogota?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: My memory might be faulty, but I recall he announced it during a speech at
                    a new workers suburb we were building which the Colombians named, “Barrio
                    Kennedy.” Of course a number of months earlier, he had announced the formation
                    of the Peace Corps. I think because of his visit, Colombia (and luckily for us)
                    and the Cali area received the first group of volunteers assigned anywhere in
                    Latin America, “Colombia One.” A superb but overtrained group of young people
                    who badly wanted work, not more preparation!</p>
                <p>Q: In your notes, you reminded me that while you were in Cali, there was
                    something going on called “la violencia.” What was that? What, if any,
                    experience did you personally have with it?</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>TULL: For many years there had been a history of spasmatic violence and bloodshed
                    between the adherents of the Liberal and Conservative Parties in Colombia.
                    Finally, in Bogota in mid-1948, the very popular Liberal leader (and possible
                    president) Jorge Eliec�r Gait�n was assassinated. The country simply blew up.
                    Over the next decade and a half, a quarter million or more men, women, and
                    children were slaughtered in waves of violence that touched nearly every family
                    in the country. This went on until both the Liberals and Conservatives agreed to
                    rotate the presidency of the country between the two parties for a fifteen-year
                    cooling off period. The first president appointed under this scheme was a
                    Liberal newspaperman, Dr. Alberto Lleras Camargo, who was also a very wise and
                    wily politician. He really held the country together and was finishing his term
                    when I arrived. By that time the political violence was dying out but being
                    replaced by an equally bloody siege of banditry and murder particularly in the
                    rural countryside. Many of the best known bandits had nicknames, such as “La
                    Mosca” (The Fly) and “Sangre Negra” (Black Blood.)</p>
                <p>When we got to Bogota years later, the GOC (Government of Colombia) was heavily
                    engaged in battles against several terrorist groups, of which the largest was
                    the FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.) Its senior leader was one
                    Manuel Marulanda whose name struck a distant but familiar note to me. It took me
                    several months to remember that during my Cali tour, he had been just another
                    bloodthirsty bandit named, “Tiro Fijo” (Sure Shot) sneaking about the
                    countryside, stealing coffee and murdering peasants. But now he was DonManuel
                    Marulanda, a very respected guerilla leader. Time flies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the violence was subsiding during the time you were
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: Yes, but it was still dangerous in the countryside after darand possibly
                    fatal if you were accidentally caught in it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But in the city of Cali, day-to-day, normal activity was
                        friendly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: Absolutely. Cali was a lovely city of about 700,000, 3,000 feet up in the
                    Cauca Valley not far off the equator. It had a dry and temperate climate, almost
                    spring-like all year around. It was one of the nicest climates we've ever
                    experienced.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything else we should say about this first assignment
                        iColombia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: No, except the work I did for Henry Dearborn prior to thKennedy visit got
                    me my next job in London.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: Shortly before the end of my tour, a representative from personnel in the
                    Department visited Bogota. Among the things he mentioned to Henry was that he
                    was looking for some officer with staff experience to replace Jackson Smith as
                    staff aide, the junior of two such jobs, in the ambassador's office. Smith
                    wanted the junior political position then vacant to Bogota, but London would not
                    let him go until PER (Personnel) could find a replacement. Dearborn replied that
                    by coincidence, he happened to know of such an officer ready to go in Cali, and
                    that's how my transfer happened.</p>
                <p>Q: Colombia to London. So you became a staff assistant to Ambassador David Bruce,
                    already by that time a highly respected and strong figure in American
                    diplomacy.</p>
                <p>TULL: And one of the most interesting persons I have ever known. He had this long
                    period of both private and public service in Great Britain that went back many
                    years and a host of close friendships from that service. Prior to World War II,
                    he had headed the Red Cross for western Europe; during the war he was in charge
                    of OSS (Office of Strategic Services) operations in western Europe; he knew the
                    royal family and the Queen from the time she was a young girl; then-Prime
                    Minister MacMillan had been a war-time colleague- it had been “Major MacMillan
                    and Colonel Bruce”- and many other acquaintanceships at the top and bottom of
                    British society which gave him an unusual entre into it. For the USG (United
                    States Government), he had already served as a Marshall Plan representative and
                    ambassador to France, West Germany, and Italy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You worked directly for him the whole time you were in
                        London?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: No, Al Wells was the senior of the two staffers- he had already worked for
                    the ambassador in both Bonn and Paris. He worked full time for Ambassador Bruce
                    while I split my time between him and the DCM, first Lewis Jones and then Phil
                    Kaiser.</p>
                <p>Q: Al Wells is the husband of Melissa Wells, several times an ambassador. At that
                    time, was she an economic-commercial officer in London?</p>
                <p>TULL: No, she was in Port of Spain as I recall. Later she was transferred to
                    Paris in the economic section and after Al retired, to London.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't you discuss some of the policy issues you saw in
                        London?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>TULL: I made a note about “Skybolt” as that was the main problem and policy issue
                    we had with the British when I arrived in February 1963. Skybolt was an
                    air-to-air missile we were developing with the British. They were enthusiastic
                    about it as it promised to add years to the operational life of some of their
                    aging U.S.-built air fleet, plus be a major weapons system on a new, all-British
                    first line fighter-bomber, the TSR-2, then on the drawing board. Our enthusiasm,
                    however, was on the wane as development costs climbed higher while problems
                    continued to mount with the weapon's guidance system. Finally, Secretary of
                    Defense McNamara and his Whiz Kids team announced that Skybolt development was
                    canceled. The British were devastated. Not only were their hopes dashed, but
                    they felt they had not been consulted on a project in which they had been
                    partners. Later on, they also felt forced to cancel their TSR-2 plans and
                    believed we had unilaterally left them high and dry. This caused a tremendous
                    dustup in the UK (United Kingdom.) And President Kennedy was also upset, this
                    coming soon after the strong criticism he suffered following the Bay of Pigs
                    fiasco in Cuba.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was finally done about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: There was a lot of hand holding and quiet apologizing. The president
                    invited the prime minister and his cabinet to a summit meeting in Bermuda where
                    joint defense policy and how to manage it was the main topic. For my first six
                    months or so, the ambassador was fully engaged in calming things down and
                    soothing bruised feelings- tasks at which he was superb. But then Kennedy was
                    killed- a stunning blow for the British as well as ourselves. We were much
                    involved in all of the ceremonies of remembrance and mourning that were held
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They felt very close to President Kennedy. Was this
                        partlbecause of his father or more for what the president represented?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>TULL: His father was never popular there because as ambassador in 1940-41, he had
                    been very skeptical of the British ability to survive Hitler's onslaught. I
                    think the president was attractive to them for many of the same reasons he was
                    to us: superbly intelligent and prepared as a leader, personally attractive,
                    witty, quick on his feet and personable. Their sense of loss was nearly as deep
                    as our own. But all in all, it was an exciting time to be in London:
                    economically, things were excellent with Prime Minister MacMillan, called
                    “SuperMac” by a grateful public; his Conservative Party appeared firmly in
                    control of the government; in the pop music world, the Beatles and the Rolling
                    Stones arrived on the scene; Mary Quant ruled British fashions while in the
                    cultural area, John Osborne was leading a new wave of writers and playwrights.
                    Unfortunately, however, a new, major sex scandal also arrived, headed by HMG's
                    (Her Majesty's Government) minister for the army, John Profumo, who then
                    committed the truly unforgivable sin of lying about it to the House of Commons.
                    MacMillan and his cabinet soon resigned and although replaced by another
                    Conservative regime, national elections were shortly called and the Labour Party
                    of Harold Wilson won a substantial majority. All of this in the space of less
                    than two short years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was David Bruce on good terms with the Labour
                        government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: Unsurprisingly, yes. As a matter of fact, before the election when Wilson
                    was shadow prime minister, he occasionally lunched privately with the ambassador
                    at the embassy. Also, our newly-arrived DCM, Phil Kaiser, found that he had been
                    college mates at Oxford with Wilson's new minister of defense, Denis Healey,
                    Foreign Secretary George Brown, and several other key Labor officials. So we did
                    not lose a beat in the contact area- to be expected, I guess, given the
                    ambassador's span on acquaintances across political, economic, clerical, and
                    press and broadcast lines. However, the Labor government became increasingly
                    critical of our role in Vietnam and its relationship with Lyndon Johnson, which
                    was cool at best. At one point early in 1965 Wilson was returning from a visit
                    to the far east and we picked up that he planned a very critical speech upon his
                    arrival. The foreign secretary by coincidence was due for an official visit to
                    Washington a few days later. I was awakened in the middle of the night with a
                    personal message from the secretary telling Foreign Secretary Brown that if the
                    prime minister made that speech, the secretary would definitely not find it
                    “convenient” to receive Brown as planned. Wilson thought better of those
                    remarks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a visitors office at the embassy or did you
                        have tdo all of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>TULL: Fortunately for me, we had probably the best organized and most efficient
                    person I have ever had the pleasure of working with in the person of Miss Joan
                    Auten to run our busy visitors operation. She ran it with precision and a level
                    of contacts probably no one outside the ambassador possessed. For instance, she
                    had “holds” on a half a dozen seats on every U.S. carrier flight out of London
                    which she kept until about forty-five minutes before flight time. Ohio
                    Congressman Wayne Hays was the scourge of Foreign Service administrative
                    sections around the world, but he always gave Joan plenty of advance notice
                    prior to arriving and stepped very lightly around her while visiting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Winston Churchill also died while you were in London,
                        didn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: Yes, in 1965 as I recall. He was by that time quite old and afflicted
                    almost permanently with a depression he had suffered from for much of his life
                    that he called his “black dog.” He did, however, get a brief lift when Congress
                    voted to declare him an American citizen and Ambassador Bruce delivered to him
                    “Honorary United States Passport No. 1.” But a short time later he passed away,
                    quietly in his sleep.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, even death could not catch Sir Winston off guard. A number of years
                    before, Churchill had planned his own funeral in meticulous detail and named it
                    “Operation Hope Not.” When the time arrived, all was in readiness. The
                    ceremonies involved everyone from the Queen down and lasted all day. At last a
                    caisson towed bRoyal Navy enlisted men arrived with his casket at the Tower of
                    London, to be transferred across the Thames and then by train to Blenheim Castle
                    for his burial. As his body was being carried to a waiting river launch, pipers
                    ringing the battlements of the White Tower struck up the Scottish lament, “Will
                    Ye No Come Here Again?” A heart- stopping moment the like of which I've not seen
                    since.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go from London? To your second assignment
                        iWashington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: Yes, for some work in the field of multilateral diplomacy. I was assigned
                    to Assistant Secretary Joe Sisco's Bureau of International Organizations in the
                    office of United Nations Political Affairs (UNP.) My boss there was Elizabeth
                    Brown and my particular brief was the then-draft Treaty on the Non-Proliferation
                    of Nuclear Weapons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was in 1965. What was the status of the Treaty
                        then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: It was still in the negotiating stage but quite far along at that point. By
                    the time I finished up in UNP in 1967, I believe it had been signed by all the
                    principals, plus the Outer Space Treaty, too.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go to some of the negotiating sessions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: No, these were mainly handled on our side by senior negotiators from the
                    Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA) and the legal advisor's office. But
                    our work in UNP was closely tied to ACDA and I did some other delegation work in
                    both New York and Geneva.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the United Nations Disarmament Committee (UNDC) still
                        meetinin Geneva at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: No, the UNDC had closed and its duties were being taken up at New York in
                    Committee One, the political committee of the UN General Assembly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were primarily preparing position papers, analysis,
                        aninstruction for our delegations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: Yes, mine was a desk officer position in UNP but for multilateral rather
                    than the usual bilateral, country-to-country affairs. Plus a few odds and ends.
                    For instance, I drafted Justice Arthur Goldberg's remarks for his confirmation
                    hearings as our ambassador to the United Nations and accompanied him to meet
                    with Senator Fulbright and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And he was confirmed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: Yes, as he humorously told Joe, “Despite everything Tull couldo!”</p>
                <p>Q: Say a few words about working for Joe Sisco.</p>
                <p>TULL: I admired Joe although there were many who did not. He was tough and could
                    be very demanding, almost to the point of being unfair and rude. He really knew
                    how to make a bureaucracy produce and he drove himself as hard as anyone who
                    worked for him. He also was a whirlwind of activities and ideas. His interplay
                    with my boss, Elizabeth Brown, who headed the UNP office, was fascinating.
                    Elizabeth, who I always felt should have been a chief of mission, was every bit
                    as bright and determined as Joe. When they collided- about once a week- you
                    could read a newspaper from the sparks and fire. But she did not give an inch if
                    she felt she was right and I think Joe respected and even enjoyed that. They
                    were good friends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They both had very strong backgrounds in the UN. I think
                        then Jowas a Reserve Officer- I don't think he ever served abroad.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>TULL: I think you're right. He was often talked about for an ambassadorship but I
                    don't think he was very interested- my guess is that he saw his main
                    opportunities in Washington. Of course, Mrs. Sisco had an outstanding career in
                    her own right.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, she was the vice president of the Woodward and Lothrop department store.
                    I think Joe was also very much involved with and knowledgeable about the Middle
                    East. Was that your recollection?</p>
                <p>TULL: I think that might have come later but of course, the Middle East did not
                    loom as large for us then as it does now. Wasn't there also what was called a
                    “Sisco Plan” for settling the Cyprus problem?</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, in 1974 and probably to some extent earlier too. But especially in 1974.
                    I think he was under secretary of political affairs by that time. Anything else
                    about this assignment to UNP?</p>
                <p>TULL: No, I enjoyed learning a bit about the multilateral side othe house. It was
                    a good tour for me.</p>
                <p>Q: IO (International Organizations) has always been a good office in Washington
                    in terms of getting involved in a number of important issues. I wanted to ask
                    you a bit about the relationship between UNP (United Nations Political) and the
                    U.S. (United States) mission to the United Nations (UN); how did the two get
                    along in those days? You noted you drafted Goldberg's confirmation remarks.</p>
                <p>TULL: The relationship was no better than it is now- highly competitive for
                    control of our policies and positions. The UN ambassadorship is not a
                    cabinet-level job, whatever President Johnson promised Goldberg, and I think the
                    justice was foolish to give up his seat on the Supreme Court for it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go from UNP then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>TULL: Dr. Coby Oliver, a law professor from the University of Pennsylvania, was a
                    non-career appointee (and old school teacher friend from Texas) of President
                    Johnson. He had been on the job for a little over a year as assistant secretary
                    for inter-American affairs and his special assistant was transferring. From
                    somewhere, Covey got my name just as I was finishing up in UN political and
                    called me over to talk about this vacancy. I was a bit reluctant- I recalled
                    Ambassador Bruce once saying that while staff jobs could be perfectly good
                    positions on the career ladder in the British Foreign Service, for American
                    officers about one, or a maximum two, were all any career could stand. But I
                    really wanted to get back to Latin America affairs and Johnson (and thus Oliver)
                    appeared to be on his way out due to Vietnam, so I accepted. And that was the
                    way it worked out.</p>
                <p>Q: So you went there in 1967 and were special assistant, as opposed to staff
                    assistant, so you didn't have to do quite as much paper shuffling as you had in
                    London.</p>
                <p>TULL: Correct, I had a staffer working for me and stayed about year and a
                    half.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you do much traveling with the assistant
                        secretary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: Some. I went with him several times to Central and South America. At one
                    point, the president wanted the Peruvians to buy F-5's instead of French
                    Mirages, so he gave us a plane and told Covey to go try to convince their
                    president, Fernando Belaunde Terry (unsuccessfully). We also attended some NATO
                    (North Atlantic Trade Organization) and other meetings in Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you stay on in ARA (American Republic Affairs) after
                        Oliveleft?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: Just briefly. In early 1969, Nick McCausland, the chief of our political
                    section in Montevideo, resigned and Bob Sayre, who had been Covey's deputy, was
                    now ambassador and asked me to take over the section, so that's where we
                    went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we talk about your role in the embassy as head
                        of thpolitical section? How many were assigned to the section?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>TULL: It was a four-officer section: a chief, a deputy, a junior officer, and a
                    labor officer, plus two American secretaries and one Uruguayan political
                    specialist. At that time, Montevideo was a little Mexico City in the sense that
                    Uruguay was the one country in South America where all the Communist Bloc
                    nations were represented. The Soviets had a huge mission and we believed they
                    operated many regional political programs from there. So our section was fairly
                    good sized while our intelligence offices were several times larger. I served
                    there almost five years with three different station chiefs. On the whole our
                    relationships were pretty good, but there was always heavy competition in
                    political reporting and analysis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But your main interest was not so much bloc and other
                        embassieand missions, but more Uruguay internal.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: That'right. Uruguay had had a highly developed democracy for a long time so
                    traditional political reporting and all occupied much of our time. The new
                    element was the effect on the political scene of an active urban terrorist group
                    which also targeted us and other missions friendly to the GOU (Government of
                    Uruguay) to some extent. We of course had seen this before- Ambassador John
                    Gordon Mein had been killed several years earlier from some Guatemalan
                    guerrillas who later kidnaped Labor Officer Sean Holly; a Brazilian group had
                    also taken our ambassador, Burke Elbrect, for a time. Now, however, we faced
                    what I believe was the best organized, most determined, and most effective urban
                    terrorist organization thus far in the National Liberation Movement (MLN), also
                    called the Tupamaros after the 17th century Peruvian Indian rebel leader Tupac
                    Amaru.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they aiming their effort at the U.S. or mainly at
                        thUruguayan government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: Their principal aim was to weaken and eventually bring down the
                    democratically-elected Colorado Party administration of President Jorge Pacheco
                    Areco. Part of that effort was to attack us and other embassies supporting the
                    Pacheco government, such as the British and Brazilian, in the hope that other
                    nations would withdraw their support and put such pressure on the GOU as to
                    further weaken it. The Tupamaros were radical Marxist, almost anarchist at
                    times, in ideology and were convinced that the country's democratic institutions
                    were corrupt to the core. They themselves- doctors, lawyers, writers and others
                    in the arts, university students and the like. They often spoke and wrote- they
                    were prodigious writers and pamphleteers- of the need to awaken the
                    “revolutionary consciousness” of the common people who they viewed as easily led
                    and sheep-like- on occasion they referred to them as “cascariaje” or “floor
                    sweepings.” This was definitely not a popular, mass movement. They viewed the
                    Soviet Union as too bourgeois!</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had your family there and had to take certain
                        precautions, suppose?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>TULL: Yes, it was difficult and confining- most of all I think for our single
                    people who didn't have a family group to depend on. After the head of AID's
                    public safety office was killed, we placed guards on all our apartments and
                    houses, but with a bit of difference from the normal- our guards were inside
                    rather than out, because too many outside guards were being attacked by the MLN.
                    Also, unlike their Montenero counterparts in Argentina, the Tupamaros were
                    always careful to avoid attacking or harming children or women. So in order to
                    stretch our limited security money as far as possible, guards were in our homes
                    only when the employee was there- the guard left when the employee did. We did
                    this with eyes wide open but I know we all had some sleepless nights thinking,
                    what about our wives and kids if we guessed wrong?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Tupamaro movement well underway when you arrived,
                        and wait confined mainly to Montevideo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: Yes, it was underway but had, at that point, limited its attacks to a few
                    non-lethal back robberies and arms thefts from police and military depots. The
                    serious kidnapings and murders did not begin until later in 1969. The MLN, or
                    “Orga” as they liked to call themselves, was classically organized into small,
                    mainly independent cells in a loose hierarchy designed for maximum security and
                    independent action at the lowest risk. There were some cells outside the
                    capital, but even Uruguay's few interior cities of any size were too small to
                    give much cover.</p>
                <p>Q: Uruguay was a well established democracy, the so-called “Switzerland of South
                    America.” Was the government of that time pretty liberal or weak?</p>
                <p>TULL: The short answer is that the administration of Jorge Pacheco was so
                    fearful, weak, and- there's no other word for it- stupid, that it played
                    directly into the Tupamaros' hands by weakening the country's free institution
                    to the point where the military finally took over and democratic government, as
                    MLN had hoped, collapsed. What the Tupamaros did not realize was that the price
                    of their success would be their ultimate defeat. But there is some necessary
                    history here. Uruguay had been living well for nearly fifty years through two
                    world wars and Korea on ever-increasing prices for its three main exports: meat,
                    wool, and hides. Out of this had come an advanced welfare state supporting a
                    large and pampered middle class. In those days-and for years and years- it
                    really was possible to retire at age forty on a full salary. But in the
                    mid-1950s, world prices for its goods spiraled down, never really to recover.
                    The nation lived on its reserves until they disappeared, but neither the public
                    nor their politics were willing to take the hard steps necessary to cut back and
                    live within their means. Inflation outstripped salaries and living costs, the
                    middle class became impoverished, and all the blame was placed on the
                    “government and the corrupt politician.” And I believe from the dinner table
                    conversations of woe by formerly economically well-off middle class parents came
                    the young and embittered Tupamaro youth.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TULL: Yes and on all sides. Uruguayans are usually very open and gregarious,
                    which made it easy to do our work. We even had a couple of very tentative,
                    second-hand contacts with the Tupamaros themselves, but these never came to
                    anything really useful. We all had contacts throughout the administration who
                    were highly intelligent and much to be admired but Pacheco himself, a former
                    boxer and failed politician who took office from a dead-end position as vice
                    president only upon the unexpected death of his popular predecessor. Pacheco
                    could not bear criticism and viewed increasingly harsh and repressive measures
                    as the only acceptable response to MLN attacks. Except for his closest
                    supporters, our contacts could only shrug in resignation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To what degree did the Tupamaros get support or were
                        influencefrom outside Uruguay?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: Ideologically, I think they were the closest to the Maoist Chinese or the
                    Albanians. I believe they did get some material help from the Cubans and maybe
                    some training too. Che Guevara was after all an Argentine who grew up only forty
                    miles away across the Rio de la Plata and at that time, was still a tremendous
                    hero-figure for much of Uruguayan youth. But there was no doubt that this was an
                    indigenous movement.</p>
                <p>Q: Before we talk about the election, the military takeover, and the end of the
                    Tupamaros, why don't we discuss the embassy's AID program and the problems that
                    developed out of that?</p>
                <p>TULL: Our AID program was not particularly large- in the thirty-five to forty
                    million dollar range of loans- nor did it have any unusual elements for Latin
                    America at that time. We had efforts in the education, health, and agricultural
                    advisory areas, but like many AID groups in the area we also had a public safety
                    program devoted to helping modernize the woeful Uruguayan police.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>Dan Mitrioni arrived in Montevideo about the middle of 1969 to take charge of our
                    three-man public safety unit just as murders and assaults by the Tupamaros were
                    on the rise. Originally, he had been chief of police in Richmond, Indiana, and
                    had just completed a public safety tour of duty in Brazil. It did not take long
                    before MLN pamphlets began to appear charging that Dan had been sent to teach
                    the police “torture,” a double irony. First, modern police methods are the
                    antithesis of personal mistreatment and second, it is ludicrous to think that
                    any Latin nation which suffered through the horrors of Spanish colonial
                    administration would have anything to learn from anyone about mistreating
                    opponents. Nevertheless, as the Pacheco regime pressed for more and more hard
                    police measures, even Dan and his fellow officers began to wonder about the
                    viability of their program. Then one day in mid-1970 he was forced from his car,
                    beaten, and hustled away by a dozen or so MLN assailants. Despite a massive
                    manhunt, a few days later, he was found dead on a suburban street, hands wired
                    behind his back and shot four times in the back.</p>
                <p>Almost immediately a further wave of violence broke: in short order, Brazilian
                    Consul Gomide and British Ambassador Jackson were both kidnaped and held for
                    over a year; our cultural officer Nate Rosenfeld was beaten by a Tupamaro gang
                    as they kidnaped his car-pool mate and our junior economic officer, Gordon
                    Jones, who was pistol-whipped nearly unconscious. Nevertheless, he was able to
                    leap bound and blindfolded from the back of a pickup truck and escaped; and
                    finally an American soils specialist, hardly known to any of us, named Claude
                    Fly, was kidnaped from an Uruguayan agricultural laboratory and held until he
                    suffered a heart attack and nearly died.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was Claude Fly and why was he kidnaped by the
                        Tupamaros?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: These were exactly the questions we asked when we heard about it. As it
                    turned out, Fly was not an AID employee or even employed directly by the USG,
                    but had been hired by the Uruguayan ministry of agriculture with funds from an
                    AID agricultural loan. By that time, our security guard was up pretty high.
                    Fly's office in the country had no protection and the MLN probably realized that
                    one American was about as valuable as another for kidnaping purposes. A number
                    of months after Fly was taken, the only portable electrocardiogram machine in
                    the country suddenly disappeared. The reason for this became clear one night
                    when Fly was delivered to the steps of the British hospital in Montevideo with a
                    full diagnosis of his heart attack and electrocardiogram record pinned to his
                    jacket! A gift, we thought, from our friends at the university's faculty of
                    medicine.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this was full blown crisis management. How was morale

                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>TULL: Of course people were scared and precautions were tight. The ambassador
                    made it clear that no one had to stay and that anyone could seek a transfer
                    without prejudice. A couple of newly arrived single people did, but Dan's murder
                    made it difficult to bail out. And in then end, we just hunkered down and rode
                    it out. Here I should say a word about Ambassador and Mrs. Adair. They were
                    superb, without peers in this tough spot. Mrs. Adair worked especially hard to
                    set up the residence as the recreational refuge for our wives and kids, and this
                    proved a wonderful aide to morale. What a lovely pair!</p>
                <p>Q: Talk a bit more about the embassy's philosophy and approach in dealing with
                    the kidnap and hostage situations. To what extent at that time were we trying to
                    deal directly or negotiate with the Tupamaros, or were we treating only with the
                    GOU and/or trying to locate third parties?</p>
                <p>TULL: As you can guess, we took our line strictly from Washington and it was a
                    very rigid, “no negotiations/no ransom” approach. But looking back on it, I
                    doubt it really mattered; I saw nothing about the MLN that led me to believe
                    they had the slightest interest in negotiating with us or the Brazilians or the
                    British or any third party. Their fixed aim was to destroy the government and
                    its institutions. Like most radical extreme movements, there was very little
                    flexibility in their goals and objectives, once decided upon.</p>
                <p>Q: You mentioned earlier a conservative government, beset by public order
                    problems and relying upon repressive measures to reply. Speak a bit about these
                    and their effect upon civil society, the press, the culture at that particular
                    time- was it still fairly open?</p>
                <p>TULL: The Pacheco administration relied almost completely on the limited state of
                    siege measures granted to the executive branch under the Constitution “medidas
                    prontas de seguridad” (fast measures of safety)- for periods of up to ninety
                    days. Although designed to be temporary, President Pacheco, by a rolling series
                    of back-to-back decrees, made them nearly permanent for about three years. Under
                    the Constitution, the Senate and Chamber of Deputies could jointly lift these
                    measures at any time. However, continual partisan battles to prevent any party
                    from gaining an advantage, plus the closeness of the 1971 national elections in
                    which no politician wanted to appear “soft” on terrorism, plus increasing
                    nervousness about the intentions of the military in the face of legislative
                    weakness, all combined to render the legislature impotent in the face of
                    Pacheco's determination. The “medidas” (measures) fell most heavily on tight
                    control of the press and broadcasting, freedom and public protest, as well as
                    causing increasing timidity among the public in the exercise of freedom of
                    speech. Looking back upon it, however, I'm amazed to recall how free we felt,
                    certainly not like eastern Europe.</p>

                        them.</hi>

                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>TULL: We- those in my section- at the outset decided with the ambassador's full
                    blessing to go flat out in both Montevideo and the campo to cover every phase,
                    party, and party faction we could. It seemed to us that things were headed for
                    some kind of crossroads and that the elections might be “make or break,” though
                    it appeared to be late if democracy were to be saved. There were three main
                    parties at play: the more liberal Colorado Party centered in Montevideo and the
                    country's few other urban areas; the conservative and rural-based Blanco Party,
                    then in opposition; and a new leftist and mainly urban coalition party, the
                    “Frente Amplio” (broad front) composed of a number of different groups including
                    the legal Communist Party, radical labor unions and some student groups plus
                    overt elements of the Tupamaros although not identified openly as such. The
                    leaders of the “Frente” hoped to wrestle control of the city government of
                    Montevideo from the Colorados who had held it for many years. Despite the state
                    of siege measures, the contest was very hard fought and wide ranging. Rallies
                    were massive, no verbal quarter was asked nor given and in the end the vote was
                    open, fair, and honest. Unfortunately for the nation, the Colorado faction
                    headed previously by President Pacheco won narrowly and elected a wealthy
                    rancher, Juan Maria Bordaberry, who took office in early 1972 and whose
                    administration proved even less competent than his predecessor. For us the only
                    bright spot was that we had succeeded in calling the election on the nose-
                    Colorados first in Montevideo, followed by “Frente,” then the Blancos; a Blanco
                    win in the countryside but not enough to make up their urban losses, followed by
                    the Colorados, then the “Frente.” So we got a nice pat on the head from
                    Assistant Secretary John Crimmins- John was a bit bearish and tended to dole out
                    praise in pretty small doses- but things looked bleak for Uruguay.</p>

                    services, initially opposed the coup but could not in the end stand alone.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TULL: No, the Brazilian and Argentine military were both in power and encouraging
                    particularly the army to move, but it held off for nearly a year until February
                    1973.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TULL: No, not for many years, all the way back to the late 19th century. By the
                    time I arrived in 1969, the military services were almost a joke so far as
                    effective organization and command and control were concerned. But by three
                    years later, that certainly was not the case.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Uruguayan military getting a lot of help from
                        us?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: No. We had a small military group, but it was mainly devoted to selling
                    spare parts for the navy's ancient World War II-era destroyers and the Air
                    Force's propeller-driven trainers. I don't recall that we did any sales to the
                    army, certainly not weapons. Most of the outside help was coming from Argentina
                    and Brazil.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the Uruguayan political leadership was encouraging

                </p>
                <p>TULL: No, quite to the contrary, they were afraid of the military. They were no
                    fools- they could see, as with their neighbors, that any military move would be
                    at their expense and personally dangerous for them- and they were right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To what extent did you, the embassy, and the ambassador
                        see thmilitary takeover coming?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: By the end of 1972, Bordaberry had been in office nearly a year, but it was
                    no secret that the military was becoming increasingly unhappy with his
                    ineffectual regime and was not going to tolerate the Tupamaro situation
                    indefinitely. It was later that month that a middle grade naval officer,
                    presumably on the orders of his bosses, told first our naval attache, then the
                    ambassador and several others of us, that the army would move within ten days.
                    And they did. During the sunny morning hours of the first of February, the army
                    locked the legislative palace and began to empty and shutter the various
                    civilian ministries of the government.</p>
                <p>Shops and stores closed, but being Uruguayans and it still being summer, most
                    people headed not for the shelters, but for the city's beaches. President
                    Bordaberry began calling friends and supporters and urging Montevideans via
                    brief radio announcements to rally by his side. By early afternoon, several of
                    us viewing the port from the ambassador's office watched a dramatic scene
                    unfold. Thirty-two years after the German battleship “Graf Spee” had begun its
                    ill-fated charge out of the neutral port of Montevideo, there came boiling down
                    the harbor channel at flank speed the navy's three old destroyers- the ROU
                    (Republic of Uruguay) Artigas, Uruguay, and Montevideo. Reaching the channel
                    mouth near the still visible but scuttled remains of the “Graf Spee,” the three
                    swung about and abruptly halted, leveling their guns point-blank on the army
                    vehicles then pouring into the port area they had just left. A gallant but
                    futile gesture.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>After a tense, hour-long standoff, cooler heads prevailed and the ships returned
                    quietly to their moorings. Almost dismissively, the army then sent a small body
                    of troops to shoo away the 200 or so supporters gathered at the president's
                    home, while the city's beaches in Pocitos and Carasco remained relaxed and
                    crowded. As the afternoon wore on, the reality of nearly a century of Uruguayan
                    democracy slowly faded- poof!- to a dream. It was all very sad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned earlier that after the military takeover,
                        they dihave success against the Tupamaros and basically ended that
                        movement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: They wrapped it up one Sunday several months later, in mid-1973, with a
                    combination of a tragedy, good police work, and a whole fistful of luck. An army
                    colonel happened to be standing with his family outside a church after service
                    when he was shot in a Tupamaro ambush. The army, which had joined a number of
                    police units conducting clandestine surveillance of a dozen or so suspicious
                    houses and buildings, ordered all of them to be immediately hit and everyone
                    arrested.</p>
                <p>One in the suburb of Carasco, not far from our home, happened to be the main
                    Tupamaro radio and records center. In fact, the last message logged by the
                    Tupamaro operator was to all cells, warning that a major military-police
                    operation was underway but that its target was unknown. The military was soon
                    able to arrest senior MLN leader Raul Sendic and several of his top lieutenants.
                    Some of them talked and more were arrested.</p>
                <p>By the end of 1973, the “Orga” was effectively destroyed. However, the roll up of
                    the Tupamaros also became the signal for widespread attacks and arrests of
                    people deemed MLN supporters and sympathizers. This was personally tragic as I
                    lost a number of friends and acquaintances: the president of the chamber of
                    deputies, Ernesto Gutierrez Ruiz, was murdered as was Senator Zelmar Michelini,
                    both of the Colorado party; Blanco senator and presidential candidate Wilson
                    Ferreira escaped by launch to Buenos Aires but only narrowly missed an
                    assassin's bullet there. “Frente” presidential candidate, retired Army General
                    Liber Serengni, was lucky to make it alive to a military prison, while former
                    President Pacheco's foreign minister and a leading Uruguayan banker suffered
                    broken arms and other injuries during his interrogation.</p>
                <p>Q: This was during the Nixon administration. What was the general response of the
                    United States government to the military's takeover? Was it at all controversial
                    as far as the embassy was concerned?</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>TULL: The Nixon administration was very supportive of the hard line taken first
                    by Presidents Pacheco and Bordaberry, then later by the Uruguayan military. I
                    left in July 1973, but prior to that time I don't recall hearing a single
                    negative word out of Washington. As always, the embassy took its official line
                    from Washington but on a private and personal basis I think many of us believed
                    might have been able, if not to save democracy in Uruguay, at least to have
                    prevented many of the horrors and excesses which took place over the following
                    decade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything else you want to say about this difficult
                        assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: Only a brief PS. Democracy was finally reestablished in Uruguay in July
                    1985, but its economic situation remains difficult as the country continues to
                    feel the fallout from financial problems in both Argentina and Brazil. The
                    current president, Jorge Batlle, was also an unsuccessful candidate in the 1971
                    election. He is the grand nephew of the fabled founder of modern Uruguay, Jose
                    Batlle y Ordo�ez, who was also a very successful duelist.</p>
                <p>Dueling was still legal when I served there and we had several which were set up
                    and run under strict rules by a military court of honor. One of these involved
                    the current president. None during my time were fatal. The leftist coalition,
                    the “Frente Amplio,” still exists with a somewhat different name and a legal,
                    thus far more peaceful, Tupamaro party. The “Frente” has the largest single bloc
                    of members in the Senate which forces the Colorado and Blanco parties to work
                    together- they still don't like it. And the “Frente” really does expect to win
                    the mayorship and control of the Montevideo city government this time, in the
                    national elections of 2004. Finally, I think nearly five years in this boiling
                    pot got me my next assignment in 1973.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To senior training.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: Yes, I believe Uruguay was enough of an attention-getter in Washington to
                    push my name onto the list of students selected to attend the National War
                    College for the academic year 1973-74.</p>
                <p>Q: I usually find with these interviews that I prefer to move fairly quickly over
                    the junior officer training here at the Foreign Service Institute and later at
                    the War Colleges, but I think there is something you ought to say about your
                    year at Fort McNair.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>TULL: When our class gathered there in August 1973, among our military classmates
                    were eight very special ones. Until April they had all been POWs (prisoners of
                    war) in Vietnam and had only left the Hanoi Hilton five months earlier. Among
                    this group was then-Lieutenant Commander and now U.S. Senator Johnny McCain who,
                    like the others, saw this year as a chance to recover from some severe injuries.
                    All were in pretty bad physical condition. This would be a difficult year for
                    them in other ways too. Our year happened to coincide with the Watergate
                    investigation and ultimately the resignation of President Nixon, which left them
                    all conflicted. On the one hand, the revelations of wrongdoing and illegalities
                    were perfectly clear to them as to all of us. At the same time, they believed
                    Nixon literally saved their lives- by Christmas 1972, all were at death's door,
                    certain they could not last more than a few weeks. Nixon's decision then to
                    resume the bombing of Hanoi- “Linebacker 2”- had driven the Vietnamese back to
                    the negotiating table and resulted in the POWs release and salvation. McCain
                    said that the first bombs hit late at night, without warning, near the prison
                    and shook it severely. Their cells lit up like mid-day and they all cheered and
                    screamed, certain that we had dropped nuclear weapons on Hanoi, though they
                    would have died from the effects.</p>
                <p>The class was naturally reluctant to ask many questions about their imprisonment,
                    though the eight encouraged us to do so. Finally, at the end of the year, they
                    got the commander's approval for a day of special lectures which they gave the
                    title, “Vietnam: A Beginning Assessment.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they talked about their experiences?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: Not only just those. They all had strong opinions about the way our
                    participation in the Vietnam conflict had been managed both in Washington and in
                    the field. They were very knowledgeable in their criticism and didn't pull any
                    punches.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you travel with any of the ex-POWs?</p>
                <p>TULL: I elected to take the African trip and I recall that most of them went to
                    the Middle East. You'll recall the 1973 Yom Kippur War had only ended a few
                    months earlier. The night before the Middle East group was due to leave Cairo,
                    President Sadat asked them to delay and meet with him. After meeting in his
                    office the next day, Sadat decided to take the members on a personal tour of the
                    Sinai battlefield, so off they went to the Suez Canal!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To what extent have you kept in touch with your National
                        WaCollege class?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: That particular group, the class of '74, fragmented quickly upon graduation
                    and never has really gotten together again. I see a few of the civilian members
                    every now and again.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TULL: Yes, that was a particularly interesting but painful year for him. After he
                    bailed out of his plane, he landed in the Hanoi equivalent of our reflecting
                    pool and broke about every bone on the left side of his body. He claimed his
                    year of therapy in Alexandria with a private physical therapist was more painful
                    than anything his Vietnamese captors thought up, but by July 1974, he was
                    walking without crutch or cane, had gotten back his pilot's status, and was
                    assigned as commander of a fighter squadron in Florida. All of these were men of
                    tremendous will and determination.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Q: Where did you go from Fort McNair?</p>
                <p>TULL: I had hoped for an assignment to head the small politico-military affairs
                    office in the Latin American bureau. It seemed fairly logical after Montevideo
                    and the War College. But then Mr. Kissinger's new Global Outlook Policy (GLOP)
                    was announced, apparently aimed at broadening officer expertise by assignments
                    to wholly new fields outside of one's experience. It was clear that this policy
                    had succeeded brilliantly in my own case when I arrived in the Bureau of
                    Personnel.</p>
                <p>Q: So you went to the Personnel, but you were still involved with Latin America
                    as head of the assignments branch for that bureau. Anything in particular from
                    that first exposure to personnel?</p>
                <p>TULL: Another world with its own arcane rules, but it turned out for the best. I
                    had already begun to think about how to prepare myself for deputy chief of
                    mission jobs, and naturally, keeping a post's vacancies filled, evaluating job
                    needs versus employee skills and counseling officers about their career futures,
                    are all part of a DCM's job. So this was an excellent start for what was to
                    come.</p>

                </p>
                <p>TULL: I still had two years of Washington duty to finish, and I continued to
                    think about how I could get ready for a management job in the field. So I sought
                    and got the position of deputy in Executive Director Joan Clark's office in the
                    European bureau.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>Q: The Executive Office of a regional bureau provides administrative and
                    management support both for the bureau's Washington headquarters and its
                    overseas posts. Joan was a very experienced senior officer and went on to a
                    number of other top jobs.</p>
                <p>TULL: Yes, she was an assistant secretary, director general of the Foreign
                    Service, and held several other key positions. Q: Other than your time in
                    Personnel, was this the first time you had been exposed to budget and other
                    kinds of administrative work?</p>
                <p>TULL: Effectively yes. My first tour had been as a post management officer, but
                    at the EUR/EX (European Exchange) level, it was basically all new. Joan was
                    extremely thorough and as a teacher, comprehensive and detailed if not always
                    wholly patient. She simply knew so much more and could do everything so much
                    better than anyone around her.</p>
                <p>Q: You started there in the summer of 1976. The Cold War of course was still on
                    and a lot of things were going on in Europe. Were there many problems at that
                    point with the support and backstopping of our embassy in Moscow?</p>
                <p>TULL: We and the Soviets were beginning to discuss a potential chancery and
                    residence building program there and of course we had concerns over the
                    potential serious health problems which the Russians might cause by their high
                    voltage bugging and jamming devices. Their continued insistence, as with other
                    bloc nations, on our dealing with their foreign ministry second-hand via a
                    “diplomatic service bureau” greatly complicated our logistical supply program,
                    but this had been going on for many years. Joan left the office on rotation
                    after a year and was replaced by Don Lidel, who I count as a good friend and
                    from whom I learned a great deal, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And from EUR/EX you went abroad?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: Yes, Ambassador Robert Yost was just finishing up his tour as a senior
                    inspector and had been named as chief of mission to the Dominican Republic. I
                    had put my name out and was lucky enough to be selected by him as his DCM. I was
                    particularly fortunate as Bob himself had had several DCM-ships- with his
                    experience as senior inspector, I really received comprehensive training in a
                    lot of very basic areas with any No. 2 must have.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He did not have experience or background in Latin
                        Americaaffairs, did he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: No, he had earlier been our ambassador in Rwanda and hasubstantial African
                    and European experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you prepare yourself for this assignment? You
                        haSpanish. Did you go to the DCM course?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: Yes, and it was a very good one- two weeks in the Virginia countryside with
                    nothing else to do but plan and study for the job ahead. I also took some
                    Spanish brush-up. Language does not come easy to me and it had been five years
                    since I left Montevideo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went down to Santo Domingo about the same time
                        aAmbassador Yost?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: Yes, we both arrived in August, 1978, just a few days before Antonio Guzm�n
                    Fernandez was inaugurated president of the Republic. He was the leader of the
                    Dominican Revolutionary Party, the PRD, with which we had not had a very happy
                    relationship. In 1965, President Lyndon Johnson, claiming the country might
                    become “another Cuba” if the PRD succeeded in ousting the existing military
                    government, ordered American forces to intervene. Our 101st Airborne Division
                    fought several pitched battles in the streets of downtown Santo Domingo against
                    determined PRD forces. So I anticipated a touchy “getting to know you” period.
                    But the PRD went forward without a frown or grimace and we got along just
                    fine.</p>
                <p>Q: Do you think that this was due to the Carter administration? That it made a
                    difference in terms of their perception of our attitude toward them?</p>
                <p>TULL: Absolutely; in fact they had just had a graphic illustration of this. A
                    short time before we were to leave for Santo Domingo, some elements in the
                    Dominican army tried to intervene and halt the election vote count as they had
                    done so many times before. Via the CAS and directly, we really raised unshirted
                    hell about this, the military backed down and the voting proceeded, sealing
                    Guzm�n's victory. I'm certain this blotted out or at least dimmed some of the
                    bitter memories of 1965.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we hold back in terms of aid to see what their
                        reactionwould be?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: No, the USG already had a fairly substantial AID program up and running
                    when we arrived, and a small military assistance program, too. If anything,
                    these increased in the first year. Then in August 1979, hurricanes “David” and
                    “Frederick” struck within a week of each other. Disaster relief grew enormously,
                    and this went on for another twelve to fifteen months. So we certainly supported
                    them as best we could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there was a great deal of damage from the
                        hurricanes?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>TULL: The destruction was tremendous. The “eye” of David passed about twenty
                    miles west of Santo Domingo and both the city and the countryside were
                    devastated. They stopped counting the dead at 2,000- electric power was not
                    returned in Santo Domingo until November, and there were many more months ahead
                    of black-outs in the campo. Winds were 140-150 miles per hour, and stripped the
                    land bare. Our house was on a small rise about a mile or so from the ocean- when
                    David finally moved on, we had a broad ocean view!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of assistance were we giving? Relief or
                        reconstruction?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: While I was there, it was mostly immediate reliefood and medicine
                    initially, then temporary shelter as quickly as we could. The hardship was
                    awful. But there was no looting. When relief supplies started to pile up, our
                    AID director sent two of his drivers out to see if any was reaching the “black
                    market,” if they could purchase any on the street. They never could, not once,
                    and Santo Domingo is a city crowded with poor even in good times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Besides disaster relief, what other types of things was
                        our AImission engaged in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: The same kinds of programs found at any AID mission- basic human need
                    goals: health, education, agricultural assistance, some financial assistance
                    mostly in the form of loans, and maternal child care. As I mentioned, we also
                    had a modest military assistance effort- again, mainly loans and training, no
                    MAP (Military Assistance Program), plus a full array of the other USG agencies
                    which are part of most embassies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Peace Corps?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: Yes, I recall we had about 100 volunteers, mostly stationed osmall
                    agricultural projects in the west near the Haitian border.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the border with Haiti closed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: In a strict sense, no. The ambassador made one trip over and back, but
                    permission signed personally by both presidents had to be obtained first. I
                    don't know of anyone else who undertook this, but there was a large amount of
                    illegal contraband of all types moving across the border daily.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But there have been times when the border was sealed and
                        almosnothing moved.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>TULL: Yes, during frequent periods of tension between the two. There is a long
                    and bloody history between Haiti and the Dominican Republic. In 1937, the
                    dictator Trujillo had 17-20,000 Haitian cane cutters massacred for encroaching
                    on the border and in colonial times, Haiti invaded the Dominican Republic twice.
                    Relations were always a little nervous.</p>
                <p>Q: The Dominican Republic, in terms of its foreign relations, always looked to
                    the U.S. quite a bit. What sort of relations did it have with Cuba?</p>
                <p>TULL: The PRD was a member of the Socialist International (SI) and its secretary
                    general, Jose Francisco Pe�a Gomez, was head of SI's Latin American office; so
                    they did have frequent contacts with Cuba, the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua at
                    that time, and other parties we were not particularly happy with. Frictions
                    arose from time to time, but these never became a major factor in our relations
                    with the Guzm�n government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned Trujillo. He left in the early '60s prior to
                        thU.S. intervention?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: He left feet first- assassinated in 1961. We had broken relations a year
                    earlier, but maintained consular ties and a consulate general, headed by Henry
                    Dearborn who you'll recall was my DCM in Colombia and had gotten me my job in
                    London. We were very active in the movement to oust Trujillo and in fact, had,
                    via the consulate general, provided the weapons that eventually were used to
                    kill him. I have always felt- and this is strictly personal- that Henry never
                    received the ambassadorship he deserved as neither the Kennedy not Johnson
                    administrations wanted to expose him in confirmation hearings to questioning
                    about this. It was several years later during hearings that Senator Frank Church
                    held that the full story of our role in Trujillo's death was finally revealed.
                    Even twenty years after his death, when Trujillo's name would come up,
                    Dominicans would all begin to speak in hushed voices and cast furtive glances
                    around.</p>
                <p>Q: At the time you were there, there was a large Dominican community in this
                    country. Was there a lot of pressure on the embassy for visas?</p>
                <p>TULL: Enormous pressure, every day and at every social function. The early
                    morning crowds on the visa line were huge; one of our busiest consular offices
                    was out fraud unit. We even had a former U.S. ambassador to the Dominican
                    Republic hustling visas for a group of Chinese and Dominican businessmen. Yost
                    had to call him in and warn him not to use his courtesy diplomatic passport to
                    clear them and their luggage through customs!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a large American community in the Dominican
                        Republic?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>TULL: I'd estimate the business community at around 300-400 in Santo Domingo
                    proper, with an Alcoa plant and a number of off-shore textile factories
                    scattered about in the countryside.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, there are a special category of Dominicans that
                        comto the United States: the baseball players.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: And there are a host of these, especially from the small village of San
                    Pedro de Macor�s, about thirty miles east of Santo Domingo. In a baseball-mad
                    country, in Macor�s they are particularly mad. It is a grubby little town,
                    distinguished only by the mansions which hometown boys now in the Major Leagues
                    build for themselves and their families. The game was introduced by our military
                    during the early days of the 20th century and the Dominican Republic, along with
                    Puerto Rico, Venezuela, and some other Central American countries, have a winter
                    Caribbean League in which some American players and managers participate in our
                    off-season. My team was the “Aguilas,” or Eagles, which Tommy Lasorda of Dodger
                    fame managed for a couple of seasons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have quite a bit of contact with President Guzm�n
                        and hitop people, or did the ambassador do that himself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: Early on, we decided to split the contact work as follows: the ambassador
                    would take the president, vice president, cabinet officers, and military chiefs;
                    I would do the rest. This of course was not “hard and fast” and looking back, I
                    think our convenience played a big role too. I knew the president and his family
                    pretty well and never felt constricted in my work. Guzm�n and his PRD group were
                    bright and eager to succeed, although I understand that later on, the old
                    Dominican bugaboo, corruption, really got out of control. Tragically, Guzm�n
                    committed suicide a few days before the end of his term because of corruption
                    charges against members of his family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go at the end of your tour in Santo Domingo
                        in 1981?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: I left the Dominican Republic in July without an onward assignment. In the
                    course of my consultations in Washington, I ran across Ray Ewing. He had just
                    been named as ambassador to Cyprus and was looking for a DCM. Events took their
                    course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I should emphasize that I had known you before when you
                        werdeputy director in the European bureau's executive office.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>TULL: Yes, and during my tour there you had been director of the office of
                    southern European affairs, then deputy assistant secretary in the bureau.</p>
                <p>Q: So, we had known each other before. And as someone who had never served as a
                    deputy chief of mission, I thought that I probably ought to have a DCM who knew
                    a little bit about what that job was all about.</p>
                <p>TULL: I recall when we first talked about this, I told you, “Ray, I don't know
                    anything about Cyprus at all.” After all the years you spent on
                    Greece-Turkey-Cyprus problems, you replied something to the effect that you
                    really weren't looking for another Cyprus expert! So we arrived in Nicosia in
                    September 1981 while Jack Eaves was in charge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was October when we arrived. And you did get to know
                        somethinabout Cyprus over the next three years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: Yes, it was impossible to live and work on that little island for any time
                    and not come to know quite a bit about the “national problem,” as some Greek
                    Cypriots called it. Basically, a serious NATO problem, arising out of the
                    collision of Greek and Turkish national interests which finally resulted in the
                    1974 Turkish invasion and the division of the island. For me, it was a
                    refreshing issue- at last, I didn't have to deal with development economics and
                    all its social and political problems which are so central in Latin American
                    countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But we stilhad an AID assistance program although it was
                        aunusual one.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: Really unique in my experience. Partially run by our single economic
                    officer but basically administered by the representative of the UN high
                    commissioner for refugees because he had easy access to both the Greek Cypriot
                    and Turkish Cypriot communities.</p>
                <p>Q: But there was a very strong internal political rationale in the U.S. for the
                    program, as well as a foreign policy justification in demonstrating our
                    continuing interest in the Cyprus issue.</p>

                <p>TULL: True, but I have always felt that the fifteen million dollars which
                    Congress appropriated every year with no request from the Administration was a
                    kind of payoff to powerful Greek lobby groups on the Hill, such as AHEPA
                    (American Hellenic Educational Foundation) and others. I recall that while you
                    were on home leave in 1983, we finally succeeded after years of trying, in
                    getting a congressional delegation to some out and see what their fifteen
                    million a year in refugee aid was buying. And it was an important group-
                    Chairman “Doc” Long of Maryland and his house appropriations subcommittee. We
                    took him to several projects in Larnaca which had been constructed with U.S.
                    funds for the Greek Cypriot refugees from the 1974 invasion, including a
                    hospital and housing project. Apartments at the latter were large and
                    well-appointed. Long asked our Greek Cypriot guide what monthly rent was charged
                    on the largest of these; the guide looked surprised and said, “They're for
                    refugees so of course they are free.” It was Long's turn to be surprised and
                    several times in the next couple of days he mused about “...those free
                    apartments we built which are a heck of a lot better than the places my
                    constituents in Baltimore live in.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't you mention some of the other significant issues
                        witwhich we had to deal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: Of course there was the Fulbright program which Dan Howard, head of USIS,
                    had a major role in guiding. It was, I believe, the only remaining bicommunal
                    activity left on the island, at least one of the very few.</p>
                <p>Q: And it was funded under this fifteen million dollar refugee assistance granthe
                    Cyprus-American Scholarship Program- as well as from the traditional Fulbright
                    program. The two were combined to some extent.</p>
                <p>TULL: It was one of those rare occasions when both the Greek Cypriots and Turkish
                    Cypriots voluntarily sat down together- on “neutral ground” at the old Ledra
                    Hotel- and actually worked out something with an agreed result. It says
                    something about both communities that the opportunity for scholarships for their
                    children overcame, in this one instance, their mutual suspicions and hatred of
                    each other. But far more important was our work with the special representative
                    of the UN secretary general who was working on behalf of the SYG (Secretary
                    General) to promote a peaceful reuniting of the two communities, separated along
                    the Green Line since the civil war and Turkish invasion of 1974.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, it was Hugo Gobbi, an Argentine from their diplomatic service who had
                    most recently been Argentine ambassador to Spain. I think you knew him well, but
                    you also knew his deputy, Jim Holger.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>TULL: Yes, Jim was a Chilean who had left their diplomatic service when General
                    Pinochet took power. He was my opposite number in Ambassador Gobbi's office, so
                    he and I were particularly close. When democracy was re-established in Chile, he
                    resumed his career and I believe went on to become Chilean ambassador to the
                    Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>Q: Shall we also say anything about our relations with the British high
                    commission? We spent a fair amount of time with them, partly because the United
                    Kingdom has a long and special relationship with Cyprus historically, first as
                    its colonial ruler and then with independence as a guarantor power. The United
                    Kingdom also retains two major military sovereign base areas on the southern
                    coast at Akrotiri and Dhekelia.</p>
                <p>TULL: I can't recall any other time in my career when we were so close in our
                    working relationship with another mission as we were with High Commissioner John
                    Wilberforce and his deputy David Dain. David and I literally worked out of each
                    other's files and I doubt that either Washington or London had any idea how
                    closely we coordinated and cooperated. And of course it was our exchanges with
                    Hugo and Jim on a very quiet basis which made it all possible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you recall any signs of progress in this dispute that
                        mighhave taken place in the period that you were there, 1981-1984?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: Sadly, no. I have no information on the current state of play between the
                    two communities, but I doubt that they are any closer today than the day you and
                    I arrived. This was after all a civil war of the most savage and brutal kind,
                    topped by foreign invasion. The leaders now on the scene went through all of
                    that and if it's possible for any of them to forgive, I doubt that a single one
                    can now forget.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't you say a few words about the structure of our
                        embassin Nicosia? Among other things we had a defense office and
                        attache.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>TULL: First of all, it was a very small mission. We had a Greek-language officer
                    who was in charge of the political section plus a Turkish-language officer; a
                    single economic officer and sole consular officer and two Americans in the
                    administrative section, an administrative officer, and general services officer.
                    Our accounting was basically handled by Cypriot employees. I've mentioned we had
                    an American head of USIS. Out largest single American component might have been
                    in the office of the Foreign Broadcast Information Servic(FBIS). FBIS is
                    essentially an unclassified radio monitoring service and with Cyprus' position
                    next to the Middle East, it was an important listening post for the USG. And of
                    course our defense attache's office headed at that time by LTC (Lieutenant
                    Colonel) Dick McCall. He had the unenviable task of trying to handle both the
                    Greek and the Turkish languages. His grasp of the latter appeared to cause a bit
                    of mirth among Turkish military officers, but Dick was no fool and made certain
                    that he ended every speech in Turkish with, “And we must never forget the words
                    of the immortal Attaturk, 'Peace at home, peace in the world!'" This invariably
                    evoked cheers and applause.</p>
                <p>Q: I think we also ought to mention security. Roger Davies, our ambassador in
                    1974, had been assassinated and our regional security officer had important
                    responsibilities for the protection of all of us.</p>
                <p>TULL: Yes, our security problems were not of the direct kind that I saw at my
                    next two posts, but rather more of an offshore variety. Cyprus had the
                    reputation as a “neutral” area in the Middle East, so all sides seem to show up
                    here. I remember one rumor that had several members of the Japanese Red Army
                    holed up here for awhile!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We also had a small office on the Turkish Cypriot side of
                        Nicosia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: Yes, we had three Turkish Cypriot employees representing us in that
                    community. They performed some limited consular and information services for us,
                    as well as a large amount of contact and representational duties in their
                    community. The senior of these who was in charge was Doghan Taskan, who set up
                    this small office in the garage behind his home in Nicosia. Doghan knew everyone
                    on the Turkish Cypriot side from “President” Rauf Denktash on down; he was the
                    one we would go to first on any matter involving his community.</p>
                <p>Q: He did a daily summary of the Turkish press and worked closely with our
                    Turkish- language political officer at the embassy. He also had one of the few
                    direct telephone connections across the Green Line, which divided the
                    communities.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>TULL: Yes. I believe all or most other lines went through Denktash's office. As
                    an example of the work Doghan did for us, we faced numerous complaints from both
                    the Greek Cypriots and pro-Greek lobby groups at home about alleged enormous
                    poppy fields in the Turkish-controlled area and significant drug activities
                    there. Unfortunately, our DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency) officer was of Greek
                    ethnic origin which made contact nearly impossible. But finally after a great
                    deal of delicate negotiation, Doghan succeeded in arranging a meeting for me and
                    the DEA officer with in effect the narcotics control officer of the Turkish army
                    in Cyprus. Our meeting was perfectly friendly and it at least enabled us to
                    assure all concerned that we were in productive contact with the relevant
                    Turkish authorities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Cyprus, our narcotics interest was party on the island
                        our alsin Lebanon and Greece.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: Cyprus was more important as a potential transhipment point from Syria and
                    the Bekaa Valley of Lebanon than as a growing area. At the time we were there, I
                    don't believe there was much flowing through, although we always suspected there
                    might be more than we guessed.</p>
                <p>Q: When the Israelis invaded Beirut in 1982, there were lots of things that
                    impacted us in Cyprus- the evacuation of the PLO to Tunis, the earlier bombings
                    of our embassy and then the marines, plus the two evacuations of Americans from
                    there, too. What do you recall of that period?</p>
                <p>TULL: I don't think I'll ever forget how the British reacted to the attack on our
                    marine contingent. Even before we could request it, they had a medical transport
                    plane in Beirut with doctors and emergency personnel. They loaded it to the
                    gills and brought all the wounded back to the Princess Anne hospital at their
                    Akrotiri sovereign base area. I think all of this happened before our own
                    evacuation to Germany could take place. We lost only one marine from that group.
                    I always felt it was a marvelous thing for them to have done. The evacuations of
                    Americans from Beirut were unusual because they were basically handled in the
                    port of Larnaca by our wives and kids and embassy employees receiving the
                    refugees. And then Larnaca airport or at least a part of it became our
                    helicopter staging area in and out of Beirut when its airport was shut down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember much about the arrangements we had to make
                        fothose helicopters to move back and forth? It went on for some time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>TULL: Naturally, it could only have been done with the full cooperation of the
                    GOC. But sensitive to their neutral, “non-aligned” status, I recall them making
                    clear to you that it had to be done quietlyand without undue attention. And
                    amazingly it was- we had a full ground crew to service our group of about a
                    dozen aircraft under pretty close scrutiny by the Cypriots, and brought it all
                    off without major incident.</p>
                <p>Q: One of the things that has developed since we were there is that the current
                    Greek Cypriot president is Glafkos Clerides, who in our time was an opposition
                    leader in the Parliament of some structure and influence, but still on the outs
                    with everyone in the government.</p>
                <p>TULL: Interestingly, he was the only Greek Cypriot that I can recall who Turkish
                    Cypriot leader Denktash ever spoke well of. He once told me, “Glafkos is a man I
                    can trust. He is a man of his word and I could work with him.” I don't think he
                    was, but they do go back a long ways together, to their days as student lawyers
                    at Greys Inn in London. Glafkos, for his part, claimed that Denktash couldn't
                    hold his beer and that often he would have to carry him back to his digs after a
                    night of pubbing.</p>
                <p>Q: You met with Denktash yourself on a number of occasions when I was tied up or
                    away. Why don't you talk a bit more about your appreciation of him and also how
                    you worked on the Turkish Cypriot side of Cyprus?</p>
                <p>TULL: The vice president of Uruguay, a man of Lebanese descent, named Alberto
                    Abdala, is the only politician I have known even remotely similar to Rauf
                    Denktash in cleverness, deviousness, and crafty skills. I was never quite
                    certain of his goals or who he trusted. He was his own party and it was the
                    majority one in his community. With Louis XIV, he too could say, “I am the
                    state.” He had several times been elected president of the Turkish Cypriot
                    community, but he could go no higher, so I never believed he would be a willing
                    partner to anything but the weakest possible confederation of the two
                    communities which he would co-head. Personally, I found him agreeable and
                    affable and delighted with jokes at others expenses.</p>
                <p>Much of my official dealings in the north were with Denktash's “foreign
                    minister,” Kenan Atakol, a youngish, well-schooled, and highly intelligent
                    lawyer who I found unfailingly friendly and helpful. Another major force in that
                    community was Turkey, with whose ambassador and embassy we enjoyed cordial
                    relations and with whose army of about 35,000 we had little contact.</p>
                <p>Q: When Denktash and the Turkish Cypriots declared the independence or their
                    community as the “Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus,” do you recall whether or
                    not that was a surprise for us?</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>TULL: Yes, there is no way around it, this particular timing was a surprise. We
                    had no advance warning of any kind, although it was a move Denktash had been
                    threatening for some time, claiming “We might have to do this to be taken
                    seriously by others.” When we told him the USG would not recognize any such
                    “state,” he would shrug and reply, “Well, you refused to recognize Communist
                    China for twenty-five years, but eventually you came around. We are prepared to
                    wait you out, too.”</p>
                <p>Q: After that, the United States condemned this action, supported a resolution in
                    the U.S. Security Council deploring it, and discouraged other countries from
                    recognizing it. But on the island of Cyprus, we took the position that nothing
                    had changed.</p>
                <p>TULL: And really nothing had. Turkey of course recognized the new “TRNC” (Turkish
                    Republic of Northern Cyprus) while everyone else ignored it; the border across
                    the Green Line reopened within a day, and life went on as before. The Greek
                    Cypriots were naturally very upset and I think they would have liked us to be
                    more so too. But our feeling was that we still had business to do with the
                    Turkish Cypriots and that we also had not given up on Ambassador Gobbi's
                    intercommunal talks and hopes for some progress toward settlement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe we should say a few words about our physical
                        facilities anour thinking about a future new building.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: We basically had our main offices and your residence in two decrepit old
                    three- story apartment buildings which were still standing only because they
                    were leaning on each other for support. It was a GSO's nightmare. Toward the end
                    of our tours, the Kiko Monastery of the Cypriot Orthodox Church agreed to give
                    us a long-term lease on a several-acre olive grove behind their abbey in
                    Nicosia's western suburb. You remember the lease signing ceremony at your
                    residence. The abbot and his officials each signed, then reached in their
                    cassocks and pulled out a piece of a seal- I recall it was in seven pieces. The
                    abbot then put them together in some kind of a screw handle, inked and sealed
                    the document, then unscrewed the pieces, and returned each to its owner. I take
                    it this made the lease legal in the sight of God as well as man!</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you learned a lot more about the Cyprus issue

                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>TULL: Yes indeed, but there was sadness, too. I wish we, or someone, could
                    somehow do more to help them reunite than we've found possible so far. But the
                    horrors of civil war won't fade for many years- some, it seems, are trying to
                    prevent this from ever happening. You'll recall the priest who headed the Greek
                    Cypriot refugee organization, Papa Cristophoru. He never lost an opportunity to
                    keep the bloody wounds of remembrance open and flowing among those in his
                    community who had lost family or loved ones; for his part, Denktash never failed
                    to encourage visitors to stop by a small house near his office which had been
                    converted into something called “The Museum of Savagery.” There one sad large
                    black and white atrocity photos of Turkish Cypriot babies bayoneted and torn to
                    shreds, women grossly abused and murdered, and piles of males machine gunned and
                    butchered. That remains an enormous impediment to any reunion of the
                    Cypriots.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go from Cyprus?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: To Bogota, back to Colombia but this time as DCM. Our ambassador there was
                    Lewis Tambs, a professor of Latin American history at Arizona State University
                    in Phoenix who had been active in the Republican party and appointed by
                    President Reagan about two years earlier. His deputy was Alec Watson, who had
                    just been named ambassador to Brazil. We did not know each other, but Tambs
                    selected me and we arrived in Bogota in July, 1984. In the twenty years since we
                    left Colombia, two major new issues had arisen: the first was the rise of the
                    leftist guerrilla groups from a scattering of ex-bandits and disaffected
                    university youths to well-organized and armed rural militia of several thousand
                    whose skilled leadership usually enabled them to emerge the winner in any of
                    their frequent firefights with the police or Colombian army units; the second
                    was the even more spectacular rise of the major drug lords such as Pablo Escobar
                    and Carlos Lederer and their international narcotics cartels. Worse still, about
                    the time we arrived, a symbiotic relationship was developing between the two,
                    with the guerrillas providing protection for drug laboratories while Escobar and
                    his like paid huge sums of money which bought them arms and equipment.</p>
                <p>In Washington, too, the “War on Drugs” was in full bloom and focused on Colombia
                    as the main supplier of illegal narcotics to this country. For his part,
                    Ambassador Tambs was determined not to fall prey to the intimidation the drug
                    dealers had used so successfully against their foes- rather, on every available
                    public and private occasion, he attacked them head on and personably. In
                    speeches and the media, he condemned their ruthless and bloodthirsty ways, he
                    ridiculed their attempts to appear “friends of the poor” by sponsoring youth
                    clubs and building soccer fields, and he demanded their extradition to the U.S.
                    to face persecution and “hard time” federal imprisonment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there threats against Ambassador Tambs?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>TULL: Yes, from DEA, police, and military sources we received almost daily
                    warnings of attempts against him. Terrorists- “narco-guerrillas” was the term he
                    coined for them- set one bomb off near his residence and a large car bomb next
                    to the embassy, fortunately without injuries to embassy personnel, but as all
                    too usual in these cases, with the death of one lady waiting outside the embassy
                    for a visa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we giving the Colombian government a lot of support
                        and helthen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: By that time we were doing a lot of intelligence coordination and
                    cooperation; material support especially for the police and Army was on the
                    rise. Years earlier, the government had decided it really did not need an
                    assistance program of any kind, so this had to be rebuilt from zero. But, in
                    addition, I personally believe that the ambassador's strong, “outfront” approach
                    helped a great deal. Until then, the narcos had the upper hand in the sense of
                    appearing unbeatable. He took them on fearlessly and even over the short time I
                    was there, I could see a stiffening of spine in the police, the ministry of
                    justice, parts of the media, and in the presidency. Certainly President
                    Belisario Betanour, who became a good friend of Tambs, changed from a fairly
                    wishy-washy figure on this issue to one who led the fight for the first
                    successful extradition of one of Escobar's top lieutenants in the Medellin
                    cartel. But it was a dangerous tactic and ultimately his security situation
                    became so difficult that Washington ordered him and his family back to the
                    States in December, 1984.</p>
                <p>Q: You were in charge of the embassy from that point until you left the following
                    summer. Were there a lot of threats against you? You had less visibility.</p>
                <p>TULL: I can't say that I was ever targeted personally in the way the ambassador
                    was. But as we learned in Montevideo with soils specialist Claude Fly, the
                    kidnaping or murder of one American can cause about as much difficulty as
                    another, so we took very careful precautions. Still today, when I'm driving and
                    hear a motorcycle pulling up behind me, I take a pretty close look. That was a
                    standard assassination method in Colombia- a masked shooter on the back of a
                    motorbike.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were your wives and families able to stay on there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>TULL: Only those without dependent children. Shortly after the ambassador left,
                    DEA picked up some intelligence to the effect that the narcos, frustrated by our
                    security measures and armed personnel convoys, were beginning to discuss plans
                    to attack the Abraham Lincoln International school, which most of our children
                    attended, and take hostages. I knew we must head off any possibility of that, so
                    over the 1964-645 Christmas break, we very quietly moved the kids back to the
                    U.S. as well as any parents who wanted to accompany them. At the same time, I
                    was glad some wives and “babes- in-arms” mothers decided to stay on- I
                    remembered from our time in Cyprus that a whole- sale Beirut style evacuation of
                    dependents can result in a lot of morale problems. I thought if we could keep at
                    least a semblance of community life, it would be easier on all; it seemed to
                    have turned out that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The DEA was an important part of the embassy staff. Were
                        thekind of off on their own?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: When I arrived, they had offices across the street from the chancery. But
                    after the car bomb, others in their building grew so nervous about them being
                    there that we decided it best to move them into our spaces, so we reconfigured
                    the vacant garage into offices. And you're 100% right, they were a vital part of
                    the embassy and it was a very dangerous assignment for the dozen or so agents
                    stationed there.</p>
                <p>Q: Anything else about Colombia?</p>
                <p>TULL: Only to say that despite it all, we still were able to keep all the usual
                    activities which were important to both Colombia and the U.S. moving along at a
                    pretty normal pace, especially in the trade and commercial areas. The embassy
                    staff was a very strong and resilient group, the kind one needs close by in such
                    situations. Even when we had to send a third of them home, the remainder never
                    missed a beat. Afterwards, Tambs always referred to them as “Los Valientes,” the
                    Brave Ones.</p>

                <p>TULL: Yes, I had thought that his leave of absence was nearly over and that he
                    would be returning to Arizona State- it was important for him to retain tenure
                    there as someone with a large family and fairly modest means. However, the
                    Reagan administration wanted him in Central America so he was given an extension
                    and he asked us to come with him.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were a lot of things going on with regard to Costa
                        Rica anneighboring Nicaragua at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: Yes and most of these had to do with our support for the Contra forces
                    which went on until the fall of 1986. I should say at the outset that the names
                    and programs involved in this- once very highly classified- are now in the
                    public record, so I'm breaking no confidences. We arrived in San Jose directly
                    from Bogota in early July, 1985, followed by the ambassador and his family about
                    a month later. Within a day or two, he summoned Joe Fernandez, our station
                    chief, LTC John Lent, our Army attache who had just arrived from Nicaragua, and
                    me, to his home. He said at one of his final briefings at the White House, LTC
                    Oliver North of the National Security counsel had told him to give high priority
                    in Costa Rica to finding ways to support the armed opposition group, the
                    “Contras,” then fighting the communist Sandinista government in Nicaragua. Tambs
                    also said this instruction was repeated to him by his assistant secretary,
                    Elliot Abrams, at the State Department.</p>
                <p>We had been sending assistance of all kinds to the Contras since 1981, but in
                    mid-1984, congressional opposition had resulted in the Boland Amendment to the
                    Foreign Assistance Act, which in effect made such aid illegal. The ambassador
                    went on to say that opposition to Contra aid in Congress was very strong and
                    that we therefore had to hold this instruction and any actions we took from it
                    very closely. Even then he expected leaks and a firestorm of criticism to occur-
                    therefore knowledge of this was restricted to the four of us to protect other
                    embassy employees when the inevitable occurred.</p>
                <p>At that time, the Costa Rican government of President Alberto Monge was in an
                    uproar over Sandinista military incursions into northern Costa Rica and the
                    deaths of several of their policemen. There were no Contra effectives inside the
                    southern part of Nicaragua then, nor did we have any support programs except for
                    debriefing stations for fleeing Nicaraguan dissents and troops. I did not
                    realize then that it was Washington's intention to retain all initiative and
                    control of USG aid to the Contras tightly in its own hands.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they in effect were running the whole show. You
                        mentioned thNSC and State- where else was this control lodged?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>TULL: Operationally, almost everything went in and out of the agency's Central
                    American task force headed by Allen Fiers. For us, north, Abrams and Fiers were
                    central, the “Anillo” (the ring) we called them. Of course others were involved
                    too- the president even proclaimed himself a “Contra” at one point; bud
                    McFarlane as NSC director, later Admiral John Poindexter, Richard Armitage at
                    defense, Otto Reich of Abrams' office of public policy at State, retired Air
                    Force General Secord, and others. But for us it was these three. Because we
                    never knew for certain which of our visitors knew what, we never could volunteer
                    any briefings ourselves. This led to some awkward moments- for instance, our
                    Foreign Service inspectors arrived but never had a clue as to our principal
                    substantive effort; NSC (National Security Council) members from outside North's
                    staff clearly knew things were happening but not what and we stayed mute;
                    congressional staffers regularly visited with questions we would not answer;
                    and, most painful to me, even Ambassador Phil Habib, who the president had
                    appointed as his special envoy to Central America, visited San Jose and other
                    capitals often but obviously had never been brought into the core of things by
                    Washington. It was difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what kinds of things were going on while you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: First, it is important to keep in mind that most Contra activity and
                    therefore support was going on along the Honduran border with northern
                    Nicaragua. There, one could talk about thousands of Contras; in southern
                    Nicaragua, the Contra forces of Pedro Chamorro at no time numbered above a few
                    hundred. They were, however, closer to Managua and in the area of the vital
                    Managua-Blue Fields port supply line. Out first effort was to try to reopen a
                    disused airfield in northern rural Costa Rica for use as an emergency refueling
                    site for charter aircraft making airdrops of food and supplies to Chamorro's
                    small forces. We also were involved in Washington's plans for a communications
                    intercept and eavesdropping facility to be jointly manned with Costa Rican
                    intelligence personnel, naturally directed at Nicaragua. Plus we shipped
                    medicine, food, and supplies to southern Contra forces whenever we could.</p>
                <p>Q: Let's talk a bit more about the embassy's relationship with Oscar Arias and
                    the political climate in Costa Rica. It's a unique country with no military
                    forces and such.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>TULL: Costa Rica indeed has a unique history in this area. It was settled not by
                    gold seekers or treasure hunters, but by Spanish farmers who brought their
                    families with them to live and work. The region also was quite isolated and
                    difficult to get to, so it grew up nearly self-governing from its beginning and
                    was really not part of the Spanish colonial administration which so influenced
                    the rest of the countries of this region. “Ticos,” as they call themselves, are
                    rather proud of the fact that their independence simply arrived in the mail when
                    the rest of Central America broke free; until then they hadn't noticed. So the
                    “Ticos” emerged as a hard working, successful people with a considerable history
                    of self government and a special pride in what they had been able to build and
                    accomplish, particularly when they saw the mess their neighbors had made of
                    their own histories and countries. Unfortunately, they are also convinced that
                    they have important lessons to teach others in the arts of living peacefully and
                    conflict resolution.</p>
                <p>In my experience, even more than Argentina, Costa Rica is a country whose people
                    are almost universally afflicted with the sin of overwhelming pride. Oscar Arias
                    is in this regard, for me, the archetypical symbol of Costa Rican hubris. He was
                    elected president to replace Monge in early 1975. He did not like our military
                    aid to the Contras and the resulting mini-war, and was firmly convinced that he
                    and other democratically-elected Central American presidents could exert
                    sufficient moral pressure and suasion on the Sandinistas to force them to accept
                    a democratic path. He was absolutely convinced he was right, the Reagan
                    administration was wrong, and he never hesitated to so inform us or his
                    visitors. Of course he was a hit with the president's congressional critics such
                    as democratic Senator Dodd and House Whip Bonnior. It became a bit of a straddle
                    for us, with Arias moralizing in one ear and Washington complaining about it in
                    the other. At the same time, our relations with the GOCR (Government Of Costa
                    Rica) remained good- we had a large and effective AID program, excellent USIS
                    cultural and information programs, good commercial relations, and a host of
                    American businessmen and retirees who were very happy to be there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the mission was able to do a lot of things while a few
                        of yowere involved with Nicaragua?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: Yes, we did get threats and one bomb exploding across from the embassy; we
                    also had a cadre of young Costa Ricans who had been given commando and terrorist
                    training in both Nicaragua and the Soviet Union- not a 100% friendly climate but
                    we got along pretty well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have to ask you whether or not Colonel North came down
                        to CostRica.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>TULL: Yes, but not frequently- twice, that I recall. CIA (Central Intelligence
                    Agency) Director Casey also made a brief, low-key visit in his C-5 aircraft that
                    seemed to take up a large part of San Jose's international airport; McFarlane
                    also came through, as did Admiral Poindexter just before the Iran-Contra crisis
                    broke, to exhort us all to keep up the good work and assure us that Washington
                    was fully behind us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then the storm broke-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: Yes, on November twenty-fifth, 1985, the attorney general announced that we
                    had indeed sold arms to Iran after all, and that we had used those monies, in
                    part, to finance assistance to the Contras. What a bombshell! The source of
                    Contra funding was perhaps a bigger shock to us then to anyone else- we thought
                    we knew all the secrets!</p>
                <p>Q: So, let me make certain I know why you were so upset about what flowed from
                    this announcement. Was it being involved in something you knew was not quite
                    right, or was it being abandoned by those you counted on?</p>
                <p>TULL: Certainly not the former- I was ready to do more than I was called upon to
                    do. The Boland amendments never caused me a moment of concern- since all the
                    controls were in the hands of Washington, I considered it to be Washington's
                    problem, not the field's. But the abandonment which occurred over the next few
                    months hurt. This is why the word “betrayal” comes to mind occasionally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: Of course Meese's announcement set off a terrific hullabaloo with the
                    president's critics crying, “Aha, as we've said all along, they've been breaking
                    the law by aiding the Contras,” just as Tambs had predicted earlier. As the
                    controversy rolled on, demands became louder for House and Senate hearings, then
                    the appointment of a special prosecutor, and then possibly fines, suspensions,
                    and even jail time for the guilty.</p>
                <p>Q: There were a lot of people at the embassy in San Jose who as you explained
                    were not aware of Contra aid efforts. How did they react when this news broke?
                    Would they have liked to have known what was going on?</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>TULL: Clearly no, in fact I think most were grateful to use the “deniability”
                    that the ambassador had arranged for them. They were careful not to get
                    crosswise with Abrams' leadership of the Latin American Bureau, and I later
                    heard some stories of animosity at post toward Tambs and me and others. But to
                    continue, as cries for punishment of those responsible became louder, we began
                    to hear mutterings of, “We didn't know anything about that,” or “We certainly
                    didn't authorize anything like that” on the part of some- but not all- those in
                    Washington who had been most insistent on retaining absolute control. At that
                    time at the end of December, the ambassador was about to depart to reclaim his
                    tenure ship, having been told to return or lose it. At the airport he predicted,
                    “Jim, you watch- pretty soon they won't even remember our names.” I shortly
                    found out just how true this was.</p>
                <p>Q: What happened then?</p>
                <p>TULL: In February, 1987, Abrams asked me to come back to Washington for a brief
                    consultation. We met in his office with his deputy, Bill Walker, and for an hour
                    talked about nearly everything except Central America. Finally as we stood to
                    leave, he said, “Well, Jim, this must be a rough time down there,” to which I
                    readily agreed. He went on, “I guess out of this has come a real lesson” and
                    wagging his finger at me, continued, “Don't do any more favors for the White
                    House!” This from one of The Ring!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were doing favors for the White House.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: Right. The few days I was in Washington I noticed that the word “rogue”
                    seemed to crop up in a number of “insider” newspaper stories, referring to the
                    actions of field personnel and posts in Central America. Anyway, I flew back to
                    San Jose and told my wife to start packing up as I didn't think we'd be there
                    much longer. A month later I received orders to leave. Later, back in the
                    Department, the climate again seemed a little cool in some- but again, not all-
                    quarters. For example, I was asked by staffers on the Senate Intelligence
                    Committee to come by and give some testimony under oath. When I called the legal
                    advisers office for guidance, what I got was brief and to the point: “Tell them
                    everything you know and if you think you need help, hire the best lawyer you can
                    afford.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything more to say about what probably was your
                        moschallenging and difficult assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>TULL: Not much. As the whole Iran-Contra business wore down, grants of immunity
                    and pardons seemed to be passed out fairly freely in Washington, but rarely in
                    the field. A few there were forced out of their agencies and other professional
                    reputations, if not damaged, were at least somewhat clouded. And finally, there
                    was a bit of irony at the end of it all; with the Contras in disarray, the
                    Sandinista regime of Daniel Ortega felt so supremely confident of their power
                    and control in Nicaragua that they decided to confront Arias's criticism of them
                    by calling for free, OAS (Organization of American States)-supervised national
                    elections. They were beaten so badly and clearly that they were forced to step
                    down. So a democratic government took office in Managua and shortly thereafter,
                    Oscar Arias was awarded the Nobel Prize for peace! A decade and a half later, I
                    imagine the words, “I told you so,” are still echoing around San Jose.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you came back for three more years with a Limited
                        CareeExtension given to you by Director General George Vest.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: Yes, and once again I went to work for you...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As Deputy Director of the Office of Foreign Service
                        CareeDevelopment and Assignments.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: I'm still surprised to recall how large that Division was, nearly 80, as I
                    remember it. I enjoyed this final assignment before retirement and I think it
                    helped that I had had some prior experience in the area. At least I was a little
                    familiar with our “Standard Operating Procedures” manual, about 3” thick I
                    recall, and assignment panel operations. Our people were great to work with as
                    was, of course, George Vest.</p>
                <p>Q: Basically, we tried to make the Foreign Service assignments and counsel system
                    work smoothly. It did not always operate very well in balancing the conflicting
                    desires of the individual and the needs of the Service.</p>
                <p>TULL: But I always felt it should have if our 6th and 7th Floor masters would
                    have let it alone. I'm convinced that the key to a successful system of that
                    kind rests on its complete openness and consistency. With those factors, it
                    should have been easy especially since of the 4,000 officers in the Service, we
                    only had to assign about 1,500 per year. Even with all of its then-current
                    faults, we generally had no more than 100 to 150 really difficult placement
                    problems, jobs or unplaceable people, in each annual cycle.</p>
                <p>Q: I would say at the time we had some really good people on our panels, doing
                    their best to represent both the posts and the individuals. They were an
                    absolutely essential part of the system.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>TULL: And since they knew they too would be returning to that systeat the end of
                    their tours, they wanted it to work equitably.</p>
                <p>I know the system gets a lot of criticism, but I still believe the answer is to
                    let it alone and insulate it from outside pressures and manipulation which tend
                    to pervert its balance and fairness. But this might be a very unrealistic
                    goal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a good statement to end on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TULL: Yes, I agree. This has been a good opportunity. Thank you.</p>
