                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is October 29, 2003. This is an interview with Joyce
                        E. Leader. This is being done on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic
                        Studies and Training and I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy. Do you go by
                        Joyce?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's start at the beginning. When and where were you
                        born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, November 16, 1942, but I grew up
                    in Cincinnati, Ohio.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell me a little about your parents on both
                        sides? Is Leader a married name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: That's my birth name.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did the Leaders come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: I'm told that Leader is a bastardization or an Anglicization of a German
                    name, Loeder or something like that. The family came to northern Ohio in the
                    mid-1800s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were they, farmers?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>LEADER: Yes, for the most part. My father was the youngest of five and the older
                    brothers went into farming. The husband of one sister worked on the railroad. My
                    father was sickly and couldn't go into farming. He went first to Columbus, Ohio
                    to work and then to Cincinnati to go to school. He got a degree in chemical
                    engineering.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From the University of Pittsburgh?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: From the University of Cincinnati. He had to work his way through with a
                    couple of jobs and study at the same time. His farm family had no money to send
                    him at all, so he was strictly on his own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he work for one of the big companies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: He moved to Morgantown, West Virginia, and then to Pittsburgh to work in
                    different companies, but I don't know much about that. He died when I was three.
                    I don't really have the story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your mother? What was her maiden name and where
                        did she come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: Her maiden name was Biechler. Her mother and father were from the general
                    Cincinnati/Indianapolis/Columbus, Ohio area. Her mother was valedictorian of her
                    high school class in Liberty, Indiana, a little tiny town in Indiana. But she
                    never went on to university or anything and wasn't employed during her lifetime.
                    Her father was a photographic equipment traveling salesman. This was during the
                    very early days of photography and he was with Eastman Kodak. So that's their
                    background.</p>
                <p>After my father died my mother went back to Cincinnati where her parents were,
                    where they had an apartment building. She went back with myself and my younger
                    sister and then got her advanced degrees for teaching. She went into
                    teaching.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You grew up in Cincinnati more or less?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Cincinnati like? You got there right after the
                        war. Where did you live in Cincinnati?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>LEADER: We lived very close to the University of Cincinnati in the area called
                    Clifton. I guess the area where I lived had a number of people who were somehow
                    affiliated with the university or some of the hospitals in the area near our
                    grade school. I had a rather quiet urban upbringing since Cincinnati wasn't very
                    plugged into the world in that time. That's my impression and my recollection.
                    When I was in the first grade, I had a young friend whose father was an exchange
                    teacher who went over to France. I was enthralled by the fact that she came back
                    saying that she could speak French and she could dream in French. This just
                    really intrigued me and I got interested even at that young age in international
                    things and tried always to read in the newspaper about what was going on in the
                    world. In Cincinnati at that time you really couldn't find very much
                    international news. We did have television though in my family by 1947. I
                    remember being let out of school in 1953 to see two things: the coronation of
                    Queen Elizabeth and the inauguration of President Eisenhower. So we did get to
                    see those things. I don't remember much talk about the McCarthy situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was family life like? Who brought you up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: We lived with my grandparents. My mother worked, so my grandmother had a
                    lot of the responsibility for driving us around when we were kids and taking us
                    to nursery school and making sure we got across the street on our way to grade
                    school and so forth. But my mother was very busy with her teaching. At one point
                    she wrote a health book. My mother was actually a physical education teacher, so
                    every summer after we got to be about seven years old, we started going to
                    summer camps. She would be the waterfront counselor and we were campers. This
                    gave us a lot of exposure to other people and to sports and the lake and all of
                    these kinds of activities. That was just part of our experiences.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At home, was there much talk about world events?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: I can't say here what I remember about that because it was very
                    derogatory about some of the leaders of that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did your family fall in the political spectrum?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: Pretty much in the Republican side. Cincinnati was William Howard Taft
                    country. It was a very Republican town.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In school as a kid, in elementary school, were there any
                        subjects you were particularly interested in or good in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>LEADER: Again, I was always intrigued with these things that were sort of
                    overseas kinds of things. But I really can't remember too much about
                    specifics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about reading?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: I used to read biographies. I remember being very fascinated with them. I
                    don't remember a whole lot about them, but I read a lot of biographies of
                    American leaders: George Washington, Jefferson, all of those people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you call yourself a reader? Some kids are real
                        readers and other kids are alright and some are completely indifferent to
                        reading.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: I would put myself in the middle category. I didn't spend a lot of time
                    reading for pleasure because as I got older the studies were so demanding. When
                    I was younger, I read a lot of biographies and mystery stories. I always thought
                    that rendezvous was “ren dez-vous.” I didn't really have a model for that. I was
                    more into after school activities and then coming home and doing my homework and
                    going to bed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about sports? Was this something into which you put a
                        lot of time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: Oh, yes. I did a lot of sports. One of the things I remember about sixth
                    grade was that at lunchtime one friend and I would be the first ones out on the
                    playing fields and we called the shots as to what kind of game was going to be
                    played and who was going to play. We played kickball. But in high school, I
                    played all the sports. In the fall I played hockey. In the winter there was
                    basketball, swimming, volleyball and baseball. In fact, I got an award at the
                    end of high school for being the best athlete and academic together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're now in the era where women's sports activities are
                        emphasized, but in the period that we're talking about, you really had to
                        work at it to get into these things, didn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: We mostly did it at our own high school. What came later was a lot more
                    intramural activities. In fact, when my mother was the supervisor of physical
                    education for the Cincinnati schools, that was what consumed most of her time,
                    the intramural activities. But we didn't really have much of that when I was
                    growing up. It was mostly within our own school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you got to high school in the late '50s, were
                        there any particular subjects that you liked?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>LEADER: I liked English a lot. I liked writing. I liked history it wasn't much
                    fun the way we were being taught. We had to keep memorizing all these dates and
                    things. They didn't make it live for us, which is I guess why I didn't go in
                    that direction. I do find it fascinating. I worked on the school newspaper which
                    is where I got interested in journalism. I carried that on into university. I
                    liked the idea of other languages but I didn't think I was very good at them. I
                    did study Latin and French but I didn't get very far with either. You don't
                    speak Latin and I didn't study French long enough to speak it. I certainly never
                    got to dream in French at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in dramatics or music?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: I was in the choir. I have, as you can hear, a rather deep voice and so
                    as a young entrant into high school, I was recruited into the choir to be a
                    tenor because the boys' voices hadn't changed yet and I had a deeper voice than
                    most of the boys. I enjoyed very much the choir and the concerts that we did. I
                    was also in some plays, not the starring roles, not the big roles, but because I
                    had this strong voice that carried well, they liked to cast me with
                    something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about church? Did you get involved in church
                        activities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: I went to church when I was growing up. But I didn't go to Sunday school
                    because I was very much put off by the prejudices of the people that were in the
                    group. I was very unwilling to stay in a group that was so opposed to people who
                    were different.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this anti-Semitism, anti-black, or anti-Italian,
                        anti-immigrant?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: It was anti-Semitic and anti-black and I remember once case where it was
                    anti-Indian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What denomination was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: I'd rather not go into all that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Things have changed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: These were children that were behaving like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm just trying to capture the time because things have
                        changed so much for everyone. I'm 75 years old and I recall all these
                        prejudices. They were quite acceptable then. You could have these things and
                        nobody would call you on it. We've come a long way, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: After grade school, I went to a high school that drew students from all
                    over the city. It was an academic high school. Now they call them “magnet
                    schools” and things like that. And so we had a much greater mix of people than
                    in the neighborhood schools. We had a lot of blacks and a lot of Jewish people.
                    I was already interested in people who were different. I was thrilled to be
                    invited to some of the Jewish homes for some of their ceremonies. It was painful
                    to have some children speak so badly of others who were different from them.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were reflecting their parents. A certain generation
                        which I think eventually helped bring about a change was sensitive to the
                        fact that there were a lot of people with these prejudices and they tried to
                        pass them down. The passing down didn't take with a lot of us, thank
                        God.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>While you were in high school, were you looking towards what you were going to do
                    with yourself?</p>
                <p>LEADER: I think of course in our generation, we were expected to go to college
                    and then get married right after. If we were going to have some profession or
                    skill, it should be something that would be portable and be compatible with
                    whatever career your spouse was pursing. So, I wasn't really giving a lot of
                    thought to a career, although I was pretty sure that I didn't want to be a
                    teacher. I wasn't opposed to teachinmy mother was a teacher and I was very fond
                    of many of my teachers, but I thought that world a little confining. Maybe this
                    is a prejudice of mine, but I thought that many teachers didn't have the view
                    outside the school walls and I wanted to go beyond those walls. So teaching I
                    was pretty sure wasn't going to be the direction that I would go.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Cincinnati. How do you get away from all
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>LEADER: I didn't really break out much for college. I only went as far as a
                    little beyond Columbus, Ohio, to Dennison University, which was a very good
                    academic school. It was challenging. But in many ways, I probably should have
                    chosen a little bit differently for my own interests. I declared English as my
                    major and then went overseas after my junior year. I went with the Experiment in
                    International Living to Denmark. This was a wonderful experience but
                    fortunately, it wasn't as challenging as it might have been. It was challenging
                    enough for a kid from Cincinnati. We flew over from Connecticut, a 17-hour
                    propeller flight with all these kids who were going to all these different
                    places. We landed in Paris. Then I guess we took a train up to Denmark. One of
                    my memorable first experiences in Paris was going through a cafeteria line and
                    pointing to what I wanted, having no idea what it wait turned out to be tripe! I
                    was just appalled when I found out what it was. But we had a great time in
                    Denmark. Most of the other kids lived with families, but I lived with a young
                    woman who was a journalist. She wasn't much older than I was at the time,
                    probably five or six years. We had a great time chasing fires. She was the local
                    reporter for a big town newspaper that was some miles away. We chased fires and
                    did these kinds of things. We had a great time. I traveled around the country
                    and she had her newspaper do a story on me. I told them that the first thing I
                    did in each town where I went was to go to the bakery, so they had a big picture
                    of me eating my favorite Danish pastry. My mother always says her biggest
                    mistake in raising me was, giving me the opportunity to travel. I took the
                    opportunity and stayed overseas. I did not go back to college that year. I
                    joined one of the gals from the program I was on and then we met a friend of
                    hers. We hitchhiked up to Sweden and Norway in 1962. Then we came down and met a
                    friend of hers in Amsterdam and went over to England and hitchhiked all around
                    England and came back. Then we went divergent ways and I was on my own. I had a
                    Eurail pass. I stayed in Europe until Christmastime. I happened to be in Berlin
                    at the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis. I had this naive idea that if anything
                    happened I would definitely be rescued by my embassy. Of course, I hadn't
                    registered with the embassy, so there was absolutely no way embassy personnel
                    would have known that there a U.S. student in the German student underground. I
                    stayed in youth hostels. “Europe on Five Dollars a Day” was our Bible. We had
                    lots of adventures.</p>
                <p>Then we came back. I changed my major from English to government. The only thing
                    I wanted to do was to get out of the university and get on with life, knowing by
                    then that there was a big world out there.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk a little about when you arrived at Dennison in 1960.
                        What was it like? What were the interests of the student body?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: Dennison was a school that had a very strong Greek influence. There were
                    lots of sororities and fraternities. The men lived in their fraternity houses.
                    The women did not live in their sorority houses. Those were strong groups. The
                    people weren't very interested in things beyond the university and beyond their
                    activities for Friday night and the weekends. I wasn't very compatible with that
                    way of looking at the world.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came back from this experience abroad, did you
                        find yourself more restive than you had been before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: Initially, I went through phases of wanting to transfer universities. I
                    felt I had to go somewhere else. But when I came back, I only had a year and a
                    half left to go and I decided that the only thing I wanted to do was finish and
                    get out. I just had to stick with it. I made the investment there, so I didn't
                    worry about transferring anywhere. I just stuck it out. That was when I started
                    working with the foreign students. We had a few foreign students on campus. I
                    tried to help with their orientation and assisted them in forming a kind of a
                    group. Some of them didn't want to be grouped, didn't want that kind of
                    connection, but some of them were happy to be pushed into some sort of a support
                    network.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Kennedy phenomenon? Many students were
                        attracted to the idea of government service. In his inaugural address, he
                        said, “Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for
                        your country.” Was that a spirit among the group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: I would say probably not, not at that university. Kennedy's death was
                    very moving. The assassination took place at the beginning of our senior year.
                    That was something that moved a lot of us in a very emotional way. I would say
                    that probably the greater phenomenon was the Beatles, who made their first trip
                    to the United States around the same time. But there were efforts to invigorate
                    the campus a little bit. I remember the current representative, John Lewis, came
                    to campus. It was the civil rights movement era. He came to our campus and said,
                    “If you sit on the sidelines, you're part of the problem and not part of the
                    solution.” He was trying to encourage people to go South, which was of course
                    something that my family would never have allowed me to do. The March on
                    Washington was the summer of 1963. All of these things were very formative in my
                    thinking, in my development. I did have an opportunity to perhaps have an impact
                    on the thinking. I was editor of the newspaper. But I never wrote an editorial.
                    In fact, they chastised me for that. The faculty advisor for the paper chastised
                    me. The only time I ever wrote an editorial was after the Kennedy assassination.
                    But I guess I felt so out of step with everybody there that whatever I wrote
                    would probably have been very different from the general culture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the faculty have much of a political or social
                        influence? Were they trying to open your eyes to the outside world,
                        particularly the world beyond the U.S.?</hi>

                <p>LEADER: Certainly in some of the courses that I took in the government
                    department, we were looking at what was going on in the world. I recall that we
                    had a class in developing societies. The teacher really didn't know much about
                    it at all. He was learning with us. We were talking about Southern Rhodesia and
                    Northern Rhodesia and he wasn't quite sure what was going on there, but he knew
                    something was going on and so we were all made aware of the fact that something
                    was going on. Of course, we didn't have the Internet to go to and find out like
                    we do now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you pointed towards? Did you have any particular
                        goal in mind? Did you know anything about the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: I took the Foreign Service exam before I graduated. I didn't pass it that
                    time. Then a year later, I took it again and passed but I never finished the
                    oral part of the exam before I went overseas as a volunteer teacher. So that got
                    put on the shelf.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did anyone direct you towards the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: I don't even know how I found out about it. I sure didn't know much about
                    it. I know I was motivated to go in that direction. But there weren't as many
                    opportunities for overseas work then as there are now. Today any field that
                    anybody wants to go into can be turned into an international experience. But
                    then, it was through the United States Agency for International Development
                    (USAID) or the Foreign Service that you could get into international work. And I
                    was definitely oriented toward doing something in the international arena.</p>

                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>LEADER: In 1964. At the end of my senior year my mother remarried. I didn't want
                    to go overseas directly. I applied for and was accepted into the Peace Corps. I
                    would have been in one of the first groups to go to Africa and one of the first
                    groups to go to Niger. Ironically, one of my good friends today was in that
                    group but I didn't know her then. I met her much later. I applied to the Peace
                    Corps and was hemming and hawing about actually joining up since, my mother was
                    getting married. I thought maybe I should stick around for a while and get to
                    know my new family. I had a stepbrother and a stepsister. I went to New York at
                    spring break for a little conference that I recall was run by the Collegiate
                    Council for the United Nations. Or maybe they were just participating in the
                    conference. But it was the student group of the United Nations Association of
                    the United States of America. I met the person who was the executive director
                    and he offered me a job in New York working for this organization. I accepted
                    and was headed for New York. At the same time my senior advisor at Dennison was
                    running a program in Washington, DC that was under the auspices of the Friends
                    Committee for National Legislation. It was called the Congress of American
                    Foreign Policy. So I managed to go to New York and start with the Collegiate
                    Council and then go to Washington for the summer and then go back to New York in
                    the fall. So, I was doing Congress on American Foreign Policy here in
                    Washington. It was my first time inside the State Department. I felt it very
                    Kafkaesque with all these places where there were wires for telephones but no
                    telephones. I recall we were interviewing people and we needed to take some
                    notes and I found a place to sit right outside the Secretary of State's office,
                    which of course you can't get into now unless you've got all kinds of badges and
                    so forth. So, that was my real introduction to Washington. Then I went up to New
                    York and pretty much had the run of the UN.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LEADER: That particular seminar was looking at the issue of where is the origin,
                    the formulation, of foreign policy? Is it in the State Department, in Congress,
                    in the National Security Council? We were looking at all of these entities and
                    trying to see who really had the upper hand in creating foreign policy.</p>

                <p>LEADER: My job at this Collegiate Council for the United Nations was to provide
                    support to affiliated groups at universities across the country. One of the
                    things that these groups did was Model United Nations programs. So, my job was
                    to collect information on various UN issues that might be discussed at these
                    Model UN sessions, including both specific issues or specific country
                    perspectives. So, I was in touch with the people at the United Nations in the
                    Secretariat and I was in touch with missions of various countries around town to
                    get packets of information about their policies and their points of view on the
                    various issues. One of my constant contacts was at the Russian embassy and his
                    name was Mr. Petre Pavlovksi. He would always say, “Hello, this is Mr. Peter and
                    Paul.” I also did a lot by telephone. I didn't necessarily go to meet the
                    people.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This gave you a pretty solid world view, didn't it, both
                        the foreign policy conference and then the UN?</hi>

                </p>
                <p>LEADER: I had actually passed it. But when I was working in New York, a lot of
                    things crossed my desk. One was a brochure about being a volunteer for the
                    Unitarian Universalist Service Committee. At the time I was going to Boston for
                    a conference and so I went and talked with them about going on one of their
                    programs. This was in contrast to the Peace Corps. At that time, in one's young
                    life, a two-year commitment to the Peace Corps seemed very considerable. This
                    other organization was only asking for a one year commitment. I said, “I'd like
                    to go to India or Uganda.” I think they may have had programs in both those
                    countries. They said, “We want to send you to Bechuanaland.” I said, “Where is
                    that?” They showed me a map. There in the middle of southern Africa was this
                    empty space with the name “Bechuanaland” across it. All the roads stopped at the
                    border. There was a railroad that went across it from Southern Rhodesia to South
                    Africa, but that was all there was. I said, “Let me think about this.” I went
                    back to New York and searched reference materials in universities, and there was
                    nothing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You'd have to get something on hunting or something like
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: What there was was information about the lead chieftain of Bechuanaland,
                    who was Sir Seretse Khama. He had defied his tribal elders by marrying an
                    Englishwoman. That was all the information I had. I said, “This sounds kind of
                    interesting” and so I went.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LEADER: I was there from August 1965 until August 1967. Of course, I extended for
                    a second year. By the time I left, it was Botswana because it had become
                    independent in 1966. I was there one year before independence and one year
                    after. Of course, at that time there was no U.S. representation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was it like there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: It was very exciting to be in this country at that time. I was working on
                    a project that was kind of revolutionary. It was a secondary school started by a
                    South African exile. I was going to say “refugee” and in fact he was a refugee
                    from South Africa. He had been in the South African diplomatic service and had
                    been posted in Congo Brazzaville and so was getting a lot of contact with
                    officials and others there. He learned from them about his own society and
                    apartheid and went back to South Africa with a different perspective. He left
                    the diplomatic service and fled the country. I have forgotten exactly why he had
                    to flee the country. Anyway, he started this school with the philosophy that the
                    school could be the focal point of development in a community. He started the
                    idea of brigades where people would come together for training such as for
                    construction or agriculturbut in the case of these men and women, it was
                    weaving. So he made these groups. After they got their training, they would
                    continue as cooperatives. He was very much promoting a cooperative movement and
                    was trying to have an impact on the community of Serowe, the largest town in
                    Botswana at the time and also the seat of the largest tribe that Sir Seretse
                    Khama headed. So, we were part of a very exciting project. My role was to teach
                    English to the students, which I just adored doing. They were wonderful. They
                    taught me to love Shakespeare. They loved it so much that you just had to enjoy
                    it. So, we had a great time with the students. Back then in Southern Africa, the
                    school year was divided into three 10-week segments with a month break in
                    between. On all those breaks, I would travel around in Southern Africa, mostly
                    by hitchhiking. So, I had a lot of experience and exposure to Southern
                    Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find it at that time? This was at the height
                        of apartheid. How did you deal with it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: With difficulty. As a matter of fact, my roommate was a woman from South
                    Africa.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>So one of the destinations on one of the Christmases was to South Africa. I
                    didn't even realize I needed a visa, so I had to send my passport down to get
                    the visa because there was no embassy. I told them that I was anxious to come
                    and visit their beautiful country and I wanted to see all of the game parks and
                    other attractions. I got my visa with no problem and went down to Johannesburg
                    and Durban and Swaziland the first time. I recall huddling over what we called a
                    Victrola. We were listening to a record that was banned in South Africa. I was
                    with people who were a little bit skeptical themselves about their setup and
                    their situation. When you would meet South Africans, they were exactly like
                    everybody later said they were, which if they were white South Africans is very
                    defensive about their setup. If you even asked them any questions, they would
                    tell yothese were people that we were hitchhiking witimmediately that they don't
                    hate their Africans, they do everything for them. It was an eye opener. Coming
                    back from Swaziland into South Africa, we were picked up by an Indian couple.
                    When we stopped to get something to eat, we had to go to one place and they had
                    to go to another place in this little restaurant. When we all finished, we came
                    back together and got in the same car and went on. We had some of these bizarre
                    experiences.</p>
                <p>Another vacation, I hitchhiked across the Kalahari Desert to what was then
                    Southwest Africa, now Namibia. I went to a ceremony celebrating five years of
                    South Africa being the Republic of South Africa starting in 1960. This was now
                    1965. I felt very uncomfortable. First of all, it was being held in Windhoek and
                    South Africa was supposed to be in charge but they weren't supposed to be
                    imposing their government on Southwest Africa, but of course it was like it was
                    all integrated. When we went down to Capetown there was no border control at all
                    between Namibia and South Africa. So, the whole thing was very unsettling. But
                    it was interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any problem hitchhiking both with apartheid and
                        being a woman?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: I was hitchhiking with a male teacher from my school. But we didn't
                    encounter any problems. Sometimes even blacks would pick us up and put us in the
                    back of their trucks in Windhoek. So I did have many experiences in South
                    Africa. Then I went to Zambia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That had been Northern Rhodesia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: Right, but it was now independent, so it was now Zambia. It was coming
                    back from Zambia that I somehow ran afoul of South African law or I offended the
                    South Africans in some way. At the border between Zambia and Southern Rhodesia,
                    some people who were clearly South African intelligence agents searched my
                    baggage. My baggage was a very small rucksack and they couldn't believe that's
                    all I had for six weeks, but it was. They found a book that was by a South
                    African, a book that was banned in South Africa. They took that away from me.
                    They said it was banned in Rhodesia and they had to send it to Salisbury to see
                    whether I could keep it. I never got it back.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the time of the UDI, Unilateral Declaration of
                        Independence, of Ian Smith?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: I think it was UDI. So, these people took away a book of mine. They also
                    saw some newspaper clippings I had. They were from SWANU (South West Africa
                    National Union) and SWAPO (South West Africa People's Organization) people that
                    I had met in Zambia. These were anti-apartheid organizations for Southwest
                    Africa, now Namibia. So they didn't like that. When we traveled in Southern
                    Africa, we never gave the name of our school director because he was a refugee,
                    a rebel, a well known troublemaker from the South Africans' point of view. We
                    just put our box number down. They looked at my paper and said, “P.O. Box 101.
                    That's Swaneng Hill School. How's my friend Patrick.” I knew I was in trouble.
                    They asked me lots of questions about what I had been doing in Zambia and so
                    forth. As a result, I never got a visa for South Africa again. I did try again
                    to go to South Africa, but I was not allowed. In fact, I've never been to South
                    Africa since it's been free. Even later when I had a job with the Peace Corps, I
                    didn't even try to get a visa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were doing these trips, did you ever run across
                        the U.S. embassy in Pretoria or Capetown?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: I ran across the U.S. embassies in Zambia and in Lusaka. When I told some
                    officials there that I had passed the Foreign Service exam but not done the oral
                    and I had come out to Africa, they said, “But you should have gone ahead and
                    done the oral because you could have done it here in Lusaka and we would have
                    passed you for sure.” So, there I was, afraid of the oral which I never wanted
                    to do. I passed up a chance to get into the Foreign Service early on because I
                    didn't know about negotiating to postpone it while I was being a volunteer and
                    the whole thing just sort of lapsed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Botswana from '65 to '67. What happened in
                        '67?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: I applied to graduate schools and selected Chicagwrong agaiover Tufts and
                    over Columbia. So I went out to Chicago and did a year there. I had a wonderful
                    friend who was willing to listen to all of my stories of Africa, so that was
                    good therapy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the '60s, Africa was very high on the list for
                        young people. Countries were becoming independent and it was quite exciting.
                        This was the new world and the winds of change were blowing. Had you caught
                        this African fever?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>LEADER: I did indeed. Having spent two years there, I was very much involved with
                    Africa and the change that was going on. My area of emphasis in my international
                    relations degree that I did in Chicago was Africa. But I was again very
                    impatient to get on with life and not stay in the academic arena. I recall
                    vividly talking to my colleagues. I was in a special interdisciplinary
                    international relations program. I said, “What are you going to do next year?” A
                    number of them were applying for scholarships for the second year. I said, “Why
                    are you going to stay a second year?” We only had nine hours of classwork and a
                    couple of things. They said they were going to stay and do that. I remember
                    asking people whom I met at the University of Chicago, “How long have you been
                    here” and they would say, “I've only been here six years.” Somebody else would
                    say, “I've only been here four years” and this got me really nervous because I
                    didn't want to hang around for any eight years.</p>
                <p>Again, just a fortuitous incident: I came to Washington during the spring break
                    to visit a friend. While I was here, I walked into Africa Report magazine. I
                    guess I knew the magazine from my studies and I knew that they had their office
                    in Dupont Circle. So I walked in and asked, “Do you have any jobs?” They said,
                    “Well, fill out this form.” It turned out that the person who was at that time
                    maybe the deputy assistant editoHelen Kitchen was the editohad got his
                    international relations degree from the University of Chicago. He hired me. So I
                    left Chicago before I had even finished with my degree because I had this job
                    offer with Africa Report magazine. What could be more fun? I was doing what they
                    called the “chronologies.” These were little paragraphs in the magazine giving
                    political, economic, and social information about various countries. My focus
                    was the Anglophone countries of Africa. My immediate supervisor who did the
                    Francophone countries was Chet Crocker. So, we worked with our desks close
                    together for about a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the bloom still on the rose as far as Africa was
                        concerned? Later, things got?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: At the end of the year with this magazine, its parent, the
                    African-American Institute, had financial difficulties and so they had to
                    eliminate our portion of the magazine and they moved the whole magazine up to
                    New York. So we were out of a job. The people were very kind to us. They gave us
                    enough time to unwind and look for other things. I took the time that they gave
                    us to finish my masters degree from Chicago. I did my thesis at that time using
                    the resources in Washington. I had wanted to do it on Botswana, but they
                    wouldn't let me because there was nothing written on Botswana. I later found out
                    that somebody I met made his name on doing a thesis on the brigades at our
                    school. But they wouldn't let me do anything on education in Botswana, so I did
                    something on education in Tanzania, which was much more in vogue at the time
                    with Nyerere and so forth.</p>
                <p>While I was out of a job and unemployed there was also a lot of momentum to do
                    something in the United States, and not to go overseas.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about 1968?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: Yes. The day I left Chicago was the day of the Chicago riots. We had
                    already seen what could happen because Martin Luther King had been killed. We
                    had had some marches there. I had been in a march where we got tear-gassed
                    because we were protesting police brutality.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you in the political spectrum?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: In Chicago, one of my roommates was with the Students for Democratic
                    Society, the SDS. I was not there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the radical student group.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: It was the radical spectrum at the time. The Weathermen had not yet been
                    formed. So, the SDS was really on the radical end of the spectrum. After we had
                    this march where we were tear-gassed and the people who were leading it were all
                    these SDSers, I said, “No, I don't think they're people I want to follow.” But I
                    was still very much on the critical side of the spectrum.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved in Vietnam protests?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: Yes, I was. Some people now may wonder? I decided at that time that I
                    didn't want to go into the Foreign Service because of Vietnam, so I turned my
                    sights elsewhere, partly because of Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: I went into education.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which you said you didn't want to get into.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>LEADER: Right. Which I had said earlier that I didn't want to get into. I went
                    into the DC public schools in the Office of Planning, Research, and Evaluation.
                    I started part-time with them and they asked me three times to work full-time
                    and finally the third time, I said, “I'd better do this because I don't have
                    anything else working. I'd better get this job under my belt.” So, I did go
                    there and work there and spent a total of five years at two different stretches
                    working in the DC public school system.</p>
                <p>But before I actually went into that part of the school system, I started doing
                    substitute teaching and taking some courses in teaching around here. There was a
                    bit of a tragedy. A girl who was in my class with whom I was doing a lot of
                    studying, was accidentally shot by her father, a retired policeman. So that
                    really had a big impact on my wanting to move forward with these courses. My
                    substitute teaching career was rather short-lived because I wasn't very good at
                    keeping discipline in the classroom. I had a classroom with two doors, which now
                    would never happen. One of them would be locked. But there were two doors.
                    People could slip into your classroom and you wouldn't even know it. It was not
                    a pretty scene. I remember to this day, one of the children said, “Miss Leader,
                    the reason that the children don't behave for you is because you don't beat
                    them.” I said, “If I've got to beat the kids to get them to behave, I'm in the
                    wrong place.” So, that was rather short-lived. But I went to the public school
                    headquarters and was rather intrigued by the whole business of evaluation. We
                    evaluated a number of different projects that were in the school system from
                    drug programs to environmental education.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk about the school system at that time. This would have
                        been about when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: I started there in 1970. I worked for three and a half years and then I
                    said, “This is a dead end job. I'm white in a black school system.” I had
                    wonderful colleagues. I had no problem with that. But I just didn't see myself
                    going anywhere. So, I applied to law schools and to journalism schools and I got
                    into Columbia University School of Journalism, to which I went. Very
                    challenging.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go to the school system first. The Washington DC
                        school system at one time was considered quite good. This was unfortunately
                        when it was essentially a white school system. You're now dealing with a
                        transition. It was becoming more and more black.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: It was 90% black already.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've talked to people who have served there and from what
                        you read in the paper, it seems to be a system that got a lot of money and
                        didn't deliver.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>LEADER: I think there were a lot of problems of leadership. This was one of the
                    things that I noticed. They were always looking everywhere outside of Washington
                    to bring in educators to be the superintendent, to be the head of the school
                    system. Washington, especially the black part of Washington, which so many
                    people in the white part of Washington really don't know since they don't have
                    that much contact with the black part of the system, it was a very tight-knit
                    community. It had its mores and its leaders and everything and here they were
                    continually bringing people in from the outside and they didn't last a bit. They
                    didn't get respect. They just never got accepted. I think this continual
                    turnover in superintendents had a very detrimental effect. I was in a lot of
                    classrooms and I saw a lot of people who were very dedicated and working very
                    hard but their own education hadn't been the greatest. There wasn't that much
                    teacher training going on. The leadership at the individual schools wasn't as
                    good as it should have been. So, there were a lot of problems with the school
                    system even at that time. And it was huge at that time. If I recall correctly,
                    there were 140,000 kids in the school system. Now it's way down to about half
                    that. But we felt like we were doing something. Back to my Botswana roots,
                    education is the foundation for people to make a difference. We felt like we
                    were having a bit of a role in this kind of a system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My wife was taking teachers training, getting an education
                        degree, at the University of Maryland and did her practice teaching at Shah
                        Junior High. She was very impressed by the teacher she worked with, a black
                        woman who had a degree from Harvard.</hi>

                        This seems to be one of the causes of the disintegration of the family

                </p>
                <p>LEADER: I can't place in my mind the extent of the drug problem by that time, but
                    I know that one of the programs that we evaluated was a pilot project to
                    introduce drug education into the school system. It was a program to try to
                    familiarize people with the problem and to encourage young people to just stay
                    away from drugs. It was already a problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, the real problem was the families. The fathers
                        weren't there and the mothers? There was a lot of addiction at the adult

                </p>
                <p>LEADER: I kept flitting. This time, I had an image of being the foreign
                    correspondent. I had no idea that to be a foreign correspondent you had to cover
                    war. It was only later that I grasped that most of them sat in hotels in
                    deepest, darkest Africa and did their reporting from there. But I had this idea
                    that I wanted to be a foreign correspondent. When I graduated, you have to pay
                    your dues by taking the city beat and the police beat and all these things and I
                    just wasn't quite ready for that. I guess I just wasn't quite ready to pay my
                    dues the way I should have to that profession.</p>

                <p>LEADER: I was unemployed again, the second time I collected unemployment
                    compensation. But I was also involved with the African-American Institute in New
                    York and was helping with a program involving African students who had been
                    brought to this country to study. I was trying to identify jobs that would take
                    them back to their own countries to use their skills.</p>
                <p>Then my old boss at the DC public school system called and said, “I need you to
                    come back.” So, again, not having much else on my plate, I did. I accepted her
                    offer to come back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about this idea of getting African students in the

                <p>LEADER: I was involved with the Southern Africa Student Program, which was trying
                    to get people to go back to Zimbabwe, South Africa, still Southern Rhodesia,
                    Zambia, and we weren't having a great deal of success. People who came from
                    Botswana always went back. But the other countries not so much.</p>

                <p>LEADER: Right. And Nigerians were staying as well. A lot of African students were

                <p>LEADER: This time, I was mostly on the planning side of things. But I wasn't
                    doing a lot. I finally decided that I had to get very serious about getting out.
                    I had applied previously for a job with the McGraw Hill newsletters. I had a
                    friend working there and she told me there was another opening and I should come
                    and look into it, which I did. I got the job. So, I left the DC Public Schools
                    to work on a newsletter having to do with chemical pollution in the workplace.
                    It was a newsletter in search of a subject and eventually evolved into a
                    newsletter on fertilizers, but I left by that time. I also interviewed with the
                    Peace Corps at that time and I was offered a job as the associate Peace Corps
                    director for education in Zaire. So, in late 1976, I left for Zaire.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: I was there for all of 1977, 1978, and almost to the end of 1979.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is November 3, 2003. What was Zaire like in
                        '76?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: Zaire was under Mobutu Sese Sekou. It had been several years in decline
                    and people were getting to the point where they thought that it couldn't go any
                    lower but during the time I was there it just kept lower and lower and lower.
                    People didn't have jobs. If they did have jobs, they had to work two jobs.
                    Oftentimes, some member of the family had some sort of business selling
                    something on the road that would make them some money. It was very difficult for
                    people to make ends meet. Because of this, it spawned a lot of corruption.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>I was working with the education volunteers. In the schools, there was a lot of
                    deception and a lot of people used their positions as teachers or head of the
                    food program at the school to enrich themselves. For example, the teacher in
                    charge of food would get a certain amount of money from the students and then he
                    or she was responsible for buying the food for that term for two or three
                    months. What was happening was that the food would run out about a month before
                    the end of the term, so they had to close school early and the students had to
                    all go home. The evidence indicated the teacher had just taken the money and was
                    using it for his own purposes. The same was going on in the examinations.
                    Students would buy answers from the teachers so that they would be able to move
                    on to the next level. The volunteers were seeing this and were very upset by it.
                    It made a lot of them feel that we should not be there at all. My argument was,
                    if they weren't there, who was going to provide any model at all of some sort of
                    integrity for the students? They just weren't seeing it in quite a number of the
                    teachers. This was even in cases where the schools were very closely affiliated
                    with the churches. The school system was very run down and wasn't able to manage
                    very well. It was a very big country, so they really depended a lot on the
                    schools that were run by the various missionary groups, some of which still had
                    their missionaries in the schools. Some were becoming more and more aligned with
                    the government. They were also still very important in education and healthcare.
                    So, it was just a very difficult place for people to survive. Inflation was
                    incredible at that time and was quite out of control. As U.S. government
                    officials we were not allowed to deal on the black market, so all of our money
                    was exchanged at the official rate. I would sometimes pay $70 for a lunch if I
                    went out to a restaurant, which would probably cost about $10 if I could use
                    black market money. It was rampant. I do recall sometimes when we had to pay
                    vendors of some sort, we had to take suitcases of money. They didn't have large
                    denomination bills. So it was not unusual at all to see people carrying around
                    briefcases full of cash. The banking system wasn't working very well and you
                    couldn't bank like we do here. You couldn't go into a bank and write a check.
                    Most of the transactions were done by cash. So, it was a tough life for a lot of
                    people and for the volunteers. People had so little money that they were rarely
                    eating meat. Volunteers would report to me that they felt embarrassed if they
                    cooked meat because their counterparts were unable to do so. Volunteers are
                    expected to live at the same level of the people that they're working among, so
                    a lot of them were going without just because their counterparts were unable to
                    afford it. People just weren't getting paid. If they were government workers,
                    they were not getting paid regularly. Teachers were also suffering from this
                    situation. They never knew when they would get a paycheck. I remember seeing one
                    paycheck. It was duly made out to the teacher's name and then where you're
                    supposed to write the amount, it said, “000000.” It was a check for nothing. It
                    was a very hard life and people didn't really think that it could go much lower,
                    but it did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure you were getting reports from our volunteers who
                        were out there trying to teach. Were they feeling they were making a

                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>LEADER: They were teaching and they were usually very popular teachers. They
                    oftentimes had activities in addition to their teaching to make a difference in
                    the community like raising rabbits that would be a source of meat for the
                    village. There were volunteers, not under my jurisdiction, who were doing fish
                    farming and they were introducing a source of protein into the diets, which were
                    very heavily dependent on manioc, which is cassava. I have always retained one
                    little fact in my head about it which is that it takes seven pounds of it to
                    make the amount of protein that you need in a meal. Your stomach would burst.
                    It's pretty tasteless stuff. But some of the teachers got very depressed because
                    they didn't feel like they could make a difference, that they were just swimming
                    against the tide and the tide was so overwhelming that they couldn't make a
                    difference. But others felt that they had something to contribute and that they
                    could plug along and try to contribute to the kids and their communities.</p>

                    just terminate. Not many did. If they were having some serious problems at their
                    school, there was a possibility of my moving them to another school in Zaire,

                        to cities? Or were they out practically up against the easternmost
                        borders?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: The volunteers in Zaire were spread fairly evenly throughout the country.
                    Zaire is made up of regions and each of the regions had a capital and in each of
                    the capitals we had a Peace Corps volunteer who was the regional representative.
                    That person had a house and a radio and a vehicle in the capital city and we did
                    radio checks daily from Kinshasa with those people. So they were the first line
                    of recourse for the volunteers in that region. Some of the volunteers were quite
                    some distance from those regional capitals. My job entailed visiting the
                    volunteers at their sites and so for every maybe three weeks out of every five
                    or six, I was on the road. That entailed flying with a local airline to a
                    regional capital and then going with the regional representative in a Land Rover
                    to visit the various volunteers. We would usually try to visit all of them in a
                    given region, spend the night with them, meet the people who were in charge of
                    the school, meet the other teachers, observe them in their classrooms, and
                    things like this. It was a fairly strenuous job.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>We were able to provide the volunteers with some support so they felt the capital
                    was involved and that the Peace Corps staff was involved and concerned about
                    them. I think that one of my biggest critics was one gal who felt that we
                    weren't doing enough for her. Frankly, I think she was mistaken. She was getting
                    a lot of support from the teachers and the leadership of the school where she
                    was, which was a religious school. The volunteers would get their support from
                    their environment and most of them were doing pretty well. They had learned
                    French to start off with and then they'd get into their areas and find out
                    they'd have to speak some local language like Swahili or Lingala or some of the
                    other languages. So I organized a language training program for the summer
                    between their first and second year. I did this in four different regions for
                    four different local languages. It worked out great. We got some of the Zairians
                    who were language trainers in the summer programs to help out. We had people
                    from a university. We identified the language speakers. The kids really liked
                    that. They felt in the second year they were much better equipped to speak the
                    local language and to communicate with those who couldn't speak French. So that
                    worked really well.</p>
                <p>It was an interesting time in Zaire because it was during Shaba I and Shaba II.
                    Twice while I was there, Shaba was invaded by people coming from Angola. They
                    were generally people who had fled when Mobutu had taken over, somehow felt that
                    they had to flee for their lives. They reconstituted themselves as rebel groups
                    and had recourse to arms and came into Zaire. The first year, it affected my
                    volunteers in Kamina. Kamina was an important location because there was a big
                    airport there and the Americans, probably prompted by Shaba I, turned that into
                    a very big base in Central Africa. I had been there just before the war started
                    and then I went down to Lubumbashi and we called our volunteers into Lubumbashi.
                    I went down there and talked with all of them. They felt that they wanted to
                    stay in Zaire but they wanted to go to a different place. I reassigned most of
                    them. One of them is in the State Department right now doing quite well. The
                    Zairian husband of another one is also doing quite well in the State Department.
                    He has become an American citizen. The turmoil didn't necessarily deter these
                    people from further service overseas.</p>
                <p>The second Shaba was the one that Americans are probably more familiar with
                    because it was an invasion that reached Kolwezi, the area where the G�camines
                    has its copper mines. There were a lot of foreign people working there, mostly
                    Belgians, some French. That was about an hour to two hours north of Lubumbashi.
                    We had no volunteers in Kolwezi, so we were pretty fortunate. The people there
                    were held hostage for some time and many of them were killed and it was a very
                    ugly affair. I found out later that the only reason why there were no volunteers
                    in Kolwezi when the invasion began was because they had all been invited to a
                    big party there but they had no way to get there because the regional
                    representative had gone to the U.S. and had intentionally taken the key to the
                    Land Rover with him so they couldn't use it. Otherwise, I fear we would have had
                    some volunteers who might have been in some real difficult situations. We were
                    fortunate. It worked out. None of the volunteers were in harm's way or at least
                    we got them out of harm's way. We came through it pretty well.</p>

                <p>LEADER: I'm not really able to speak to that because the doctor that we had
                    followed strict rules of confidentiality. Even though I was in charge of 150
                    education volunteers I did not know much about their medical problems. I kept
                    insisting that I should know because they were my volunteers and I should be
                    giving them support, but I did not.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any clashes between Peace Corps volunteers and
                        local officials over the volunteers finding signs of corruption and
                        challenging the people who were siphoning off the money?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: Yes, and this caused a lot of friction sometimes in the schools which led
                    to me having to transfer some volunteers to another location. They weren't
                    dealing with local officials as much as they were with their school officials,
                    at least the ones that I oversaw. But they were very good about trying to work
                    with people and trying to model integrity by their behavior, and I think that it
                    was very important.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much dealing with the Zairian

                </p>
                <p>LEADER: My involvement was really with the education ministry and its officials.
                    Obviously when I went to the various communities, I would sometimes see local
                    officials but not that often. I was mostly dealing with school officials.</p>

                <p>LEADER: Some of them seemed to be very interested in their students and very
                    concerned about education. Others were using their positions in ways that would
                    not be called totally honest. I remember a story that a teacher at a teacher
                    training college in Kinshasa told me. He said that if he were to show up at work
                    one day driving a Mercedes, the students would applaud him rather than ask him
                    where he got the money to buy it. They would applaud him for having the
                    ingenuity to tap those kinds of resources. Everything was turned on its head. It
                    seemed to me that it would be very difficult to get things straightened out
                    again so that people would not feel that they had to milk the system for all
                    they could get because they had no other resources. But I'm afraid that it's
                    probably still happening.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Zaire was well known as being a country where in our

                </p>
                <p>LEADER: The Peace Corps tries to keep its distance from the diplomatic American
                    community. We did that pretty well. Our director would go to staff meetings and
                    report back to us but we were not really privy to what was going on in the
                    embassy. I wasn't aware of the size or the activities of the CIA at all. I was

                    like we did, and the volunteers were not in Kinshasa. There were some in the
                    region called Bandundu which weren't very far from Kinshasa, but I don't think
                    they visited the volunteers very much.</p>

                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>LEADER: While I was there, there was a consulate in Bukavu in the east. They
                    closed the United States information service (USIS) operation in Kano in the
                    north at that time. And there was a very active consulate in Lubumbashi. Parker
                    Borg was the Consul General. So they did have some resources. Parker traveled
                    and was very involved with the volunteers in Lubumbashi. There were volunteers
                    right in Lubumbashi and in some towns not too far from Lubumbashi. During the
                    war, he traveled up to Kamina and was picked up because he didn't have the
                    proper papers. The volunteers had to verify his story, who he was. They laughed
                    about it a lot after. They could have got him in real trouble if they had denied
                    who he was. He moved around a lot. Otherwise, we weren't rigid and rigorous. We
                    didn't have to be because the volunteers didn't have that much access to the
                    embassy nor vice versa. I'm sure that when the director met with people from the
                    embassy he was sharing information as was necessary and appropriate. But there
                    was a line there. When I went down to Lubumbashi to talk with the volunteers, I
                    came back and made my report to my superiors and my other associate Peace Corps
                    directors. Then we, as the staff, made the decision that we would pull the
                    volunteers out of Kamina. So we passed this message on the radio back to them
                    that this decision had been made and we would be working on reassigning them in
                    the country. If there was anybody who felt he or she needed to go home, or if
                    they had only a few months left, then we would go through the termination
                    procedures. Parker Borg happened to be at the volunteers' house when this
                    message was passed. He was very upset by that. So he went back through his
                    channels to the embassy and the next thing I knew, I was summoned to the
                    ambassador's office along with the acting Peace Corps director, our admin
                    officer, and the two of us were sitting there and trying to defend our action.
                    They were saying, “We shouldn't be pulling them out” and we were saying, “We
                    should be pulling them out because they're watching people at checkpoints get
                    forced onto the ground at gunpoint, forced to grovel in mud, and being harassed
                    and so forth.” The volunteers themselves in Kamina had had a group of drunken
                    soldiers come into their house with bayonet sticks on their guns and their house
                    was searched. There were other things like this that had happened that was
                    making it very uncomfortable for them to stay there. The embassy proposed,
                    “Well, what if we talk to the people and we get more protection for the
                    volunteers? What if we can get some kind of promises from the authorities that
                    they will keep things calm?” It just seemed unlikely to me, and I said, “Are you
                    saying that you want to use our volunteers as guinea pigs to calm the situation
                    down in Kamina?” The thoughtful answer was, “Yes.” I said, “No, our volunteers?
                    We have to answer to their parents. We have to answer to Congress. We just can't
                    afford to keep them in a situation that is as volatile as it is. If things calm
                    down, if things get better, then we can put them back. But we can't leave them
                    there when things are as bad as they are.” They accepted it but it was a very
                    difficult encounter on my part with the embassy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Embassies hate to evacuate anybody because it upsets the

                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>LEADER: Well, we hadn't discussed it thoroughly with the embassy first. We felt
                    that it was our decision to make, not theirs, so it hadn't really occurred to us
                    that we needed to vet our decision with the embassy before we announced it. But
                    perhaps in retrospect, that would have been a good idea. But neither the other
                    staff members nor myself were aware of the sensitivities around evacuation. We
                    just knew that we had to do what we had to do to protect them. But the local
                    authority angle is of course a serious one. It's there. One of the schools that
                    we did evacuate people from was in a town closer to Lubumbashi. I thought it was
                    a wonderful little town, Likasi. The principal there said, “We can't count on
                    you if you're going to evacuate people like that, so we don't want any more
                    Peace Corps volunteers.” It was a wonderful little town and a wonderful little
                    school. I had great respect for the school principal. And it was his decision
                    that he couldn't count on the Americans and he wasn't going to have them. I
                    regretted that, but we had done what we had to do.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LEADER: By 1979, I was really burned out. The Peace Corps contract for APCDs
                    (Associate Peace Corps Directors) is usually two and a half years, but they
                    couldn't find anybody to replace me, so I just sort of kept staying and staying
                    and staying. Finally, on my second to last trip, I was going between Kananga and
                    Bujimai and the vehicle we were in lost its steering. We just sort of rolled
                    into the sandbank. Fortunately, we were very close to where we were going to
                    spend the night with the missionaries. They had planes that flew between there
                    and Kananga, so the regional representative went back and got some parts and
                    came back. He himself had to repair the car and we went on. But that was a
                    little bit hairy. On the last trip I took a different car lost its breaks.
                    Fortunately, the driver quickly pulled the emergency break and we didn't have
                    any serious consequences from that one either. But my feeling was that unless we
                    were going to get funding from Washington to repair these cars up to the
                    standard that they needed to be, I wasn't going out anymore. They finally did
                    get somebody to replace me and I left and came back to Peace Corps headquarters,
                    where I spent the next two years as the desk officer for Southern Africa, to
                    1981.</p>

                    traveled in all those places as a volunteer myself, so it was great to get back
                    to that area and become involved with it. We were taking care of things like
                    recruitment, working on budgets and numbers of volunteers and that kind of
                    thing. During this time Zimbabwe became independent. I was asked to do a study
                    to determine whether we should try to start a program there. It was one of the
                    most interesting things I did. I had the opportunity to talk to a lot of people
                    around town who were involved with Zimbabwe, including Johnny Carson, who was at
                    that time on the Hill with the Foreign Relations Committee in the House. So I
                    did a report on that and subsequently did one on Zambia as well. Neither country
                    got volunteers at that time. Zimbabwe has never had volunteers. I think some did
                    go eventually to Zambia. It was at that time that I learned about the whole land
                    problems in Zimbabwe and predicted that there would be problems down the line
                    over land. That was a long time ago. It just took a little time to materialize,
                    but it was clear that that was going to be a problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From the Washington viewpoint, was there a change in the
                        Peace Corps volunteer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: I think that there have been some new directions in volunteer programs,
                    particularly those focused on Eastern Europe, which were involved much more in
                    small business. Even in Africa, there was a lot of emphasis on small business
                    after the Reagan administration came in. But the main program seems not to have
                    really changed. I was looking just the other day at a pie chart which shows that
                    more than half of the volunteers are still involved one way or another in
                    education. There is still English as a second language and teaching math and
                    science. Those have always been the core of the Peace Corps program. It's what
                    the volunteers are most capable of doing because of their backgrounthey are
                    usually university graduates and can be trained to do those things without too
                    much difficulty. They've gone more into teacher training, training teachers for
                    secondary school, training teachers to teach English, training teachers to teach
                    math and science, training teachers to work in elementary schools. There is a
                    lot more focus on teacher training in the education sphere. When I was there, it
                    was when basic human needs was just coming in as the philosophy of aid and this
                    percolated over to Peace Corps. In the aid philosophy, education was not
                    considered a basic human need. There was some pressure within Peace Corps to
                    look at alternatives to teaching in the formal education system. I raised the
                    issue with Peace Corps Washington and said, “If you want us to do something
                    other than formal education, then maybe we need some kind of direction from
                    Washington and maybe a conference would be a good idea to bring all of the
                    education people together and look at this.” They said, “Great idea. You plan
                    it.” So, I did. We had a big conference that year in Nairobi where we looked at
                    alternatives to the regular education. We looked at literacy and literacy
                    training and teacher training and some of these other things. But that
                    initiative didn't really go that far at that time.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>But back to your original question. There was a lot more emphasis on small
                    business, business development. But some of the very basic core activities of
                    Peace Corps haven't really changed, haven't gone away. They've just sort of
                    added new things, branched out into new areas.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LEADER: The Peace Corps has a five year rule. There are exceptions. You can go
                    beyond that now. But at that time it was a five year rule: five years in and
                    then you're out. So, there I was, unemployed again. At that time, however, there
                    was an effort by the State Department to bring in midlevel women and minorities.
                    So, I applied and was accepted and I moved into the State Department about six
                    months after I left the Peace Corps.</p>

                <p>LEADER: The idea was to send people right out into the field, but our training
                    finished in June. I had passed the French language requirement so I didn't need
                    a world language. All the positions had been assigned already, so the other
                    officers were taking their consular courses and doing their GSO (General
                    Services Officer), their admin-type courses, none of which I did at that time. I
                    interviewed with several people around the building and some were very negative
                    about the program and wanted nothing to do with me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The fact that you'd worked in Zaire, this was not an easy
                        place. It's a lot more credit than if you had come out of Topeka or
                        someplace like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: Right. So eventually, I did find a home in AF/W (African Bureau) as the
                    desk officer for the Sahelian countrieUpper Volta, Mali, and Niger. I don't know
                    whether my former officemate, Chet Crocker, who was at this time Assistant
                    Secretary for the Bureau, had anything to do with it or not, but I did go in as
                    a desk officer for the first year. Then I went through the assignment process
                    for the next summer. The EX (Executive Director) of Africa wanted desperately to
                    send me back to Zaire but the ambassador, who already had two midlevel women in
                    his political section, said, “No.” So, I had another option and that was to go
                    to Ouagadougou.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were dealing with West Africa, what was the
                        situation with those countries? Was the desert advancing? Was it drought
                        time there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: Those countries were definitely experiencing drought during that time.
                    The desert was advancing then and has been advancing since. At that time, Mali
                    was still very much in a Soviet orbit. Niger hadn't found any of its mineral
                    wealth. Upper Volta, which became Burkina Faso, was very poor. I remember
                    working on the IMET, the military training program, trying to get that kind of
                    assistance going for them, trying to keep the aid flowing. Basically, aid was
                    the core of our activities with those countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to Ouagadougou, the capital of Upper Volta. You
                        were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: From 1983 to 1985.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Upper Volta like in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>LEADER: The capital, Ouagadougou, was like an overgrown village. It did not have
                    any kind of high buildings or anything. It didn't even have a big marketplace.
                    It just sort of sprawled and it was little communities sort of all tacked
                    together. That was partly a function of the fact that the French had actually
                    had their capital in a town quite a bit to the southwest called Bobo-Dioulasso.
                    That was a proper town in my view, but the capital, Ouagadougou, was very much
                    of an overgrown village. When I visited it 10 years later, there had been some
                    growth and it looked a little bit more like a town by that time. There were some
                    paved roads, but not all that many. They had a nice train that went from
                    Ouagadougou all the way down to Abidjan and Cote d'Ivoire on the coast. The
                    French had done that much. There was another road that went through Togo down to
                    Lome and those were the access points from the coast into Burkina Faso. At that
                    time, the road between Ouagadougou and the capital of neighboring Niger was not
                    paved and it was a good day's drive. I think now it's down to three to four
                    hours between those two capitals. When I was there, it was quite a bit longer
                    than that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: I was political/economic officer. I did some reporting. I called it the
                    “etc. officer.” Pol/econ, etc. I did all of the IMET programs. In that capacity,
                    I was the embassy's link to the defense ministry. The ambassador, Julius Walker,
                    seemed to be quite content to let me maintain the relationship with the defense
                    minister, so I saw him pretty regularly. I maintained this liaison with the
                    military in between visits of the defense attach�, who would come up from time
                    to time from Abidjan and then I'd be his control officer and we'd go around and
                    see all the contacts. Of course, the military was very important. I forgot to
                    say that I got there a few weeks after the coup that brought Thomas San Cara to
                    power. He was a very populist leader who got rid of all the big Mercedes for the
                    government officials and made them drive little black Renault 5s. They set up
                    these Committees for the Defense of the Revolution. The person who was at the
                    head of that was one of my good contacts. I also had to do all the contacts with
                    the foreign ministry and developed very good friends in that area. Burkina Faso
                    rotated onto the UN Security Council while I was there and that was a lot of fun
                    because we worked with them a lot on the issues that were of concern to us at
                    the Security Council.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the role of the French there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: The French were everywhere. They were very involved in Ouagadougou. They
                    had people in the defense ministry. They were advisors to the military. They had
                    a very big role to play.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself often at odds with the French?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>LEADER: Throughout West Africa, particularly at that time, there was a bit of
                    suspicion on their part that we were trying to somehow take over their role. But
                    I think that we were small enough there that we could fairly well convince them
                    that we weren't trying to displace them either economically or politically or
                    militarily for that matter. We had a modest IMET program which gave us our
                    entr�e to the military but we didn't have any big military stakes at that time
                    in that country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about a military program? The French could have done
                        the whole thing. Why leave us a bit of the action?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: That's kind of a mute question regarding the period that I was there
                    because San Cara having just taken over wasn't sending anybody out. So, it was
                    more of a program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Usually IMET means bringing people to the United States
                        for training.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: That's correct. My job was to keep talking to them about it and to keep
                    planning and finding out when they were going to restart and so forth. But they
                    did not restart while I was there. But it was an interesting time. There were
                    four people who had made this coup who were all in positions of leadership. The
                    person who was the current president was very rarely in Ouagadougou. He was much
                    more of a military man and tended to stay at a base in the southern part of the
                    country where he was the commander. He wasn't very evident.</p>
                <p>My job was a little bit of everything. We only had the ambassador, the DCM,
                    myself, and a consular officer. That was it. I had two FSNs (Foreign Service
                    Nationals) working for me. One handled the self help program. We had one of the
                    biggest self help programs in Africa, $200,000 a year, and he ran the program
                    beautifully.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is where you give $500 or $1,000 to somebody to set
                        up a little store or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>LEADER: It was usually more than that. We built three classroom blocks. We would
                    help out with digging wells. We would provide funding and they would provide the
                    manpower. The way the program was managed, we never gave cash. We paid the
                    vendors. People would buy their supplies for whatever project they were doing in
                    Ouagadougou and then the bills would be sent to us and we'd pay the vendors.
                    That was basically the place where people got their supplies, so it worked out
                    well. Our FSN knew all of the suppliers and was on very good terms. He could
                    always tell if the bill that came in was too much because he had worked with the
                    projects for such a long time. That was very good. Interestingly enough, that
                    person retired and then they brought him back out of retirement. Last May, he
                    and his wife came to visit. They stayed at my house for two weeks while they
                    were going around seeing other people and other places. Twenty years later, we
                    were reconnected. The other FSN was doing economic reports for me because I
                    wasn't much of an economist. He later left and went to UNICEF. I lost track of
                    him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Burkina Faso? Was it split into tribal groups?
                        What was the predominant religion?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: It did have tribal groups. It also had some traditional rulers who still
                    had some standing in the community, the Mossi. There wasn't a lot of
                    cross-fertilization between the ethnic groups. Our Foreign Service national who
                    worked with our self help program came from the south from outside of
                    Ouagadougou and he could not speak the language. To this day, he does not speak
                    the language of Ouagadougou. When we would go out to the self help projects,
                    which was one of the great activities that I just loved doing, he was as
                    dependent on a translator as I was. He did not know the other local languages.
                    They needed the French as their lingua franca. Of course, a lot of people didn't
                    speak French because the educational system was so poor and the number of
                    illiterate people was so great. So there were these tribal differences. But I
                    never got the sense that they were really in competition. Burkina Faso has
                    virtually no resources. But I didn't get the sense that they were really
                    competing, cutthroat for what few resources there were. So there wasn't an
                    intense ethnic competition from my perspective. Maybe it was there, but I didn't
                    see it at the time. As far as religion is concerned, of course, Islam was the
                    major religion. There was some Christianity, but it was predominantly Islam. But
                    again, it wasn't an Islam that was trying to dominate the political, economic,
                    religious scene. It coexisted quite easily with the Christianity that was there
                    and with the local religions that also existed.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LEADER: I never found it a problem in Burkina Faso. I never had problems with the
                    people that I worked with or the contacts that I made.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we watching for the hand of Qadhafi from Libya in the

                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>LEADER: Yes, we were watching for it. I have always maintained that the person
                    with the strongest links of the four leaders was this military man who stayed in
                    the south and now has become the president. I think there was some training
                    going on. I could never verify it. But we know that later the space that he had
                    was possibly used to train dissidents from other countries in the area and we
                    know that he had a role in supporting Charles Taylor of Liberia eventually, who
                    had his Qadhafi connections. So, I think that there has always been a Qadhafi
                    connection. We may have closed our eyes to it more than we should have in some
                    instances. I wasn't following the policy closely.</p>

                <p>LEADER: That's correct.</p>
                <p>Speaking of Libya, Qadhafi came to Burkina Faso during my stay there. He always
                    travels with an entourage of female security guards. They all surrounded the

                </p>
                <p>LEADER: I went to the post that I had put on my bid list as an afterthought:
                    Lagos, Nigeria. I was initially very upset about having to go from one hardship
                    post in West Africa to another hardship post in West Africa when I was trying to
                    get out of Africa. I was trying to broaden my base and thought that by putting
                    Dhaka number one on my list that I would surely be able to go. I thought that
                    trying to get into South Asia would be a good entry point because there wasn't
                    much demand. It turned out that as soon as they saw my name on the list for
                    Lagos — the only name on the list for Lagos — I was assigned in the second week
                    of the assignment process without any prior consultation.</p>
                <p>It turned out to be one of my best assignments. I learned a lot about Foreign
                    Service reporting and I had a very good boss, Peter Chaveas, who is currently
                    the ambassador to Sierra Leone. It was a larger embassy, a bigger political
                    section. I had to learn not to do everything like I was doing in Burkina Faso
                    but to carve out a little niche for myself. I just had a great time there.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LEADER: I was there from 1985 to 1988. I actually left there in 1988 on a direct
                    transfer. I extended, but I left on a direct transfer in the middle of
                    spring.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1985 you arrive in Lagos. What was Nigeria like

                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>LEADER: In some ways, it was already somewhat dangerous. I recall that there were
                    some incidents that people at the embassy faced. One fellow had his car hijacked
                    at gunpoint. There were other incidents involving guns and foreigners and
                    Americans. It was an extremely lively place. The Nigerians loved talking to
                    foreigners. As a political officer it was so easy to get information because
                    everybody wanted to tell you their side of the story. If you didn't come to
                    them, they would come to you, because you had to know their point of view. But
                    while it was very easy to get information, the harder part was to assess it.
                    Everybody was telling you their particular side of the story. This was not long
                    after a coup. The president, Babangida, had come to power about six months
                    before I got there. He was promising a return to democratic rule and political
                    stability. The people who had been in charge of political parties were already
                    starting to maneuver. I had the good fortune of being sent up to Kaduna one
                    summer when there was a gap between the consul generals who were the principal
                    officers there. I was able to go around and talk to all of these would-be
                    political leaders and send in reports of their aspirations and what they were
                    envisioning. This was very welcome and very much appreciated throughout the U.S.
                    government. Those reports put Kaduna on the map at that time. It was a very
                    exciting time. The Nigerians in the south were very vivacious and fun loving.
                    They liked to have foreigners at their events, and when I say “events,” I mean
                    their weddings, their chief inductions, even deaths. They wanted you always to
                    come to their events and so we got involved in a lot of these kinds of things.
                    You really got into the culture.</p>
                <p>I worked with the Democracy Fund. By that time, we had the Democracy and Human
                    Rights Fund. I worked with people who were human rights activists. There was a
                    woman who was very involved? She was the Nigerian representative to the
                    African-American Institute and she was very involved in trying to reach out to
                    women on democracy. We funded a project that she had and funded some human
                    rights projects. We were very busy and very involved, very engaged.</p>

                <p>LEADER: Ibrahim Babangida.</p>

                <p>LEADER: It was after I left that everybody began to turn sour on him. While I was
                    there, we had hopes that he would do the right thing. He was delicately
                    balancing all of the various groups in Nigeria. You asked me about groups in
                    Ouagadougou where they existed but they were not combative. In Nigeria, the
                    groups were very competitive in trying to get access to the resources of
                    Nigeria, basically oil. Oil had already become the black gold of that country
                    and had pretty much drowned out agriculture. The country was now beginning to
                    import food. It was under the IMF (International Monetary Fund) program and it
                    was having a great deal of difficulty conforming to the expectations of that
                    program. We talked a lot at staff meetings about having the exchange rate be a
                    floating exchange rate.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LEADER: My particular portfolio was external affairs. I did the foreign ministry,
                    its UN involvement and so on. The part of my portfolio on which I spent a lot of
                    time and which was most interesting was religion. I was covering Christianity
                    versus Islam. That was just absolutely fascinating and so important even now to
                    the relationships of people in the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Islam spreading? Was there almost an agreed upon line
                        between the two religions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: Convention had iand I think that in general we could sathat the northern
                    half of Nigeria was Islamic and that the southwest was both Islamic and
                    Christian in the Yoruba area and that the north was the Hausa area and that in
                    the Ibo area it was overwhelmingly Christian. You did have that kind of rubric
                    to start out with. But certainly in the north there were a lot of pockets where
                    Christianity predominated, so as we saw more recently when they tried to impose
                    Sharia, there were a lot of people opposed because there were a lot of people
                    who are not Muslims. The thing that we found when we looked at iand this was
                    confirmed in a few articles in the newspaper very recentlEvangelical
                    Christianity was making inroads in the north-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is odd because normally you don't make inroads
                        against Islam.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>LEADER: Well, the Muslims were very upset by it. Christianity was attracting the
                    youth and it was offering people some answers to things that they weren't
                    getting in their own religion. They were trying to keep them out, but they
                    couldn't do it. Islam was kind of under attack from the other side because the
                    type of Islam that was practiced was the Sunni Islam and not fundamentalist or
                    radical in any way. There were some people coming in from more fundamentalist
                    groups. The Lebanese community was very big in the north and there were some
                    members of those families who were sending their youth over to Nigeria to work
                    in businesses that were owned by their extended families. They were bringing
                    with them some Shiite and fundamentalist ideas. Some influences came from Saudi
                    Arabia and elsewhere. And there were some riotthe Christian-Muslim riots.
                    Sometimes you weren't sure who was in charge of them, who was running them from
                    the Muslim side, whether they were going to turn on the Americans or anything
                    like that. The traditional leaders were not interested in attacking the
                    Americans at that point in time, but there was always that concern.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Qadhafi involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: I don't think Qadhafi had a great deal of influence and I don't think we
                    saw his hand in there. But the Muslims felt that the Christians were trying to
                    get rid of them and they felt the Christian ways of looking at thingthe
                    calendar, the work week, all of these things that were associated with the
                    Judeo-Christian worlwere being imposed on Nigeria. But the southerners felt that
                    the Muslims of the north were trying to take over the whole country. There was
                    an oft quoted phrase that the Muslims in the north had said that they were going
                    to dip the Koran in the sea, which was interpreted to mean that they wanted to
                    take over the entire country and make it an Islamic state. That friction is
                    going to continue for some time in Nigeria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about corruption?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: There was a lot of corruption, but I wasn't personally able to identify
                    or see a lot of it. I wasn't following that particular line.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about democratic institutions and the courts? How were

                </p>
                <p>LEADER: I think there was always a question about whether there could be a fair
                    trial or whether it would be colored by the desired political outcome. The group
                    that I was observing that was most often involved in courts were the
                    journalists, who were frequently having their newspapers closed down or being
                    arrested and held. Unfortunately, sometimes they would also be killed. There was
                    a lot of subterranean subterfuge going on. I had to do the human rights reports
                    as well. I just tried to report the way things were functioning, but I have to
                    confess that I don't know in great depth how the courts were managing.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LEADER: When I left, I thought that there was still some hope that the country
                    would in fact go back to some multiparty democracy. A constitution was being
                    written. The political parties were being allowed to form again. The leaders
                    were staking out their positions. Some of them had a broader view than others.
                    But it seemed that there was some sense that the country needed to continue as
                    one and so on. It was not long after I left that it tended to turn and it looked
                    as if Babangida was not going to follow through on his commitments and just let
                    them be pushed off and pushed off and pushed off until they were just
                    forgotten.</p>

                <p>LEADER: The first ambassador was Thomas Smith. He was very ill. His DCM was our
                    charg�. Don Gelber was the DCM who became the charg� for a considerable period
                    of time. Then Princeton Lyman came as our ambassador. He was the ambassador for
                    the rest of the time that I was there.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LEADER: I received a direct transfer to Geneva. It was part of a personnel deal
                    because my boss, Peter Chaveas, the head of the political section, was called
                    upon to be the consul general in Johannesburg and he moved to Johannesburg in
                    January. Then they identified the person in Geneva to come to take his place as
                    the political counselor and I was identified to go to Geneva to take his place.
                    We sort of did this little round robin. I was debating over my options for my
                    next post, but Geneva was my number one choice, so I was very fortunate.</p>

                <p>LEADER: The first two years that I was there, I was the number three person as a
                    refugee and migration officer. There was a section in the U.S. Mission in Geneva
                    that was called the Refugee and Migration Assistance Section (RMA). I had gone
                    to Geneva thinking that I would have the same portfolio as the person I
                    replaced, which was Asia, but it was decided when I got there that since I had
                    so much Africa experience, it was bad management if I wasn't assigned to Africa.
                    So I ended up doing all of Africa and most of Asia as well. Our main
                    interlocutors were the people who worked on those issues in the United Nations
                    High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the International Committee of the Red
                    Cross (ICRC), the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent
                    Societies. There were also a few other international organizations that had some
                    representation there. The United Nations Development Program (UNDP). Of course,
                    the International Labor organization (ILO), and the World Health Organization
                    (WHO) were also involved to the extent that they were relevant. There were some
                    non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and a couple of consortiums of NGOs with
                    which we related. So, it was very exciting work and the people who were working
                    on these humanitarian issues, because that's basically what we were doing was
                    the humanitarian issues, were just wonderful people from all over the world who
                    were attracted to UNHCR. ICRC at that time was wholly Swiss. Now that's not the
                    case. It was a wonderful group of people to work with and we had a great
                    time.</p>

                <p>LEADER: We answered to what at that time was called the Refugee Office.</p>

                <p>LEADER: No, we were not. But of course, the people that we reported to in Geneva
                    above our office were IO people. Our office related directly to the Refugee
                    Bureau. It had a director of refugee affairs at that time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LEADER: I can't remember the first guy, but the second ambassador was Morris
                    Abrams, who was there most of the time that I was there. There was another
                    political appointee before that. My initial supervisor was Mike Carpenter. I
                    worked with Dick Mann, who unfortunately died not too long after we finished up
                    in Geneva. After two years, I became the number two person in the office as the
                    deputy. At that time, my direct supervisor was Allen Drury.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LEADER: One of the biggest programs that we worked with was in Asia. It became
                    the Comprehensive Plan of Action to resolve the longstanding Vietnamese
                    boatpeople issue. This was a plan that was worked out among UNHCR, the donor
                    countries, and the countries of asylum where refugees were temporarily settled.
                    Under the plan, the refugees would resettle in other countries or to go back to
                    Vietnam. It was called Comprehensive because it was intended to resolve the
                    situation in Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia, Hong Kong, and the Philippines.
                    There were people in all of these areas that needed to have resettlement
                    options. The plan was worked out through a number of conferences. There were
                    always groups of delegations coming from Washington to Geneva to work on these
                    issues. Robert Funseth was the principal DAS of the refugee office at that time.
                    He led a number of these delegations and was very instrumental in getting the
                    whole plan put together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who would accept Vietnamese refugees? This was the crux of
                        the matter. The whole idea was to clean out the camps and get them set up
                        with a new life.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our instructions? Were we reluctant to take more
                        in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: We wanted to see a burden sharing situation where other countries would
                    also respond. We would not be the only ones shouldering the burden. Burden
                    sharing was definitely the principle on which the whole process was
                    grounded.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were the other countries responding to it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: There was a very good response throughout the world in the resettlement
                    countries. There are only about 15 countries worldwide that do resettle
                    refugeeprincipally in Europe of course, but Australia as well. It was a fairly
                    robust response from throughout the resettlement community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any particular problems that you had to face,
                        such as those that were not overly eager to take more in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: I don't remember being particularly involved in looking at that aspect of
                    it. There were a lot of issues and concerns around what would happen to those
                    who were not taken, who did not qualify for resettlement in another country.
                    Just because UNHCR declares somebody a refugee according to its criteria doesn't
                    necessarily mean that the person will qualify for resettlement in the United
                    States. There is always the problem of what happens to the residual caseload?
                    That was more a sticking point than getting other countries to step up to the
                    plate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There must have been quite a bit of pressure from the
                        countries who initially accepted: Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: Yes. They were always threatening to close the camps and send people back
                    against their will, trying to clean them out. This was particularly true in Hong
                    Kong, but Malaysia was very much in that mode. Of course, there were a lot of
                    very difficult situations in some of the camps. The camps on the Thailand border
                    were very much involved in trafficking in timber and things like this. There
                    were a lot of difficult situations in the camps and it was time that they be
                    closed but it had to be done in an orderly way. At the same time, we were
                    starting up the Orderly Departure Program from Vietnam for persons who had not
                    escaped through the boat route and who may have been in reeducation camps, but
                    who also may have been connected with the Americans at some point. So, this was
                    a program where, on an exceptional basis, refugees were being taken directly
                    from wherever they were located to the United States. Interestingly enough, a
                    similar kind of program is about to start up again. There are some in our
                    government who believe that there are still Vietnamese who did not make it into
                    that program before it closed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Vietnamese government a participant in these
                        negotiations?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>LEADER: Yes, they were a very integral player in all of this. That was one of the
                    things Bob Funseth worked on so very hard to bring them along and to get their
                    cooperation in this Comprehensive Plan so that they didn't feel that things were
                    being done to their people against the wishes of the Vietnamese government
                    itself. It was during that time that Bob Funseth would come to Geneva and meet
                    with delegations from Vietnam on the issue of the missing in action, the MIAs,
                    and he made a big breakthrough in that area as well. I was always the notetaker
                    at the luncheons he hosted. Everybody else got to eat except me and Bob Funseth.
                    That was really my role in many of these meetings: to be the notetaker whenever
                    more senior officials were in Geneva and to report on what transpired. My
                    reporting would then lead policy decisions in Washington about follow-on
                    actions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you see the role of the French in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: I don't honestly recall anything too exceptional. I can't remember the
                    substance of it, but at one point we had the interesting experience of having
                    dinner with Bernard Kuchner, the French Minister for their Humanitarian Affairs.
                    He was the founder of M�decins Sans Fronti�res, Doctors Without Borders. He had
                    a falling-out with them at some point and then he founded a second organization
                    called Doctors of the World or something, M�decins du Monde. As the leader of
                    M�decins Sans Fronti�res Kuchner had done some rather flamboyant, spectacular
                    things with the Vietnamessending boats out to rescue people at sea and all kinds
                    of things like this. I can't remember exactly the conversation, but there were a
                    lot of very strong statements on both sides. Our refugee director at the time
                    and Kuchner were going at it. But there was a willingness to try to come to an
                    agreement that would be acceptable to both sides.</p>
                <p>So that was basically the Asia portfolio.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did East Timor come into this at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: It wasn't very big on my radar screen. There were groups of Timorese,
                    liberation groups, but what was going on in Indonesia wasn't really on my radar
                    screen at that point. A lot of things should have been but you just couldn't do
                    everything.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>Africa was also a big issue. There were lots of different issues in Africa. At
                    that time, we were spending a lot of time on what was going on in the Horn of
                    Africa. Ethiopia was in a civil war with Eritreans who wanted independence. In
                    Sudan the SPLA (Sudan People's Liberation Army) of John Garang was fighting
                    government troops in the southern part to try to keep these troops out of the
                    south. At that time, there was a big push on the part of officers in our
                    emergency section of AID, Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), to
                    launch a humanitarian operation in the southern part of the country. This was
                    very controversial because of course the central government didn't want aid
                    going o people in the south. So, aid workers began flying in from Kenya and
                    going from Lokichokio into various places in the southern part of Sudan. We
                    worked on getting UNHCR to support this work and to harmonize with ICRC. I
                    always was impressed with ICRC because it had such innovative approaches to
                    problems. Instead of just bringing in food, it had a veterinary program to help
                    keep the cattle healthy. People's lives were so intertwined with cattle. There
                    was drought and war. So they had mobile veterinary stations that would go around
                    and keep the cattle healthy, which would then keep the people healthy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they mostly for milk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: The way the people kept their wealth was in cattle, so they were not
                    eating them so much as just having them for the milk and for other things that
                    they could get from the cattle. But eventually the UN operation, Operation
                    Lifeline Sudan, was launched. A lot of food was going in and helping the people.
                    There were UNHCR officers stationed in various areas southern Sudan. Their
                    presence had to be with the concurrence of the central government. It became
                    very dangerous. The government would hold some of the towns. Outside the towns
                    there was war and drought and it was very hard to get access to the rural areas
                    where there were so many millions of people who needed assistance. People were
                    trekking long distances from drought areas of the Sudan into Ethiopia. Refugee
                    camps in Ethiopia were working with UNHCR to ensure that these camps were being
                    run properly and that they had adequate resources to take care of the
                    people.</p>
                <p>And then there was Somalia, which had a number of large campthis time refugees
                    from Ethiopia. So you had refugees from Sudan in Ethiopia, refugees from
                    Ethiopia in Somalia. The refugees from Ethiopia were also in Sudan. This was a
                    very big area full of refugee problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your role in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>LEADER: My number one role was to keep on top of what was happening, what the
                    UNHCR was doing in these areas, what their policies were, and what their
                    financial needs were, and then to report this back to Washington. I recommended
                    funding options and where we should put our emphasis in using our resources. I
                    also made recommendations about how we might discuss with UNHCR our thoughts on
                    what would be a good way for them to go. We had some additional ideas about
                    their programs and so forth. I had long discussions with the head of their
                    Africa office about what they were doing and how they were doing it and whether
                    they were putting enough resources iinto northern Somalia in particular, where
                    there were a lot of difficulties. In Ethiopia, there were some rebels from
                    northern Somalia whom Ethiopian officials said had to leave the country. So,
                    they left the country. Where did they go? They went into the hills in northern
                    Somalia and started waging their rebel war there against Hargeisa and other
                    towns in northern Somalia, creating more displaced people. I recall that this
                    was before the government of Somalia totally collapsed. It seemed to me that a
                    lot of the food we were providing there became a resource that government
                    authorities were using to keep people on their side. They were using the food to
                    buy loyalty. There was considerable debate about whether or not UNHCR was going
                    to cut off its food assistance to people in various parts of Somalia,
                    particularly in the north. We didn't want them to cut it off just point blank,
                    but eventually they did. That coincided with the beginning of the collapse of
                    the government. When they didn't have the food anymore, it was a problem. They
                    didn't have any commodity to buy loyalty with and it disintegrated, the whole
                    network.</p>

                <p>LEADER: I'm sure that may have prompted some of the urgency we felt, but at that

                    were as large as they were in the Horn of Africa. Of course, the people from
                    Somalia were going into Kenya. I went to see some refugees in Kenya who were
                    Somalis as fighting picked up inside Somalia. But West Africa was fairly calm.
                    It hadn't really exploded yet. My respect for ICRC was reinforced when I talked
                    to them about what they were doing in West Africa. They said they had identified
                    West Africa at that time as being the next real trouble spot in Africa and they
                    were very worried about political stability. Houphouet-Boigny of the Ivory Coast
                    was getting old. What sort of succession was there in that area? They were very
                    worried about it. It was 1989 while I was there that Charles Taylor started his
                    rebel war to oust the government in Liberia and that became a very big focus of
                    ours. There was a lot of attention in the humanitarian community as people
                    started to be displaced in Liberia and across borders. I remember trying to
                    figure out if we could put food on the railway line and send it up into those
                    areas. Was the railway still functioning? It was run by a mining company. Had
                    the mining company left? I kept trying to figure out how we could get resources
                    into the country. I also recall having a discussion with ICRC about what it was
                    doing and its representative in Geneva said that he was in frequent contact with
                    his people who were actually already inside northern Liberia. They were coming
                    in from Cote d'Ivoire to the east and he was using some sort of a satellite
                    radio. I asked, “Aren't you worried about having other people pick up
                    information about what your plans are and what your strategies are?” He said,
                    “Oh, no, I have no problem at all. We talk in Swiss German and nobody in the
                    world understands it.” They were in very close contact. They had a lot of people
                    working out of northern Cote d'Ivoire. ICRC was also very good at building
                    contacts with key people. Taylor's brother was in Cote d'Ivoire. There were
                    rumors that he actually had a vehicle painted white like an ambulance with a red
                    cross on it. So ICRC sent out the word that they had to find this vehicle.
                    Apparently they did find it and they had a little chat with Taylor's brother and
                    told him he'd better stop using this ambulance-like vehicle with the red cross.
                    ICRC would try to maintain its neutrality and talk with people on both sides of
                    any conflict. They always had to cross lines to get to the people in need of
                    their assistance. So that was another big focus and it became a much larger
                    issue as time went on. Charles Taylor spread the word to Sierra Leone to try to
                    get access to the diamonds in that country. Guinea got drawn in and took a lot
                    of the refugees. It became a much bigger regional problem. When I was there 13
                    years ago we were focused on Taylor and Liberia. We were aware that he was
                    getting assistance from Burkina Faso and at that time Cote d'Ivoire, which had
                    to be complicit and knowledgeable about him.</p>

                        American side, did it make any difference where the refugees were or whom
                        they were fleeing from?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>LEADER: The short answer is, of course, no. U.S. funding goes not to governments
                    but to the international organizations and the NGOs that are helping in
                    humanitarian crisis situations. So, basically, our money went where UNHCR went
                    and UNHCR goes anywhere. Of course, it is helping in countries of asylum and if
                    it's an internal conflict, the Red Cross will actually be inside the country
                    helping the victims of the conflict. So we were not constrained by looking at
                    who was right or wrong or trying to make any judgment about the conflict. We
                    were looking at the victims of the conflict. It wasn't really the role of the
                    Refugee Bureau to get involved in conflict resolution or conflict prevention. In
                    fact, that has been an issue for some time that UNHCR has wrestled with, and
                    that is, to what extent should they be involved in the countries of origin? They
                    usually are working in the countries of asylum. What should they be doing in
                    terms of conflict prevention to keep people from crossing borders? What
                    involvement should they have in human rights, with people who are displaced who
                    haven't crossed borders? That became a big issue when we got into another
                    situation that happened when I was there: the Gulf War. There were so many
                    people who fled to northern Iraq and when fighting followed, they tried to cross
                    borders and fled into Iran by the hundreds of thousands. Turkey stopped them at
                    the border so they were blocked inside Iraq, displaced people in desperate need
                    of help. What was UNHCR's role? That was one of the first times that UNHCR got
                    involved in a big way with people who are called “internally displaced.” They
                    did go in and helped in that situation. Of course, the U.S. military was there
                    first.</p>

                        have their own dynamics. Was this like trying to herd kittens?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>LEADER: In the humanitarian arena, the NGOs need to get their funding from
                    somewhere. Some have independent sources. Oxfam tries to avoid using government
                    funding to the extent that it can. CARE often tries to, depending on the
                    situation. It sometimes makes judgments about the government's role in a
                    specific situation and then decides whether to take government money or not.
                    They often work in concert with UNHCR so that they're implementers. UNHCR has
                    staff in the field but not enough to do all of the things that need to be done.
                    The NGOs become the implementing agencies for UNHCR, working with the World Food
                    Programme (WFP). They become implementing agencies in many of these situations.
                    U.S. funding goes to UNHCR which then subcontracts with the NGOs. As money
                    became tighter and tighter, UNHCR often had gaps in what it could provide. More
                    recently, we've been providing a lot of funding directly to NGOs to operate in
                    parallel with what UNHCR is doing in the refugee areas. For example, an NGO
                    might be funded to set up a health clinic or school in a particular refugee
                    camp. It would do so in conjunction with UNHCR because UNHCR said it needed to
                    be done but UNHCR itself didn't have the resources to do it. There's still
                    debate as to whether the resources should go through UNHCR so it can supervise
                    and manage all of the NGO activities or whether the NGOs should be funded
                    separately. If so, this raises the coordination question because they shouldn't
                    be out there operating as independent entities.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Rwanda-Burundi cause any problems while you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: You asked before, were there other concerns that we should have had on
                    our radar screen? Quite honestly, it was a surprise to me on October 1, 1990,
                    when the Tutsi rebels, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), came across the border
                    militarily into Rwanda. At that time I was virtually ignorant of the situation
                    and the fact that there were refugees in southern Uganda, in Burundi, and some
                    in Zaire, who had been there for 30 years. This is not to say that I was totally
                    ignorant of the situation in these countries. I had followed Africa and I did
                    know that there were the Hutus and the Tutsis and that this was a problem. There
                    had been some massacres in Burundi which sent refugees into Rwanda. That was in
                    1989. I was sent from Geneva to help our embassies there to improve their
                    reporting and assessing of the situation. I worked with one of the junior
                    officers on the refugee portfolio. We went out to look at the situation on the
                    Rwandan side of the border and then I went to Burundi and looked from the
                    Burundi side of the border. Then I made a report to Washington with
                    recommendations about how to deal with gaps and what kinds of things UNHCR was
                    or wasn't doing, what ICRC was or wasn't doing, what the WFP was or wasn't
                    doing. I tried to build some capacity in both the embassies to continue
                    reporting on the ground.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>I also knew in 1988 there had been a conference in Washington with Rwandan
                    refugees and at that conference the refugees had declared they wanted to come
                    back to Rwanda. The response of the president was, “You can't come back. There's
                    not enough land.” I was partly aware of this because one of my colleagues in
                    UNHCR was a Ugandan born Rwandan descendent. He had come from the refugee
                    community in Uganda and was keeping me informed about these things. But it was
                    still a surprise to me to discover the extent to which the Rwandan refugees had
                    organized militarily with weapons and military prowess. They had military
                    expertise, and they were motivated to take this very momentous and risky step of
                    crossing over into another country and trying to wage a military fight. That was
                    one that did get away from us.</p>
                <p>Very quickly, UNHCR got involved in trying to build on the experience that they
                    had in Asia with the Comprehensive Plan of Action and sought to bring all of the
                    countries together where there were refugees. There was a conference about four
                    months after the invasion in January/February 1991 that was held in Dar Es
                    Salaam, Tanzania. UNHCR brought representatives from all of the countries in
                    conflict together as well as the donor countries. One of the people they sent
                    down there was Sergio Vera de Melo, whose name is now linked with Iraq and the
                    fact that he was killed in August in a bomb attack. At the time of the
                    conference I was encouraging him to try a Comprehensive Plan of Action
                    approach.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was one of the top UN diplomats. He was involved in
                        many things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: He got his start in UNHCR. When I started in the Mission in Geneva, he
                    was the head of the Asia Bureau in UNHCR, so we dealt with him on the
                    Comprehensive Plan of Action. He was the key UNHCR diplomat who put that thing
                    together tirelessly dealing with all of the various governments. He didn't have
                    much Africa experience as far as I know, but they pulled him in when there was
                    this need to bring all of the people together. He was so good at that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a concern during this time of how much are you
                        supporting refugees and how much are you supporting rebel forces? Food is a
                        weapon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: There was always some effort to provide accountability and be sure that
                    the food was reaching the intended beneficiaries. There were controls through
                    WFP, through UNHCR. Most of the time, we were fairly satisfied that it was
                    reaching the intended beneficiaries. Southern Sudan was a problem since the
                    rebels were the authorities and so they were in a position to exploit the
                    people. I think there was a big effort to keep the exploitation to an absolute
                    minimum and try to wipe it out altogether. But in certain situations, this did
                    become a problewhere the rebels would have access to the food resources that the
                    victims of the conflict were supposed to receive.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At one point some time later, you had these MREs [meals

                </p>
                <p>LEADER: Or as they said in Ethiopia, “Meals refused by Ethiopians.” I was
                    responsible for getting a million MREs after the Gulf War into Ethiopia for
                    people who were trekking back from the war against Eritrea after the cease-fire
                    there had been declared. The Ethiopians were trekking back from the north down
                    to Addis Ababa and we gave a million MREs to the ICRC to put at some feeding
                    stations along the way and they were then called “meals refused by Ethiopians.”
                    They ate them, but that was just sort of a nomenclature that we came up
                    with.</p>

                        got to be a bit careful with this type of food in that it's a military
                        commodity, where it's better to have large feeding stations which keep
                        people somewhat static so it won't be used by guerilla forces.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: I don't recall any discussions along those lines. Having MREs is fairly
                    unusual. They were stockpiled and ready to be used in Iraq before we went into
                    Iraq because they were portable. If there were big displacements of people the
                    military would be in a position to distribute them without getting involved in
                    food preparation and all of that kind of thing. But oftentimes, they're not the
                    food of first choice.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find that your work in humanitarian affairs

                </p>
                <p>LEADER: I think that the humanitarian approach of the Refugee Bureau has always
                    been accepted by the other parts of the government as being something that we
                    do. The challenge has been to make it more of an integrated approach where the
                    fact of refugees in a country becomes a critical policy issue for the rest of
                    our government. Sometimes this is not a foregone conclusion. It's not
                    necessarily a number one priority on the list of bilateral issues. That's been
                    one of the things that the Refugee Bureau does try to do, to move this issue
                    higher on the bilateral agenda so that we're looking more at conflict resolution
                    and conflict prevention so that there won't be the need for the humanitarian
                    response. But as far as the humanitarian response, once there is a need, it's
                    been pretty free of politics.</p>

                <p>LEADER: Just about the time that the Rwandan rebels crossed from Uganda into

                </p>
                <p>LEADER: The first ambassador with whom I worked was Ambassador Robert Flaten.
                    Much of his experience was with South Asia. He also had experience in Israel. He
                    often talked about how he saw a lot of parallels between the Rwandan situation
                    and Israel. The second ambassador I had was David Rawson. He was very much an
                    Africa hand. In fact, he grew up as a missionary kid in Burundi, spoke Kirundi,
                    which is practically synonymous with Kinyarwanda, and was able to use his
                    Kinyarwanda in Rwanda. He had already been stationed there once as a junior

                <p>LEADER: He retired. He served his three years in Rwanda, including going back
                    after the genocide, and was oftentimes under a great deal of suspicion by the
                    Tutsi who took power. I think they never liked the fact that he could understand
                    Kinyarwanda. Then he went as ambassador to Mali for three years. Then he retired
                    and is now in Michigan teaching.</p>

                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>LEADER: Rwanda was at a very exciting point in its history. The president had
                    been in absolute control of the country since 1973 when he made a coup against
                    the first president. This would be nearly 20 years later. He had declared that
                    the political process would be open, parties could form, there would be a new
                    constitution, a prime minister would be appointed, and there would be power
                    sharing in the government. It was a very exciting time. It was all in the
                    context of the French President Mitterrand's declaration at Baulay, where they
                    had a Francophone summit and he had urged the Francophone governments in Africa
                    to turn toward democracy. This was a kind of response to that more than it was
                    to any of our interests in democratization, but we certainly were supportive of
                    this move. Shortly after I arrived in Rwanda, the ambassador asked me to join
                    him at lunch with two of the leaders of one of the political parties. He was
                    very involved in this whole political process, advising the parties, responding
                    to them when they had questions, trying to keep everybody moving forward when
                    they felt they were getting blocked or bad things were happening between them
                    and the government or there were disagreements. He kept trying to push them to
                    resolve differences and to keep moving forward in this process toward elections
                    to create an elected government. But in the meantime there was to be a
                    multiparty government formed, bringing the opposition into the government. This
                    opening was happening in the political front. Human rights organizations were
                    being formed which we supported. On the journalism front, we were involved
                    through then USIS in supporting journalists to be responsible in their
                    opposition or in their criticism, not just to simply throw around critique but
                    to have a basis to report what was really happening. U.S. policy supported all
                    of these different openings in the society and as an embassy we were very
                    supportive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How stood Hutu-Tutsi relations?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>LEADER: About 15% of the population was Tutsi. But the government, what military,
                    what police there were, the security services were all monopolized by the Hutu.
                    There were quota systems for access to education. If you were a Tutsi, only 15%
                    of the Tutsi were going to get to go to university, or have access to primary
                    school. So the main avenues open to Tutsi were either businesand there were some
                    very successful Tutsi businessmeor the church. The church had a larger
                    percentage of Tutsi than was reflected by the size of the population. They were
                    about 40% of the church, the priests and so forth. People got along. Rwanda
                    doesn't have a lot of towns or villages. It's called the Land of a Thousand
                    Hills. People live on hills. Your community is your hill. But on these hills,
                    there were both Hutu and Tutsi living together. In the towns there were Hutu and
                    Tutsi living together. There weren't visible animosities but there were under
                    the surface suspicions. The Hutus in positions of power would say to me, “The
                    Tutsi are smarter than we are. We can't trust them. They will take over.” They
                    didn't feel comfortable. People told me that their parents told them they should
                    never take food from a stranger or from even their neighbors because it might be
                    poisoned. There was a lot of suspicion. Even the language had a lot of this? I
                    never learned to speak Kinyarwanda. It's a very difficult language. But the
                    translation of the phrase to express “Have a good night” or “Sleep well” was
                    something like “Sleep well and make sure that your enemies don't attack you.”
                    It's built into the society that there are enemies. Then the government did use
                    the radio to build up the idea that the Tutsis who were attacking the country
                    were evil people and that the Tutsis who lived inside the country were obviously
                    supportive of them. This was not necessarily the case. The Tutsis inside the
                    country didn't necessarily support a war against the government, and especially
                    now that there was this opening of the political process, they had a sense that
                    they could achieve some of their goals in the political transformation of the
                    country by peaceful means and they weren't necessarily supportive of the RPF.
                    But they were all lumped together. In the year before I got there, 8,000 Tutsis
                    had been simply rounded up and arrested and held in prison for up to six months
                    because they were considered to be accomplices of the rebels. It was just
                    assumed that if they were Tutsi then they were part of the rebel network. This
                    wasn't the case. Part of that is evident now in Rwanda where there is a kind of
                    a split between the Tutsis who have returned from exile after they took control
                    of the government and those who stayed throughout and never were in exile. They
                    don't see eye to eye and they don't trust each other. There is a lot of
                    mistrust.</p>

                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>LEADER: Most of the fighting was at the border. It didn't have a big impact on
                    life in Kigali at all. Most of the cities and the towns of the country were not
                    particularly affected by the war. It was taking place in rural areas along the
                    northern border between Uganda and Rwanda. The military pushed back the initial
                    thrust and the rebels had to cross back into Uganda. Then they sent mortars
                    across the border and troops into the country and they would attack some of the
                    social services like hospitals, schools, things like this. They were reputedly
                    taking some people captive and pressing them into service. It was somewhat
                    reminiscent of what was going on in Mozambique and RENAMO (Mozambican National
                    resistance). That was another big refugee situation when I was in Geneva, the
                    Mozambican one. So there was fighting going on and there were wounded soldiers
                    being brought back from the front. We knew this because helicopters would bring
                    them back at night and you would hear stories about that. There was real
                    fighting going on. And there was a considerable number of displaced people. The
                    government cleared out everybody within five miles of the border, just took them
                    out of that area. There were others who were subject to attacks. There were
                    camps set up in a certain part of the north. ICRC was helping to provide food
                    and shelter and water for these people. I was able to visit some of these camps.
                    It was mostly ICRC. UNHCR was not particularly in there at that time. UNHCR was
                    in the country and had been working out a solution to return the refugees which
                    the government accepted. All of this plays into what was the timing of this
                    rebel effort. It seemed that the democratization process was going to give the
                    Tutsis a role but not necessarily the role that they wanted. If you're a
                    minority, then you're not going to necessarily be in control. So there was some
                    speculation that because the refugees were now allowed to come back and the
                    democratization was going to give them a bigger role in the government, they had
                    to make their move because otherwise they would not have the kind of bargaining
                    position they wanted.</p>

                <p>LEADER: Well, in addition to being the DCM and seconding the ambassador in what
                    he was doing and managing the embassy and trying to liaison with USIS and with
                    AID and so forth, I was particularly following the human rights situation and
                    the other civil society development that was going on.</p>

                <p>LEADER: I didn't get out much, but I had a good friend who was with CARE who
                    would periodically invite me to come along with her. I did go out with her to a
                    number of places to see the problems that the war was posinthe refugee camps,
                    the impact that they had on the environment. They just stripped forests bare to
                    build their huts. I got around the country mostly to see refugee situations.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LEADER: The interest went as far as the Assistant Secretary for Africa.
                    Ambassador Cohen had come to Burundi when I was still in Geneva in the spring.
                    He came out and had a conference with ambassadors from those countries to talk
                    about what a solution might look like. I had been called down from Geneva to
                    attend that conference as well and provide the refugee perspective. So he was
                    interested in it from the start. His thrust was conflict resolution in a number
                    of places on the continent. Washington was a bit more involved in some of the
                    conflict resolution aspects of it where it was actually dealing with the rebels.
                    We in the embassy at this time didn't have contact with the RPF. The RPF was up
                    in Uganda and so people would go from Washington to Uganda and talk to them or
                    they would meet in some secret meetings in Zimbabwe or something. Oftentimes, I
                    wasn't even aware that some of these meetings were going on. We didn't see
                    highly classified intelligence in Rwanda because we had no Marines. We didn't
                    see highly classified communications of the Department. In some ways, we weren't
                    holding all the cards in the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Libyans messing around there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: Not in Rwanda. There was a small Muslim community in Rwanda and they did
                    have pretensions of an Islamic political party but their connections were
                    predominantly with Saudi Arabia, not with Libya. There was some Libyan activity
                    in Uganda at the time but the RPF was predominantly Christian. Christianity was
                    very strong in Rwanda. It was strong among the refugees as well. Islam was not a
                    big force.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about missionaries? Did you get involved with

                </p>
                <p>LEADER: The American missionaries were definitely part of our constituency. I
                    myself didn't have that much contact with them. Their contact with the embassy
                    was more through either the ambassador or a consular officer who was keeping
                    track. He initiallshe lateran the network of American citizens. We had a radio
                    network inside the embassy community and then we had one for Americans who were
                    outside the official community. We had to keep the same information flowing in
                    both networks. But we did have contact with the missionaries quite considerably.
                    We kept in touch with some of the particularly sensitive places.</p>

                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>LEADER: Maybe they were in that kind of contact with the ambassador. Once the
                    genocide started, I was definitely talking with some of the ones who were
                    calling in and telling us what was going on around the country. They did from
                    time to time let us know what was happening. They were a good source.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you sense when you got there there was concern that
                        you all might go through another Hutu-Tutsi genocide?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: Throughout the three years that I was there, mini massacres were
                    happening. No massacre should be minimalized by the word “mini,” but I say that
                    because in comparison to what happened in 1994, these were killings that went on
                    that were geographically isolated or restricted. They didn't spread. Maybe 300
                    people would be killed. It was always 300 people. Then it would stop. Nobody
                    would ever know quite why it started, who started it, what was the impetus, and
                    so on. These things would flare up in different places. Then they would go away.
                    The government would blame it on the RPF, who would blame it on the government.
                    There was a lot of insecurity at the time, too, because bombs were exploding in
                    marketplaces and on busses. Land mines were run over by trucks on roads. So, who
                    was doing all of this was never quite clear. There was never any accountability.
                    Nobody was ever found responsible for this insecurity and for these massacres.
                    In some of the massacres, I have to say that it didn't seem all that unclear to
                    us that the government or people close to the government were serving as agents
                    provocateurs. The first massacre that happened when I was there was south of the
                    capital in an area where there were a good number of Tutsis who had been
                    resettled from other parts of the country some years back. There were
                    indications that people were going around and saying that the Tutsis were going
                    to kill them, so they had to defend themselves and act before the Tutsis did
                    that. That was usually the line that was taken, that if you don't kill the
                    Tutsis, they're going to kill you. It was this kind of fear that prompted people
                    to pick up their machetes and execute their neighbors.</p>
                <p>But did we think that this was going to escalate into something worse? I guess we
                    were maybe naive but I don't think my mind could imagine such a thing. It just
                    couldn't fathom that that would take place. We did at the embassy keep our focus
                    on the positive developments, what we thought were positive developments, in
                    terms of the peace process and democratization, strengthening the political
                    parties, helping to facilitate the negotiations between the rebels and the
                    government when that got started. I was actually sent as one of the U.S.
                    observers to Arusha. I was expecting to go and be there for a short time and
                    sort of oversee the negotiations on the refugee situation. As it happened, I got
                    there when they were still discussing the military integration of the army,
                    integration of the gendarmerie, and that went on and on and on. So I was there
                    from April through June. The refugee matter was taken up in the middle of that
                    and took about five days.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the explosion happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: The peace negotiations had come up with agreements that did not satisfy
                    the hardliners in the president's entourage. Some of the hardliners broke away
                    and formed a hardline party. But that party was not necessarily the only center
                    of right-wing hardline opposition to the president's position. There was some of
                    this opposition around him. They blamed the negotiated settlements of political
                    power sharing for reducing the Hutu who had been in power to a minority
                    position. In the settlement, the Hutu in power were getting the same amount of
                    representation as the rebel Tutsis. Between those two blocks, there were the
                    opposition parties who were getting positions in the government. So, the
                    assumption was that all of the opposition parties would join with the rebel
                    Tutsis and make a bloc which would be able to outvote, outmaneuver, outdo
                    anything that the majority would want to implement. They would not be able to
                    influence the decision-making. The positions were assigned by political parties
                    and most of the political parties were opposition political parties. So, the
                    strategy of the government was to split those political parties so that they
                    wouldn't all go toward the Tutsi side and eliminate the opposition and try to
                    woo them back to the government's Hutu majority side. They were being quite
                    successful at that. As the peace process concluded and the agreement was finally
                    signed by the president, the political parties were in shambles. They could not
                    identify people to take seats in the new legislative assembly, to take positions
                    in the government, because they were split and this faction would want these
                    people and that faction would want other people. So implementation of the peace
                    accord was delayed and delayed and delayed because of this.</p>
                <p>Meantime, plans were underway for a more radical solution that was totally
                    outside this process. The more the obstacles to implementation were overcome,
                    the more the violence increased in the society. The peace accord was signed in
                    August. The UN peacekeepers arrived in October/November. There was considerable
                    violence around that time.</p>
                <p>I should just back up a little bit. There was something else that happened not
                    even in Rwanda. It happened in Burundi. Burundi was always run by the Tutsi
                    minority. What happened in June when the peace negotiations were still going on
                    was that Burundi had an election and the first Hutu president was elected. So a
                    Hutu president takes over in Burundi. This scares the Tutsis a little bit
                    because they see this kind of an alliance between these two countries as being
                    detrimental to their cause. But then in October, six months later, after the
                    peace accord was signed-</p>

                <p>LEADER: 1993. The Hutu president of Burundi is assassinated by the Tutsi
                    military. So the Rwandans who have been seeing this chaos in the political
                    parties in Rwanda have more ammunition. They say, “Look what happens when? The
                    Tutsis can't be trusted to participate in power sharing. They have killed the
                    president.” And massacres were also occurring. Bodies were floating down the
                    river into Rwanda. It was most gruesome. So this provided more ammunition to try
                    to woo Rwandan Hutus who had been in the opposition to Habyarimana and his
                    government back into the fold and the fold was getting stronger and more radical
                    and more “Hutu power” they called it. They called it the “power wings of the
                    parties.” Hutu power was getting stronger and stronger and stronger. The
                    moderates who had been in these opposition political parties were being forced
                    to choose. Were you going over to the RPF side or were you going to be with the
                    Hutu power? The polarization of the society was increasing. Violence was
                    increasing. Weapons were getting distributed to communities on the grounds that
                    they needed to be able to defend themselves. Even though there was a political
                    solution, a negotiated peace settlement, the radio was still talking about the
                    enemy, who were the Tutsis, and they weren't just the ones coming back from
                    outside, they were still linking those who were inside to those who had come in
                    from the outside. They were getting close to feeling that they were going to be
                    able to name this new multiparty integrated government and there were even 600
                    rebel troops that came into Kigali and the Counsel for National Development, the
                    legislature, became their barracks. They had a hotel attached to the counsel
                    room. This hotel, which was empty, was given over to them. It was on one of the
                    highest hills in Kigali and everybody felt very nervous about this, all the
                    Hutus. So, instead of leading to better relations between the ethnic groups, it
                    seems as if the peace settlement was exacerbating the conflict and polarizing
                    the society. The moderates that the embassy had been counting on to be able to
                    bring sanity and reason to this kind of mistrust and so forth was
                    disintegrating. They had never had a strong leader and they were just
                    disintegrating. So, then some group or another made the decision to shoot down
                    the president's plane when he was returning from a conference in Tanzania where
                    the Tanzanians were putting a lot of pressure on the president to resolve the
                    last remaining hurdle and get on with implementing this new government and the
                    peace accord. He had agreed at the conference to do that. I think the people who
                    did not want that to ever happen made sure that he wasn't going to be able to
                    lead that implementation.</p>

                <p>LEADER: The ambassador was involved on a 24-hour seven-day basis in trying to get
                    all sides to the point where they could implement the peace process. We were
                    supporting implementation with all our effort and all of our resources. That was
                    our major goal at the time. I was continuing to keep contact with the civil
                    society folks and the human rights folks and journalists and other people in the
                    society and participants in the political parties and so forth.</p>
                <p>At this time also, an independent radio station started up. It was called RTLM,
                    or the Radio Television Libre Mille Collines, Free Thousand Hills. It was
                    started up by Hutu hardliners. It was broadcasting a lot of propaganda against
                    the journalists, against the human rights advocates, against the people who had
                    negotiated the settlement, and against the enemy (the Tutsis). We were talking
                    to the government about trying to rein this group in, which we now called hate
                    radio. They simply said, “Well, it's a free country and it's a free radio and
                    the government has nothing to do with it and we have no control over it.” It was
                    a very, very difficult situation. A few weeks before the president's plane was
                    shot down, a political party leader was assassinated outside of his home. For
                    the first time, one of these “mini massacres” happened in Kigali. The people who
                    brought the fear and the terror to the people of the capital for the second time
                    (a year earlier the Tutsis had broken the cease-fire and almost captured the
                    capital), at this point, they were very scared about massacres spreading.</p>

                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>LEADER: We had gone to evacuation a year earlier when the rebels had almost
                    captured Kigali but for the intervention of the French. People had come back
                    three months later. We continued our weekly security briefings of the community.
                    We were keeping people very well informed about what was going on and what the
                    risks were. But at that particular point in time, we weren't anticipating having
                    to flee or there being a big eruption. Between the time that this political
                    party leader was assassinated in February and April when the plane of the
                    president was shot down, we had several high level visitors from Washington
                    again putting pressure on the government to resolve the obstacles to
                    implementing the peace process. So we were still looking to the positive,
                    looking to the solution, looking to the resolution, believing that once this
                    framework for a new government was put in place, that this violence could be
                    controlled, the dissidents would be brought in, they would see this was the only
                    game in town and so they would come into the process. It just didn't work like
                    that. We were totally mistaken. Of course, we knew very quickly after the plane
                    was shot down. The next morning, I awoke to gunfire. I think others did as well.
                    I was getting calls from 7:00 AM telling me that the political moderates who
                    were in the opposition to President Juvenal Habyarimana and who favored the
                    peace accord were being systematically killed. I knew there were forces going
                    house to house in some of the Kigali neighborhoods killing Tutsis. Right off the
                    bat we had the killing of the Hutu moderates, not just Tutsis, and also ordinary
                    Tutsi citizens were being slaughtered. That was evident before 10:00 AM. By that
                    afternoon, we were hearing that the RPF might start to move its forces down from
                    the north. There were rumors that forces already in the area were breaking out
                    of the compound they were in, but I don't know to this day if that was true. But
                    forces did start moving down from the north. By the next day, it was clear that
                    Kigali could become the venue not only for killing Tutsis and killing Hutu
                    moderates, but also renewed civil war, which had not happened in Kigali up to
                    that time. So, we decided, and Washington decided, that it would be best if we
                    evacuated.</p>

                <p>LEADER: When we were talking about Geneva, you asked me what the primary issues
                    were that we were dealing with at that time. There were two that I neglected to
                    mention that were fairly important. One was the fact that Namibia had become
                    independent and there were a number of refugees who had fled into Angola and
                    some into Zambia but primarily into Angola. They were now poised to return. The
                    State Department was working with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees to try
                    to figure out a strategy for getting them back. This was all happening within
                    the framework of a UN plan for the independence of Namibia that included some
                    very innovative kinds of arrangements that are still cited today by our current
                    Assistant Secretary for Refugee Affairs as a model for how to organize a
                    post-conflict independence situation. The UN was clearly in charge. There was a
                    small force that it had at its disposal for security but my focus was primarily
                    on the refugee return itself. I was working with the special office and its
                    office director within the UNHCR. He was working very closely with people both
                    in Angola and in Namibia in order to organize the transport back which was going
                    to be overland and then to organize the reception when the refugees arrived at
                    their points of origin, their villages and their localities. Quite honestly, it
                    turned out to be a very smooth operation. I think that the reception and the
                    reintegration went very well. So, I give high marks to UNHCR. The role of the
                    U.S. was funding and then to try to make sure that UNHCR was covering all the
                    bases and that everything stayed on track. We were very pleased with that
                    operation.</p>
                <p>As far as Mozambique is concerned, I can't remember the magnitude of the numbers
                    in that case, but I think it was maybe a little less than even 100,000. But in
                    the case of Mozambique, there were a couple million Mozambicans who had fled
                    their country primarily into Tanzania. There were camps set up. They had
                    experienced very traumatic things with the rebels, who were very vicious. Their
                    tactics were precursors of some of the things that went on later in Rwanda and
                    some of the things that have gone on more recently in Liberia and Sierra Leone.
                    They were very vicious in their treatment of the people in the villages that
                    they took over. So, people fled en masse to get away from them and there was a
                    very big refugee operation going on in southern Tanzania. The question was,
                    would they voluntarily return? Return always has to be voluntary under the
                    international agreements that give UNHCR the mandate for managing such returns.
                    Are you voluntarily going to return to where you've been brutally assaulted?</p>

                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>LEADER: While I was in Geneva, there was an ongoing peace process that was
                    primarily being managed by St. Egidio, a religious group in Italy associated
                    with the Vatican. It was St. Egidio that was sort of mediating this conflict. I
                    guess part of it was fairly confidential. It wasn't getting a lot of media play.
                    They were trying to keep that element of influence out of it and get the parties
                    to work together. They were coming to an agreement. I'm not all that familiar
                    with the agreement that they did reach. But it was one that gave the rebels a
                    stake in the government so they did agree to lay down their arms, to cease and
                    desist. This commitment was kept. Unlike Angola, which went back to civil war
                    after a peace agreement was reached, the leaders of the rebel group in
                    Mozambique kept their commitment and ceded the authority to the central
                    government and then began to work within that framework. But it was a mass
                    return. I think the U.S. was very instrumental, although I left before a lot of
                    the people had returned. We were simply working on getting it set up. I think
                    the U.S. and AID and its Office of Transition Initiatives were very instrumental
                    in making the return sustainable so that the people would not leave again as
                    soon as they got back to their villages because of lack of opportunities for
                    employment or ability to work the lands and so forth. Most of them were farmers
                    in the farming area. So, that was again a very big success story where the
                    people have become an important part of the reconstruction of the country.</p>

                    food from the international community and probably also did some subsistence
                    farming around where they were stationed. Some of those details I don't

                <p>LEADER: I don't think we thought there was hope that the French would intervene.
                    It was not our policy to support French intervention in Rwanda. There were
                    agreements between the Rwandan government and the French and we more or less
                    stayed clear of pronouncing one way or the other. It's true that the French had
                    come to the rescue of the government throughout this crisis with the Tutsi RPF
                    invaders from Uganda. This started right away after the invasion in October
                    1990. Both the French and the Belgians sent troops. The Belgians withdrew their
                    troops after 30 days. It was very controversial in Belgium about coming to the
                    aid of that government. But the French never left. Of course, they were there
                    ostensibly to protect their citizens. There were about 600 French citizens in
                    Rwanda, some engaged in business, others engaged with the government, and many
                    with the military. The French had a great deal of military assistance going into
                    Rwanda. One of the provisions of the peace accord reached between the rebels and
                    the government that was signed in Rwanda in Arusha in August 1993 was that the
                    French troops would withdraw. But in fact about six months prior to the
                    agreement the French augmented their troops because the RPF broke the cease-fire
                    and launched an assault toward Kigali that came within 20 miles of the capital.
                    So, they augmented their forces and were manning roadblocks on the access routes
                    into Kigali. Yet, part of the peace agreement was that they would leave. They
                    did this finally in December 1993. This was just weeks before the RPF brought a
                    battalion into Kigali which was scheduled to provide protection for the Tutsi
                    RPF members who were going to participate in the government when it got set up.
                    But of course it never got set up, not at that point in time. So, at the time
                    the president's plane was shot down the French had very few troops, if any, left
                    in Rwanda. At that time, they had a base in the Central African Republic and
                    they sent some troops down explicitly for evacuating their citizens. They
                    provide armed escort for French people who were going from their assembly points
                    to the airport to pick up planes that would take them to France. It was
                    subsequent to this evacuation when the RPF had made considerable advances toward
                    Kigali and the Hutu government that was committing the genocide was on the run
                    that the French got permission from the UN Security Council to launch what was
                    called Operation Turquoise. Operation Turquoise was a plan to rope off a portion
                    of southern Rwanda which the RPF had not yet reached and use troops from
                    Francophone African countries to provide protection for people in that zone. Of
                    course, that made the zone a magnet for all what were subsequently called
                    “genocidaires,” the people who were committing the genocide. The French
                    essentially became protectors of the killers. This was a contribution aimed at
                    protecting the people from the killing that was going on, both the genocide and
                    the civil war.</p>

                <p>LEADER: The French were very hardline with the government against the RPF and
                    against the invasion. The question is always asked, why did the French take such
                    an interest in this small African country? After all, it wasn't a French colony;
                    it was a Belgian colony. And how did it happen that they more or less supplanted
                    the Belgians in terms of support for the government in place. A lot of theories
                    have been launched. The one that's simplest and the one that seems to be most
                    accepted is that they did not like the prospect of Rwanda possibly falling into
                    the Anglophone orbit. The Tutsis who grew up in Uganda spoke English and they
                    grew up in an Anglophone setting. They saw the U.S. behind the RPF. Whether or
                    not that was true didn't seem to matter. I don't think we were providing any
                    support to the RPF for its activities at that time. We were talking to them, but
                    we weren't providing them any support. But the French were very suspicious of
                    U.S. motivations, of Anglophone motivations, so they kept a very strong hold
                    there. They were very partisan to the Habyarimana government and to many of the
                    people who were instrumental in not only keeping it going but also to some
                    extent promoting the concept that the Tutsis were the enemy, people like that,
                    the anti-human rights people. The people who didn't like the prospect of the
                    democratic change that was coming found support from the French.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did our embassy there have many dealings with the French

                </p>
                <p>LEADER: I'm sure that in Washington there were frequent meetings between the
                    French officials for Africa and the American Assistant Secretary for Africa.
                    There were established periodic meetings. So that contact was consistently used.
                    I'm sure that Rwanda was on the agenda, although we didn't necessarily see the
                    reports of these kinds of meetings. When we were in Rwanda, we didn't have
                    Marines and so we were unable to receive anything that was highly classifieNODIS
                    or something like thawe would never see. But in Rwanda itself, the ambassador
                    had very good relations with the French ambassador. I had very good relations
                    with the number two, the deputy. I met periodically, almost monthly, with the
                    DCMs from both the French and the Belgian embassies. We had very cordial
                    relations but we weren't always on the same wavelength.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As this developed, were we looking toward the government

                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>LEADER: We didn't see that they were promoting a genocide. We knew there was
                    resistance to implementing the peace accord. In the six months before the
                    genocide which came after the signing of the peace accord, our primary focus
                    diplomatically was on removing the obstacles to implementing the peace accord.
                    We were working very closely with the entire diplomatic community and there was
                    a substantial African diplomatic community there. The leadership fell to the
                    representative of the Vatican. He was the head of the diplomatic community, the
                    nuncio. He would call the meetings and get people together. We worked with not
                    only the French and the Belgians - the English were not there - but also with
                    the Africans and the Tanzanians. The Tanzanians played such an important role in
                    facilitating the peace accord and had a very prominent role in the diplomatic
                    community. They were working with the two sides to try and bring the peace
                    accord to fruition. Through this group we did call the government on its
                    distribution of weapons. I was in a meeting where this happened. The nuncio said
                    to the president, “Mr. President, this is just not odd, this distribution of
                    weapons.” The president basically avoided the question by going back to the
                    issue of security for people in villages. He recalled that initially when the
                    RPF had invaded, they passed out weapons to villages in the border areas but
                    those weapons had since been retrieved. He just totally sidestepped the issue of
                    what was happening at the moment, which was substantial. So, we never saw a
                    genocide coming. That was just beyond our comprehension.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The genocide really blew up after the president's plane
                        was shot down?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: The genocide was launched after that, yes. The shooting down of the plane
                    was the trigger that started the actions of the groups who were trained in the
                    capital to do a very rapid and brutal killing with what they called “les armes
                    blanche,” not even guns, but machetes. In fact, in one of the stories which I
                    don't think is a story, people were actually paying to be killed by a bullet
                    rather than to be killed by a machete. It was horrendous. Whether the violence
                    would have been launched by some other trigger, my feeling is, yes, it could
                    have been a different trigger. But it just so happened that the president's
                    plane became the trigger for launching the genocide and killing the opposition
                    and renewing the civil war.</p>

                        that it was really too late for intervention?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>LEADER: No, it was not too late for intervention. Immediately after the killing
                    started our policy was to call for the killing to stop. Once the civil war was
                    renewed we urged renewal of the cease-fire and an end to the fighting. So, it
                    was stop the killing, stop the fighting, let's get back to talking. But at the
                    same time, there was the issue of the UN force that was already in the capital.
                    There were approximately 2,500 troops under the aegis of the United Nations
                    headed by a Canadian general, General Romeo Dallaire. His rules of engagement
                    forbade him to initiate any kind of action against the people who were
                    committing the killing. He could only respond if his troops were directly
                    threatened like if somebody raised a gun and pointed it at them. Otherwise, they
                    could be standing right beside a checkpoint and people would be committing
                    crimes, killing people, but they couldn't do anything to stop it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who set up the rules of engagement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: The Security Council set up the rules of engagement. And at this time,
                    the Security Council was under pressure from the Belgians, who had had 10 of
                    their peacekeeping troops slaughtered the first morning after the plane went
                    down. These were troops who were going to the prime minister's house to provide
                    her protection. They never got there. They were instead kidnapped and taken to a
                    military camp where they were brutally killed within hours. So the Belgian
                    response was to withdraw all of its forces from the Rwandan peacekeeping
                    mission, known as UNAMIR. They urged the other governments to do the same. So
                    there was pressure on the U.S. not to enlarge the peacekeeping mission. This was
                    the issue that was before the Security Council: to enlarge or not to enlarge the
                    peacekeeping mission or to give it different rules of engagement. Madeleine
                    Albright was our UN ambassador at that time. She was instructed by Washington to
                    say that we were not in favor of enlarging; we were in favor of reducing. In
                    fact, General Dallaire got left with 500 troops.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was your mission playing any role in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: Our mission was gone. The embassy was closed. The French were gone, the
                    Belgians were gone, the U.S. was gone, the Africans, everybody was gone. All of
                    the diplomats had evacuated. I believe that a couple of Tanzanians actually
                    stayed at least for a while to try to get things back on track. But pretty much
                    everybody left. So it was really Washington that was operating now. There was
                    very little intelligence coming out of the country because nobody was there to
                    provide it. We were in touch with people who were in the country and certainly
                    our Deputy Assistant Secretary was talking by telephone regularly with the
                    people who were running things.</p>
                <p>

                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>LEADER: There was this military guy, Bagosora, who had been the chief of the
                    defense staff. He was one of the key people in terms of organizing and
                    implementing the genocide. But there was also a new president named and a new
                    prime minister. So from Washington the Assistant Secretary was talking to those
                    people. I was initially talking to some of the humanitarian types. The
                    International Committee for the Red Cross stayed. There were Swiss people who
                    stayed to help with the aftermath of the killing. But the diplomatic action was
                    at the UN and it was over this question of whether there would be more troops or
                    not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It really does sound like a matter of washing our hands of
                        the whole thing and saying, “Let the slaughter go on. It's not our
                        business.” I'm talking about the UN, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: It was a very emotional time and it was very divisive within the
                    government. I personally do not believe based on some things that some people
                    who were at the UN have told me that Madeleine Albright favored that solution,
                    but she was instructed and that was what she had to do. There was also the issue
                    of whether or not this constituted genocide and if we called it “genocide,”
                    whether we would be obligated to act under the Genocide Convention. Our legal
                    people said that we had to say this was not genocide, that there were acts of
                    genocide that had been committed but whether or not it was genocide hadn't been
                    determined. I think one of the first people in our government to use the term
                    “genocide” was Geraldine Ferraro, who headed the U.S. delegation to a special
                    session of the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva. That was at the end of May
                    and she used the word “genocide.” She called it like it was. It was a little
                    difficult to walk the cat back after that happened. She was representing the
                    U.S. government. Then George Moose, the Assistant Secretary, went before
                    Congress in June. The term at that point was “the acts of genocide” had been
                    committed. That was as far as we would officially go even though Geraldine
                    Ferraro had gone a little farther.</p>

                <p>LEADER: For the six weeks after I got back, I was working in the Department in
                    the Central Africa Office, mostly writing SITREPs, daily situation reports, for
                    the office and bureau leadership. There was already a desk officer and a chain
                    of command, so we were just adjuncts. Mind you, it's important to remember that
                    the embassy consisted of a total of eight Americans: the ambassador, myself, and
                    one substantive officer, who was an econ/consular officer. The other people were
                    admin or communications. So we're not talking about a lot of people. The
                    substantive officer and myself were in AF/C (Office of Central African Affairs).
                    I was also focused on the humanitarian aspect. I was asked to head up an
                    interagency meeting to look at what was happening in the humanitarian situation.
                    We participated in several of the policy debate sessions that were headed by the
                    Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, Pru Bushnell. I did that for six weeks. At
                    that point, that was the end of my tour. I had another assignment. I took some
                    vacation and then started in July in a new assignment in West Africa.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LEADER: Rwanda had not really been on the radar screen of people unless they were
                    involved with Africa. There was a DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency) guy who said
                    it sort of happened and he had to learn real fast where Rwanda was and what it
                    was all about. Probably the CIA analysts, the INR analysts, and the State
                    Department Africa Bureau were about the only ones interested. The killing did
                    come a little bit out of the blue to other people. They didn't really have the
                    history of what were the roots of this conflict. So it did look like it was just
                    a bunch of Africans killing each other. It was very difficult for us. The
                    government didn't know what to do. I would also recall that this was the time
                    when Presidential Decision Directive (PPD) 25 went into effect. That was a White
                    House decision, a policy decision directive, about peacekeeping. For some time
                    now, the U.S. government has been very wary of becoming involved in peacekeeping
                    actions, particularly in Africa but elsewhere as well.</p>

                <p>LEADER: Somalia pushed the antagonism toward peacekeeping operations further and
                    I think precipitated this particular directive becoming institutionalized. It
                    said that if you went in, you had to see an endpoint and it had to be for some
                    very specific reasons. And so the whole atmosphere in the U.S. government was
                    very antithetical toward getting involved and doing anything. Later, I read a
                    conference report that indicated that a few thousand troops or less, a few
                    hundred troops, might have been able to turn the tide because the killers were
                    amateurs. They were motivated and they were organized, but they might have been
                    stopped. It was the assessment of this conference that looked at the killing
                    from the military perspective that it probably could have been stopped if there
                    had been some intervention in the first 10 days or so after the onset of the
                    killing. If the truth be known, there were 300 U.S. marines were moved from a
                    ship off of Somalia up to Burundi poised to come in to help us evacuate if
                    necessary. We did not need them to come into Rwanda as it turned out, but they
                    were in Burundi poised to help if we asked. There were also French and Belgian
                    troops who came to make it safe for their people to leave. So there was pretty
                    much firepower around to draw on if there had been any instructions or will to
                    do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get out?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>LEADER: The Belgians and the French brought troops into the country and had
                    airplanes landing at the airport, to evacuate their people. I actually spoke
                    with the French. They said, “We can look at your situation after we take care of
                    ours.” So, those folks were focused on their own citizens. There were about 600
                    French and about double that number of Belgians. So they weren't going to get
                    around to us anytime soon and we realized that we had to rely on ourselves. It
                    seemed that without some kind of military assistance, we couldn't get to the
                    airport because we would be crossing battle lines. If we went with the French,
                    they were considered pro-Habyarimana government. If we went with the Belgians,
                    they were considered pro-RPF. So we thought that maybe we had a better chance of
                    being independent. We finally assessed that our best shot was to take the road
                    south to Burundi. At that time, the killing had not spread south of Kigali.
                    There were reports of killings north and east but not really south. We had
                    already identified assembly points. Because we had been having security
                    briefings regularly with our community, other Americans knew where those
                    assembly points were. We couldn't discuss anything without involving everybody
                    because we were using our two-way radios. Everybody could listen in if the
                    ambassador and I were discussing something. If the embassy people were
                    discussing, everybody was listening. So they all had a say from their
                    perspective about what looked best to them. They all agreed that it was best to
                    just go by road. We spent a lot of time trying to get some sort of authorization
                    from the government side to give us safe passage and we succeeded. It just so
                    happened that our defense attach� was there. He and our consular officer made it
                    to the embassy on Friday, two days after the plane was shot down. They managed
                    to get a commitment of safe passage and a couple of gendarmes to accompany any
                    convoys out of town. The decision was made on Friday morning that we would
                    evacuate and we only had that day to organize. By that time, most of the people
                    in the missioAID, us, missionariehad lost power. We could only have electricity
                    if we put our generators on. That meant that to recharge the radios, we all had
                    to have the generator on. Some Americans were caught in a crossfire on Thursday
                    night, so they really did feel that it was time to get out. We think this
                    particular crossfire, by the way, was internal fighting between branches of the
                    military inside Kigali at that point. We sent two convoys on Saturday and two on
                    Sunday and they all made it safely to Burundi. Some of them had some stories and
                    it took them quite a long time past midnight to make it all the way there, but
                    they did. On Monday the first convoy went. The ambassador's wife was in that
                    convoy with their car and there was some concern that they wouldn't be able to
                    get across the bridge out of town, that it might have been blown up or
                    something. They went anyway because how could we get any intelligence unless we
                    went? So, they went down there and they found that it had not been blown up and
                    it was still passable, so they went across and then about 1:00 PM, our convoy,
                    the last convoy, went. I closed the door of the embassy and we left. The
                    ambassador and I were in the last car of the last convoy until we got to the
                    bridge and they told us we had to be the first car. We had a 107 car convoy. I
                    counted them when we got to the border. Of those 107 cars, there were only nine
                    Americans. There were Omanis, there were all of the African diplomats, there
                    were a number of Germans, some other European governments that weren't Belgian
                    or French. It was slow going, but we made it with no serious incidents.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was basically Tutsis killing Hutus, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: No, no, Hutus killing Tutsis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Then Tutsis trying to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: No, we didn't really have that happen. When we got to the bridge in my
                    convoy, there was one incident in which the military guards accused one woman of
                    being Tutsi and said she would have to get out of the convoy. She happened to be
                    the wife of a Tanzanian diplomat. I think she probably was a Tutsi. As you know,
                    there were a lot of Tutsis who were in refugee camps in Tanzania. It was quite
                    possible that they had met somehow in Tanzania. But anyway, it was our
                    ambassador who kind of saved the day. He spoke Kirundi, very close to
                    Kinyarwanda. When he saw that they weren't getting anywhere, he went over to see
                    what was the problem because we wanted to get the convoy moving again. He told
                    me later that the military said, “Well, she's a Tutsi. We know she's a Tutsi
                    because she speaks Kinyarwanda.” And the ambassador looked at them and said,
                    “But I speak Kirundi and you're not going to say that I'm Rwandan, are you?”
                    They sort of looked blank and had to agree that he had a point and that just
                    because she spoke Kinyarwanda didn't necessarily mean that she was a Rwandan. We
                    did get her out of that scrape. We moved on. Most people who were threatened by
                    that time were in hiding. As a matter of fact, I had been in contact with a
                    friend who was a lawyer and a human rights advocate. We'd been in touch up until
                    Saturday morning. By Saturday morning, all contact with him stopped. He went
                    into hiding. I later heard his story because he did survive. But most people
                    were in hiding by that time. Mille Collines was already beginning to be a
                    rendezvous point. People were fleeing to that hotel or to churches to try to
                    save themselves.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm surprised that there weren't more people coming to the
                        American embassy and saying, “Get us out of here.”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>LEADER: Well, we were in touch with some of our Foreign Service nationals who
                    worked for us and told them what we were doing and what arrangements we were
                    making for them to continue to be paid and that we would be coming back as soon
                    as possible. But they were mostly in their homes or in hiding. We had no way of
                    taking them with us. It was very distressing, but we didn't. It was something
                    that we didn't like having to do, but we did have to do it. There were a number
                    of Rwandans who were part of the government who went to the French embassy and
                    were evacuated by the French to France. I heard that story from a Rwandan who
                    was a human rights advocate. He was more than just a human rights advocate. He
                    founded the first human rights organization. He lived very close to the French
                    embassy, so he went there as soon as things started because he knew he would be
                    marked. In fact, he was marked. The people who lived in the house that he had
                    lived in before he had moved were killed. His house had been marked, but it
                    wasn't his house anymore. They just killed the people who were in iHutus. He
                    went to the French embassy and he was appalled because all of these
                    pro-Habyarimana, pro-genocide perpetrators and so forth were in the French
                    embassy. They didn't want him to get on the plane. They did not want him to be
                    evacuated with them. As a matter of fact, the plane stopped in Bujumbura before
                    it went on to France and he got off because he wasn't going to be evacuated to
                    France with all those people and be associated with all them. So that was a big
                    issue and it caused a lot of Americans anguish, because they had to leave behind
                    people who worked for them in their homes, people that they worked with in their
                    places of work whether they were in UN organizations or in the embassy or in AID
                    or whatever. We all think about that a lot.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You moved where? You went to another place.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: We went to Bujumbura, Burundi, which was usually a five hour drive but in
                    fact took us 10 hours to get there. And from there, we were evacuated by one of
                    the military planes that was in Burundi to Kenya. Then from Nairobi, we flew
                    commercially home. People were then in evacuation status. Most were
                    reassigned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were reassigned after about six weeks?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>LEADER: Yes. I started my work as a deputy director in AF/W (Office of West
                    African Affairs) in July. But at the beginning of August our ambassador, David
                    Rawson, went back to do an assessment of whether we should be reopening our
                    embassy. This was after the killing, the genocide had stopped, the RPF Tutsis
                    had captured Kigali, they had won the war militarily, the Hutu government was
                    defeated, and had actually run into exile and taken a million people with them
                    into Zaire. In the refugee camps in Zaire, cholera broke out and so now we are
                    ready to respond. Now we have a humanitarian situation and we respond by sending
                    in the military to set up some kind of safe water to stop the cholera from
                    spreading. The embassy flag was raised and the military set up its headquarters
                    at the airport in Kigali. But the ambassador had to come home because he didn't
                    expect to just start work out there, he was only on a reconnaissance mission. So
                    they asked me to go back and I went from the middle until the end of August. I
                    would say that has to be one of the hardest two weeks of my life, going back and
                    finding a city that was totally emptied of most of the people I knew. They had
                    all fled and hadn't come back yet for the most part. There were new people
                    there, Tutsis coming up from Burundi, for example, and they were identifiable
                    walking on the streets. Of course, all the cars had license plates from Burundi.
                    So it was like the city had been turned inside out. But my marching orders were
                    to try to convince the government - and this was now the Tutsi-led government
                    but the prime minister was a Hutu who had been prominent in the political
                    party's formation. He had led one of the political parties and we knew him very
                    well. He was named in the peace accord to be the prime minister and now he was
                    the prime minister in this RPF-led government. Both the president and the prime
                    minister were Hutus. My job was to convince them to allow the French to continue
                    Operation Turquoise until things stabilized. The French were supposed to leave.
                    Of course, I failed in my mission because the RPF totally rejected the idea that
                    the French continue to stay in part of the country and protect these
                    genocidaires from their just desserts. But I did find some people that I knew,
                    including a journalist. I was trying to find a way to contact the prime minister
                    to have a meeting with him and of course the telephones didn't work. You had to
                    drive around and try to find people. I had no secretary, so if I left the
                    embassy there was nobody there to keep track of messages that were coming in for
                    meetings with us and so forth. It was very complicated. We were playing with the
                    radio and finding the government frequency because they were using radios, too.
                    They didn't have telephones. Lo and behold, one of my friends comes on the radio
                    and it turns out he had been named chief of staff for the prime minister. So, I
                    was able to get a meeting with the prime minister. Everybody whom I knew had to
                    tell their story and it was so difficult because of course you wanted to listen
                    and you had to listen, but it was so depressing. It was just miraculous how some
                    people had survived. Of course, I'm talking to both Hutus and Tutsis who had
                    come back or who had stayed. It was a very difficult time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to establish a presence then? Were any
                        Americans or others? Did any of our FSNs survive?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>LEADER: A large number of our FSNs did and some were coming back to the embassy.
                    Gradually the word was getting out that the embassy had started up again. Every
                    day, more people were trickling in. I don't have numbers. Our GSO came back. He
                    had been going around to all the houses and getting a team of FSNs to pack up
                    what was left by those who evacuated. Most of the houses were totally ransacked.
                    But he was able to salvage some things and get things ready for shipment. Then
                    we had also an acting admin officer who was there. She was a gem, too. She just
                    got right in there and was working with the FSNs trying to get things organized
                    again. Of course, we were eating MREs. A satellite phone was our only way to
                    communicate out of the country. The military had set up a van in embassy
                    backyard to give us some communications. We were trying to get cable traffic
                    going again. And we had this satellite phone which I did not know how to work.
                    The military advisor to the AF bureau had gone out with Ambassador Rawson and he
                    stayed, fortunately for me, because he knew how to operate the satellite phone.
                    We tried to set it up in my house and it wouldn't work except in the middle of
                    my yard, so that didn't help at night. I couldn't keep it next to me. I had a
                    big wall and so it wouldn't work unless it was sitting in the middle of my yard.
                    I think satellite communications have improved since then. It was a challenging
                    and interesting time. There were a few journalists roaming around trying to get
                    the story. I spent a lot of time talking to them about the background of the
                    situation. We got through it. In fact, the last day that I was there, a
                    presidential delegation arrived about 12 people strong for a day of meetings
                    with the various new leaders. This included people from the State Department.
                    The Central Africa Bureau director was on the plane. There were people from
                    non-governmental organizations. There were congressmen. There were congressional
                    staffers. There was a whole array of people. Of course, part of my job was to
                    set up all their meetings. The ambassador came back on that plane. A big problem
                    was what was I was going to feed them for lunch? The military came to my rescue.
                    They had large traynot just individual MREs but large trays of MREs. The
                    visitors all came to my house and I put out these MREs to feed them because I
                    had nothing else. I had two people working in my house. All they had to do was
                    heat up these things in the oven which was no problem. We used paper plates and
                    so forth. Then I left on the military plane that they had come in on. Actually,
                    I have to take that back. They came in on a C5, which is the biggest cargo plane
                    that the American fleet has. And guess what? At the same time that they came in,
                    the Russian equivalent of the C5 was also sitting there on the runway. So, I
                    think that was probably the first time in history that the American and the
                    Russian C5 equivalent were there. But we all did not go out in a C5. We went out
                    in a C130 or a C141. I guess we went down to Burundi and the visitors did some
                    stuff down there. Then we flew back to Frankfurt and then on to the States. I
                    think I went all the way back to Andrews Air Force Base with them, taking as
                    much of my own stuff as I could. I had my own stuff packed up. My stuff was not
                    ransacked except by my gardener, who was selling it out the back door, I thinall
                    my leather goods, my leather jacket, my leather briefcase, my leather backpack,
                    all my tee shirts, all my socks, some of my shoes, and some of my clothes were
                    missing. But my papers were all in order. Most of my clothes were still there.
                    So I was one of the lucky ones.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LEADER: I went on to AF/W, where I was the deputy director.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: 1994 in the summer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you did this until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: 1997 in the summer. I was asked to stay for the third year because there
                    was such a big turnover and I was the continuity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: AF/W consisted of what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: AF/W is concerned with 16 countries in West Africa, most of them
                    Francophone, but the most important ones are Anglophone. During that period of
                    time, our focus was primarily on Anglophone Nigeria, which was supposed to be
                    moving toward multiparty government and elections but wasn't going in the right
                    direction. We were looking always at the issue of sanctions, whether or not to
                    impose sanctions to try and force it to democratize and to get out of military
                    rule. The other big issue was Liberia. A civil war had started in 1989 and was
                    continuing. We were always trying to get some sort of a peace process going
                    there. While I was on the job, Sierra Leone was drawn into the Liberia conflict.
                    The conflict spread to Sierra Leone. Those were our biggest headaches. My
                    director, the AF/W director, was appointed as the President's special envoy for
                    Liberia, which meant that he was on the road most of the time. When he was in
                    Washington, he was focused pretty much exclusively on Liberia so I was left
                    managing all of these issues across the board with these states and working very
                    closely with the NSC, with our front office and our Deputy Assistant Secretary.
                    It was a fascinating job. We had a wonderful staff, a very talented group of
                    young people. We did a lot of good work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about Nigeria. What was the situation in
                        Nigeria? What were we doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: We were trying to talk to them about sanctions. Babangida was still in
                    charge as the president. He had taken over in a coup in 1983 just before I went
                    to Nigeria. He had left. There had been a transition to Shonekan, who had also
                    taken over in a coup. The elections didn't go the way everybody wanted and so
                    they arrested the person who ostensibly had won, Abiola. Then they had named a
                    businessman as a transitional president but Sani Abacha had stepped in and taken
                    over in a coup and was running a fairly brutal regime.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>One of the things that focused world attention on Nigeria at that time was the
                    hanging of an activist author, Ken Saro-Wiwa. He was from the southern delta
                    part of the country, an area where the oil companies were big. There was a lot
                    of grassroots opposition to the activities of the oil companies and to the
                    government relationship with the oil companies because of two things. One, they
                    were causing environmental damage which was affecting the livelihoods of the
                    people therfishing and farming. Two, money was a big problem. Of course, most of
                    it was going to the oil companies, but they were paying taxes to the central
                    government and the people didn't see those taxes coming back to their region for
                    any kind of development. It was going to other parts of the country. Saro-Wiwa
                    was arrested for what many thought was a trumped up charge of killing some
                    chiefs who were pro-government. He was tried and there was no appeal. He was
                    immediately hanged. This caused a great outcry around the world. So we were
                    launched on an effort to impose sanctions for this kind of human rights abuse
                    and to try to push the government into some more humane way of acting and
                    towards a return to the rule of law and a democratic process. This involved
                    working with our French and British colleagues. I remember going with the Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary and somebody from the NSC to London to meet with them about
                    trying to coordinate our activities. But one of the biggest problems was that
                    our own government was split on the issue of sanctions. The Congressional Black
                    Caucus was very much in favor of sanctions. Businesspeople and particularly the
                    Economics Bureau (EB) of the State Department were opposed to any kind of
                    sanctions on the government. AID was trying unilaterally to close down its
                    offices and the State Department fought to keep AID going because we thought
                    that AID needed to continue. So it was very difficult for us to get any kind of
                    agreement within the U.S. government. The desk officers would write a paper and
                    it would be circulated for clearance. We had to practically compromise away
                    whatever effort we were trying to make. There was always talk during this time
                    of having some sort of a special envoy for Nigeria. For a time, we did have
                    former Ambassador Donald McHenry. I just saw him a couple weeks ago. And Jesse
                    Jackson also wanted this job. I had the opportunity to travel to Nigeria with
                    him on a little tiny jet, me and one person from the NSC and Jesse Jackson. He
                    had a number of motives for wanting to get involved, one of which was to
                    strengthen the black constituency in the U.S. for Africa. Later, after I was out
                    of the picture in West Africa, he did get appointed as our special envoy for
                    democracy and got involved in some of the Liberia stuff. So that was basically
                    the picture. We were working with the special envoy. We were trying to move this
                    thing forward and working very hard and spinning lots of wheels on Nigeria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By this time, Susan Rice was the Assistant Secretary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: No, she was at the NSC. She had moved over from the peacekeeping office
                    to the Africa office and became the Africa director at the NSC.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you work with the NSC? What wavelength were they
                        on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>LEADER: NSC was pushing hard for sanctions and was not willing to really see that
                    there was opposition to sanctions, they weren't going to work very well, and
                    they might not be the best policy to pursue. But that was their policy and
                    that's what they were pushing on us. Ambassador Moose, our Assistant Secretary,
                    was going along with that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sanctions have had a mixed reaction. Part of it is,
                        sanctions seem to be, don't just stand there; do somethinbut not being very
                        effective. Were we getting any support from our European side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: We were working with the British trying to make a common cause. In fact,
                    we had quadripartite meetings. I think it was us, the British, the French, and
                    the Germans, and we were trying to get common agreement among them that they
                    could then take into the European Commission and try to get support. In fact,
                    the European Commission was much more proactive towards sanctions. I think they
                    imposed some kinds of sanctions while we had a great deal of difficulty coming
                    to any kind of common agreement in our government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obasanjo was the president. What was our reading on
                        him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: Obasanjo was the one military person who had been a ruler in Nigeria who
                    turned over power to the civilians. He turned over the government to elected
                    civilian leaders in 1979. The government didn't last long and it went back to
                    military rule and coup d'etats. But he was an elder statesman. He was working at
                    the time in a number of international organizations that were aimed at
                    democratization and peace. He was playing a significant role. He had a very good
                    reputation for his work in these areas. And so he was very well thought of
                    pretty much worldwide but certainly among African leaders. I think there was at
                    some time even talk about him running for Secretary General of the United
                    Nations when Boutros Ghali got it. But he was very well respected.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Ghana a problem at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>LEADER: Ghana was one of the success stories of this time. Jerry Rawlings was
                    still in charge. He had taken over in a coup. But he was moving toward
                    elections. He got elected. He was opening up his economy. Trade was flourishing.
                    Representative government was getting underway. There was a very favorable
                    impression of what was happening in Ghana. I have to say that Jerry Rawlings
                    personally had not lost his flamboyance and I think that despite some of the
                    advances that his country was making, he himself had not necessarily bought into
                    all of the changes that were happening under his tutelage. He continued to
                    justify his military coup. I say that because he came to the U.S. on a state
                    visit and gave a number of speeches around town. This was a theme of almost all
                    of them, his justification of his coup d'etats and coup d'etats in general. I
                    can't remember exactly what his whole argument was but it was a little bit
                    rooted in outdated ideas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get much involved in Liberia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: Liberia was in the hands of our special envoy, Dane Smith, who had been
                    ambassador to Guinea and had served in Liberia, so he knew the country well. For
                    the first two years that I was there, Dane was our envoy. The desk officer was
                    still in our office, so I worked very closely with the desk officer in
                    backstopping Dane's activities and moving papers through the government. One of
                    our biggest accomplishments was trying to get support for the West African
                    peacekeeping force. As I said regarding Rwanda, there wasn't much support in the
                    U.S. government for getting Americans involved in peacekeeping. The strategy
                    that was adopted was to build up African entities and capacity for providing
                    peacekeeping in situations where conflict needed that kind of intervention. In
                    the case of Liberia, the regional economic organization was one of the only
                    Anglophone and Francophone organizations in the region, called ECOWAS (Economic
                    Community of West African States). It had been formed for economic reasons but
                    now was turning to political and military action in Liberia. It stepped in. It
                    brought in troops from various countries including Senegal, Guinea, Mali, maybe
                    Togo. Nigeria was the major country that contributed troops. Most of the troops
                    that ECOWAS had were Nigerian. So, we were trying to help support this
                    peacekeeping operation under the auspices of ECOWAS. We were finally able to get
                    money, about 30 million dollars. The big problem was that the White House
                    announced that this money would be given. Of course the White House doesn't have
                    any money to give, so then we had to work all the papers to try and back up that
                    announcement. There was tremendous opposition within the State Department toward
                    kowtowing to the White House and giving this kind of money to this little
                    conflict in West Africa. So, it was very hard for us to overcome all the
                    obstacles that were being thrown in our way in getting the papers through the
                    White House.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any specific parts of the State Department that
                        were particularly difficult on this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>LEADER: If I recall correctly, the Policy Office was one of them and it was
                    influencing the lawyers who had to review the papers that our office was
                    writing. The lawyers were finding one problem after another, slowly changing
                    this word and that word and then changing them back again even aw we were up
                    against a deadline.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sort of the classic opposition to a policy within a
                        bureaucracy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: Absolutely. It was a classic case of the bureaucracy just slowing down
                    and almost preventing a policy from being implemented. We also dealt with the
                    Hill on this issue, had to go there several times to brief on Liberia and what
                    was going on. It was a very time consuming effort.</p>
                <p>The last year I was there, the new special envoy took the desk officer out of the
                    office. They became their own little office and worked independently of West
                    Africa, which was in a way a problem and a shame especially since the war was
                    spilling over to Sierra Leone, and there was a little bit of a disconnect
                    between the West Africa regional approach to the problem and what was going on.
                    A couple years later, it was brought back into the fold when he was named
                    director of the office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation when you started there in 1994 in
                        Liberia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: There was still a war going on. A lot of the country was under the
                    control of Charles Taylor who had launched his cross-border situation. There
                    were lots and lots of displaced people. Agriculture had practically stopped. The
                    schools weren't functioning. Hospitals weren't functioning. Food was in short
                    supply. It was a country that was totally breaking down. It was becoming totally
                    dysfunctional.</p>

                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>LEADER: Charles Taylor supported a homegrown Sierra Leone group called the RUF,
                    the Rebel United Front, something like that. They went in and were doing these
                    horrible things to villagers where they took over. They went in and captured or
                    were fighting for control of the diamond mines. So by the time I was involved,
                    there was a lot of the country that was off limits because of fighting and
                    insecurity. There were a number of NGOs trying to work there but from time to
                    time they'd have their people kidnapped and held by the rebels. These kinds of
                    things were going on. I visited the country during my tenure. While the war was
                    going on, there was an election. It was a democratic election and I happened to
                    be there just at the time that the election was having its round two and I went
                    to some of the polling places and so forth and it was quite orderly. The capital
                    was still functioning. Later, this also broke down and it also became a bit of a
                    failed state. But unlike Liberia, there continued to be leadership. The
                    government stayed intact in Sierra Leone. For a while, there was a coup of the
                    person who was elected. He fled to Guinea and then he came back and continued
                    on. So for a while, when I was there, the capital was in fairly good condition.
                    But it was all surrounded. You couldn't go outside the capital. It was even
                    somewhat dangerous to go to the airport because you had to go on a ferry and go
                    across the water. We did that, but it didn't seem that dangerous at the time.
                    But then about a year after my visit, the rebel forces pressed in on the capital
                    and we went through an evacuation.</p>

                        were Deputy Director of West Africa. We'll talk about the evacuation of

                <p>Today is December 2, 2003. Shall we do Freetown or Monrovia?</p>
                <p>LEADER: I think the first would have been Liberia. The war had heated up. Efforts
                    at peace talks and so forth weren't getting anywhere. Fighting was all around
                    the embassy compound. They sent in one of those ARGs, amphibious response
                    groups. There were about 2,000 Marines on the ship. Some of them came in to
                    guard the compound. So while there was a drawdown, a lot of people stayed during
                    that period of time. I recall that there was a logistics base in Sierra Leone in
                    Freetown that was operated by a company called PAE.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Engineers. They were big in Vietnam.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>LEADER: Right. They were providing logistical support for the ECOWAS troops who
                    were on the ground. I guess that was the way we were getting people in and out.
                    Or they could be ferried to and from the ships. There were some helicopters that
                    were going. I'm not sure we evacuated all the people at that time, but there was
                    fighting at the compound and shots were fired. The Marines who were guarding the
                    compound had to fire their guns on occasion. There were Liberians who had come
                    into the compound for humanitarian assistance who had been pushed out of their
                    homes. But we were focused on trying to protect the people who were there and
                    trying to work with both the government and with Taylor to try and calm things
                    down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were the deputy director there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: It was July '94 to July '97. I can't remember at that period of time if
                    we actually pulled everyone out. We may have.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we ever feel, why not get the hell out of Liberia and
                        not go back for a significant period of time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: I don't think we really took as much responsibility for the situation as
                    the Liberians would have liked. They always looked to us as their “colonial”
                    power since it was people from America who had gone back and started modern day
                    Liberia. I don't think that we wanted to cut and run. But our strategy was not
                    to be the main providers of troops or security forces. It was to support the
                    Africans in providing these services. So that was the strategy. PAE was paid by
                    the U.S. government as a support service for the African troops who were there.
                    I can't remember that we ever really discussed the possibility of pulling out
                    altogether. We were driven by security concerns. The policy was not to cut and
                    run.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any problem of concern about keeping people
                        there in harm's way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: I think the idea was that we would try to impress upon the warring
                    factions the need for security if they wanted us to stay. They would have to not
                    shell our compound, not fight in that area, try to keep things calm, allow the
                    hospitals to continue functioning, and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there just one incident about putting troops in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: I think that was the main one at that time. The director of our office
                    was the special envoy and he was trying to put together a coalition of support
                    for the peace process involving the French and the British and other European
                    powers who were interested. He was also trying to keep it in front of Congress
                    by giving staffers periodic updates as to what was going on.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about in Sierra Leone? It got nasty while you were
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: Sierra Leone got very nasty.</p>
                <p>One final thing about Liberia. Just before I left that job Liberia did go through
                    an election and Charles Taylor was elected. By now he has already been driven
                    out of office. But he was elected in June 1997.</p>
                <p>In Sierra Leone, a civil war was going on and it was pressing toward the capital.
                    But the democratization process was continuing at the same time. In 1996, there
                    was an election. There was a lot of criticism about holding an election because
                    a lot of the people in the conflict areas would not be able to participate, so
                    it was a very small part of the population that was able to cast ballots. But
                    the government did a pretty good job of getting ballots to cities, some of which
                    were besieged, and getting people to vote. So, President Kabbah was elected.
                    This was toward the end of my tenure there, in May 1997. All this time, Charles
                    Taylor was supporting the rebels in Sierra Leone and they had gained control of
                    the diamond mines and kept pressing towards the capital. At one point the
                    fighting came to the capital and the situation deteriorated very quickly. Our
                    ambassador was out of the country. The DCM was charg�.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: Ann Wright.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've interviewed her.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>LEADER: She was the person who was running the evacuation. It was a very
                    harrowing evacuation and they were using an ARG, one of those amphibious ships
                    off the coast. I remember which one it was. It was the Kearsarge. They gave me a
                    tee shirt that says, “The Kearsarge.” The big question was, how do we get our
                    people from Freetown to the ship and how can we protect them in the process?
                    There was firing around town. Some of the western installations were being
                    attacked. The decision was made to get them to a hotel which was on the beach
                    and then to bring in helicopters and take them out to the ship. They got to the
                    hotel and then the hotel was under siege. It was on fire. Our people who were at
                    the hotel left and were walking out on the beach. The Marines came in and made a
                    successful evacuation of them. Apparently there was a little bit of a delay in
                    getting the Marines there, which I later understood was because they were
                    practicing some kind of rescue mission. They managed to do it very successfully
                    and got everybody to the Kearsarge. The Kearsarge then went to Guinea. We had
                    some people come down from our embassy in Senegal to help because the embassy in
                    Guinea did not have a very big staff. They needed a little reinforcement to
                    process all these people who were coming out. So we brought some people down
                    from the embassy in Dakar. The skeleton staff of embassy people from Freetown
                    stayed in Guinea. They used a hotel for their base of operations. The embassy in
                    guinea is very small and was very stuffed with people. So, they used a hotel.
                    The new ambassador came out and he was operating for a good six months out of
                    Guinea up until at least December of1997 until they could get back into
                    Freetown. The evacuation was a pretty big operation and it was a pretty
                    harrowing one. Ann was a hero through the whole thing. She hardly got any sleep
                    at all. How she managed to function, I'll never know. It was a very harrowing
                    escape from a quickly deteriorating situation.</p>

                <p>LEADER: I got a little bit of a reprieve. I was assigned consul general in

                    an ambassadorship immediately after being promoted to OC. I did not stay the
                    whole three years, unfortunately, because it was gorgeous.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the main things that you found yourself doing in
                        Marseilles?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: Marseilles had a lot of representation activity. It is on the southern
                    coast of France where the United States had had such an impact during World War
                    II in terms of saving the people from the axis powers when we invaded and
                    liberated the coast. There is just ceremony after ceremony after ceremony
                    commemorating this. The mayors of Nice and Cannes were very strong in terms of
                    having these kinds of ceremonies and inviting the U.S. consul general, making
                    sure that you're there at this or that flag ceremony. On the Fourth of July,
                    there were about 10 stops to make for little ceremonies. That was a big time,
                    but there were other times that these ceremonies would take place. Frequently,
                    they were in connection with ship visits. The Sixth Fleet had its headquarters
                    in Naples, Italy, but the fleet would circulate in the Mediterranean and stop at
                    the French ports. These were always big events. The town would usually host a
                    big something or another. In Cannes, they did lovely luncheons for the officers
                    and some of the crew. We would often hold receptions and invite not only the
                    American community but also the French community onto the ship and so I'd have
                    to be on hand for that. Then there would be return receptions. There was a lot
                    of activity. This did dwindle a little bit because the ships were being called
                    more frequently to go through the Suez Canal to support the Sixth Fleet in
                    activities off Iraq. That did slow down our ship visits just a little bit.
                    Thanksgiving was another busy time.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>Also, there were American communities. There were a lot of Americans who stayed
                    in France after the war, married French women, raised their families there, and
                    were getting on in years. There were clubs of Americans who would get together.
                    One big one drew from most of Nice, Cannes, some from Monaco (to which I was
                    also accredited as the U.S. representative). So we would have events that they
                    would host as well. On the Fourth of July, there was always the problem of how
                    many of the dances could I get to, how many of these soirees. And at
                    Thanksgiving time, it was how many Thanksgiving dinners could I get to. There
                    were two clubs in Monaco. One time, I actually went to both dinners there. Then
                    you'd move down to Nice and Cannes. Then in Marseilles there were two or three
                    clubs that did dinners. It was incredible. Everybody at the consulate got
                    involved in representing us at these various dinners. Let me tell you, there are
                    more ways to serve pumpkin than I ever imagined. Nobody knew how to make a
                    pumpkin pie, but they knew how to make everything else out of pumpkin from
                    pumpkin soup to some other kind of dessert that was pumpkin. They all tried to
                    be very American and follow the ritual, but they all missed a little bit. But
                    nevertheless, we had to eat, to do our duty. That took up a lot of time,
                    especially traveling back and forth. There used to be a consulate in Nice as
                    well as in Marseilles. It was Nice that handled Monaco. But that had been closed
                    and all of those responsibilities shifted to Marseilles. When Bordeaux closed,
                    we also got half of that territory. So, our territory extended from the Italian
                    border and the principality of Monaco all the way to Toulouse. It was four hours
                    from Marseilles to Toulouse and it was three hours from Marseilles to the
                    principality of Monaco. So we were on the road quite a bit. We also went up to
                    Grenoble. That was part of the territory as well. I only got there a couple of
                    times. Then in addition, I dealt with American businesses in the area. We were
                    always looking at what they were doing. But it was interesting that they didn't
                    want a chamber of commerce. They had disbanded their chapter of the
                    French-American Chamber of Commerce and did not want to restart it. They didn't
                    see any value added. They all seemed to be getting along quite well without very
                    much support from us, though they tolerated our visits and our imposition on
                    them. A few times I traveled with the commercial officer from the embassy who
                    came down to see what was going on. There were some high tech industries down
                    there. There were some technological parks where there were a fair
                    representation of American businesses. So, that was another aspect. Airbus was
                    in our territory. So we had a lot to do with Airbus in Toulouse. Then there were
                    some other airplane plants near Marseilles that we went to from time to time. We
                    were trying to promote American business, but they didn't need too much
                    promotion. There were frequently American delegations that came to look at
                    business prospects. Sometimes we would hear about them and sometimes we
                    wouldn't. I might hear after the fact, “Oh, we had a delegation of Americans in
                    Marseilles.” I would hear it from somebody at the mayor's office. Well, they
                    hadn't bothered to tell us about it and we didn't really get involved. So it was
                    kind of catch as catch can. That was another aspect. I also tried to promote the
                    dissemination of information about American policy through collaboration with
                    our local USIS officer. We would do this by organizing speeches at some of the
                    universities in the area or with chambers of commerce or with other kinds of
                    clubs in the area. One of the ones that I liked to work with quite a lot was the
                    military. There was a military training school in the area. I organized a couple
                    of speeches there. Usually I tried to bring down people from our Paris embassy
                    who were more on top of the policies that we were promoting than we were in the
                    consulate. I only had three Americans at the consulate and one person who did
                    the navy criminal investigations. So that was another very important activity
                    that we were doing in the area to promote dissemination of policy.</p>

                        of the community?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: Quite honestly, they loved us. I don't know what's going to happen when
                    these people who remember the war are all dead. I'm sure it will change and I'm
                    sure that it has changed more recently. There was a little bit more ambivalence
                    about the U.S. in Marseilles itself because we bombed Marseilles and they
                    remembered that. We bombed it in the process of liberating it and they weren't
                    very happy about that approach. So, we weren't as warmly welcomed in Marseilles
                    at all these commemorations as we were farther up the coast on the Riviera.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the increasing number of North Africans into
                        France, many Muslim? Was this changing the character?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: Some people often refer to Marseilles as one of the largest Muslim cities
                    outside of Africa. In fact, in many parts of the world, they don't have as many
                    North Africans and Muslims. It had an impact in Marseilles particularly because
                    there was such a large North African community and there were a lot of people...
                    There were several different groups that had connections with Algeria and there
                    were the Pied Noir, the French who had lived and farmed and had their businesses
                    in Algeria who left when that revolution took place around 1960. A lot of them
                    settled in Aix-en-Provence, but also in other parts of southern France. Then
                    there were the Arabs who had worked for them who had fled when they did. And
                    there was just a lot of immigration from North Africa as well. There were parts
                    of the city that were really just Arab. In fact, it was quite fun right near the
                    consulate, right near the old port. There was a market that made you think you
                    were in North Africa because they had all the dates and the fruits and
                    vegetables that came from the orchards and the farms in that part of the world.
                    You really felt like you were in another place rather than France. Certainly a
                    lot of French people did not like coming to Marseilles. At the time I was there,
                    it was considered off bounds. People didn't think it was safe. It still had the
                    aura of being connected to the mafia and drug mafias. Then to have all of these
                    Arabs there. It's kind of like here in the metropolitan Washington area, some
                    people don't want to come into downtown Washington because they are not
                    comfortable there. Fortunately, it's my understanding that this has changed a
                    lot in Marseilles. It has really changed since I was there and become a much
                    more open city. Part of it is because of some commercial developments for which
                    I have to give the mayor and his people credit. They worked hard and they
                    succeeded where I didn't think they were going to. They have cruise ships going
                    into Marseilles regularly now. So part of it was their efforts to get the cruise
                    ships there, but it was also the fact that the fast train from Paris, the TGV,
                    now goes all the way to Marseilles. That has also made it easier for French
                    people to get there. It's helped it to become a tourist destination and to open
                    the city up more to everybody.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you looking at drugs in Marseilles?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: We did meet on occasion with some of the French investigators, but as far
                    as U.S. interest was concerned, we had closed our DEA offices in Provence and
                    the Riviera. The explanation for it that I was given was that drugs were still
                    coming into Marseilles but they were not going to the U.S. from there, they were
                    destined for other parts of Europe. So, our drug investigators were not so
                    consumed anymore with that trafficking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the old French Connection.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: Right. So our drug people were not so interested in that anymore.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever run across or deal with Le Pen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: We watched very closely what was going on with that political party, the
                    Front National, the FN. But it was U.S. policy that we not deal with them. This
                    became a big issue when a Front National party member was elected mayor of the
                    town which was a big port for some of our ships, Toulon. This became a big issue
                    when we would bring our ships into that port. It was a headquarters for the
                    French navy and so we would sometimes want to do exercises with them and maybe
                    bring in a ship. There was a Sixth Fleet liaison officer based in Toulon. He was
                    superb and is now the military attach� in the embassy in Madrid. He knew all the
                    people and all the players and all the characters. He was able to give us good
                    advice. They managed one time to bring the admiral who was the head of the Sixth
                    Fleet onto a ship there without having him make the traditional courtesy call on
                    the mayor. Some of the lower down officers did that. But we had to treat it not
                    as a party issue but as a protocol issue. So we did have lower officers from the
                    military meet them. But it made it very awkward for us. The whole idea that we
                    were supposed to report on these people without ever being able to talk to them
                    or any of their followers made it a little difficult.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>I would like to add one more thing that did become a very important issue for us
                    and that was security. One of the walls of our consulate was right down on the
                    street and so we weren't in a good situation. Security was becoming a big issue
                    after the explosions in East Africa. We worked with the mayor to get some
                    barriers put up behind our embassy so that people couldn't park there. It was a
                    very narrow street but cars had a tendency to pull up on the sidewalk and sort
                    of park temporarily. So we got that so they couldn't do that. We started to look
                    at our evacuation plan and how we would get out of our building. Our evacuation
                    plan was outdated because the building next to us which was supposed to be our
                    evacuation route had changed its roof and you couldn't get from one building to
                    the other anymore. We worked with police in Nice and Cannes and Toulouse about
                    security. So that was a big, important issue for us. We were always told that we
                    probably didn't need to worry about any links between the Islam in Marseilles
                    and the Islam of the Middle East, that these were very separate... Or the
                    Al-Qaeda. That these were very separate groups, very separate issues. The
                    rationale we were given was that nothing would happen in Marseilles because
                    there were some Algerian activists who used it as a planning base and they
                    didn't want to foul their own nest or to be chased out, or to bring the police
                    down on them. I always was a little skeptical of these assurances. As we've seen
                    more recently, there have been threats to the consulate in Marseilles that were
                    made public. That was another big issue that we were trying to deal with. There
                    were often big demonstrations in Marseilles. One time a consulate was occupied
                    by some demonstrators. This was always a concern, whether the demonstrations
                    would remain peaceful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were they demonstrating about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: Well, there would be political demonstrations. I'm trying to remember
                    what that particular one was about. Turkish Kurds often demonstrated. I think it
                    was the Turkish consulate that got occupied. Usually they were very calm and
                    they were very peaceful in their marches. They were usually allowed to march. It
                    was the Turkish Kurds who were protesting the treatment of a Turkish Kurd who
                    had been arrested by the government of Turkey and imprisoned and was going on
                    trial. That was one of the big ones.</p>

                <p>LEADER: I went in September 1999 and was just beginning to really get my feet on
                    the ground when I had the unfortunate experience of fainting at a reception and
                    that was pretty much all she wrote. The medical people got me out of there and
                    never allowed me to go back except to pack out.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LEADER: Yes, it was a very, very upsetting experience.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the medical thing turn out? Was this a long-term
                        problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: Well, they evacuated me because they suspected some problem with my
                    heart. I evacuated to Paris and they gave me test after test after test and they
                    didn't find anything. Then they brought me back to Washington and they did test
                    after test after test and didn't find anything. Then one doctor did some test
                    where he found out that I had a tendency to low blood pressure. The analysis
                    then was that I probably fainted because I was dehydrated. I've not fainted
                    since. It's been three and a half years now.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LEADER: It was a day when I was sick. It was a holiday and I wasn't feeling well
                    that day. But I decided to go to the Dutch national day reception at somebody's
                    house. I was just drinking tonic. I wasn't drinking anything. But I probably
                    hadn't had enough water that day and I was a little bit ill. That's what
                    happened. Two doctors who were there, two Dutch folks, claimed that I stopped
                    breathing, which is what scared them a lot. But the doctors here don't believe
                    that that happened. They believed that my blood pressure dropped so low that it
                    seemed like I wasn't breathing. What am I to say? I don't know.</p>

                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: Our principal interest in Guinea at the time was regional security. We
                    had had the war in Liberia and the war in Sierra Leone and we were trying to
                    come out of both of those situations. The only way to get into Sierra Leone was
                    to come to Guinea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is the capital?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: Conakry. To get to Sierra Leone you come to Conakry, and then flew in a
                    helicopter that was run by the UN for about a half an hour. I never got to do it
                    myself. Most of our visitors came for that purpose. Our visitors included three
                    weeks after I arrived Madeleine Albright, who was Secretary of State, and we had
                    congressmen come. Tony Hall, who was from Ohio, and his Virginia congressman
                    friend, Frank Wolf, came together. They were very interested in the humanitarian
                    situation and we got them out to see refugee camps. Regional stability was the
                    overlay of our concerns. We were particularly concerned about the refugee camps.
                    It also meant that we were working to develop a military to military
                    relationship with the Guinean military. This took the form primarily of
                    training. There were lots of training exercises that we did even in the short
                    time that I was there. The goal was to strengthen their capability to defend
                    themselves and keep instability from being a domino effect that would spill over
                    to Guinea. I'm not sure that we totally succeeded. I don't think that they're
                    out of the woods yet. Those were important issues. The other thing we were doing
                    was trying to promote democratization and political parties. There were several
                    opposition political parties and they were all fairly weak. Through USIA and AID
                    we were trying to support these political parties and help them strengthen their
                    ability to play a role, to have an impact. In this regard, they had just had a
                    presidential election but they were going to have some legislative elections. So
                    we were trying to work with the government to have an independent electoral
                    commission. In so many of these Francophone countries in particular it's the
                    Ministry of the Interior that usually manages elections through the elected
                    officials in the various parts of the country. So we were trying to do this. It
                    was a good example of collaboration with our allies because the diplomatic
                    community came together around this issue. We would try to coordinate our
                    interventions with the government and our support for this initiative. It didn't
                    get very far. The elections were held while I was out of the country. They were
                    won overwhelmingly by the president's party. I think there is probably some
                    evidence that a number of the elections may have been stolen. For example, there
                    was one precinct in Conakry itself where a key opposition figure voted and the
                    results showed no votes for his party in that precinct but he had voted for
                    himself. So there were a lot of little shenanigans going on there.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LEADER: AIDS was not high on the radar screen or the priorities of the
                    government. The prevalence rate in Guinea was very low, in the three to five
                    percent range, which was very low for Africa. In comparison, Rwanda was at
                    one-third, 33%. In Guinea there was a very low incidence. I think we had some
                    programs for information dissemination and condom distribution but at that time
                    it hadn't become a huge issue. And the government was still a bit in denial. I
                    think they still retain that position.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the role of the French there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: It was a very strange situation because the French had left so
                    precipitously after Guinea opted out of the French empire. They always say they
                    took everything. Certainly the French ambassador who came shortly after I got
                    there, he was very young and very energetic and very aggressive, and was
                    certainly not an apologist for the French position. He seemed to have a great
                    deal of access to the government and to the officials in the government and
                    possibly there were some military relationships there where they had maybe
                    military trainers in the Guinean army. I'm not sure about that. The French were
                    very visible and very present. They seemed to have a fair amount of clout with
                    the government and with the people. There was a connection there that had never
                    really been broken.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find you were received by the government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: I found the government people there rather difficult to get through to. I
                    felt that they would listen to what we had to say but there was nothing coming
                    back. There was no real dialogue. I personally attributed this to a kind of
                    hangover effect from the S�kou Tour� era when everybody had to be very wary of
                    what they said and to whom. I felt that there was still a cloud over the
                    politics and the interactions among people that was still a residue from the
                    very harsh and brutal regime of S�kou Tour� even though he had died in 1984. So
                    it was 15 years that Lansana Cont�, the then president and still president, and
                    about to run again president, has been in power. But he hasn't done a lot to
                    open up politics, economics or trade. All of those things are still very
                    closed.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>I did want to mention something about human rights. That's what I had on my mind
                    a few minutes ago. This was an issue that we were pushing, including the humane
                    treatment of a high profile detainee who was a leader of an opposition political
                    party. He had been detained and in jail for several years since the presidential
                    election and then was going on trial just shortly before I had to leave the
                    country. I had sat in on part of the trial. We were trying to ensure that he
                    would receive a fair and humane trial. He did get acquitted finally about six
                    months later. But it was probably a political decision as much as anything. They
                    had to figure out how to get out from under this issue, so that was how they
                    finally did it. Human rights were still not that good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came back in 2000, what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: It was the summer and most jobs had been assigned. So, I was a little bit
                    at sea. There didn't seem to be anything in the Africa Bureau for me to do. I
                    looked at several other jobs for which I was totally unqualified like economic
                    jobs, one even in Political-Military, a couple of things. I was willing to do
                    them and try my luck, but I didn't have much to bring to them. Fortunately, at
                    the last minute, other people came forward with more qualifications. So, I was a
                    bit at sea. I was talking with the people in the office that handles details
                    about whether they had any details to the Pentagon, to Commerce Department, to
                    anyplace else around town. Again, all these things had been filled already. In a
                    kind of offhand way, one of the people there said, “Sometimes people find their
                    own jobs outside.” I said, “What are you talking about?” They said, “Well, if
                    you can find yourself a position with an NGO, then we can ask to see whether you
                    can be assigned there and have the State Department continue to pay you.” So, I
                    said, “All right.” I went to three organizations. There was one that usually had
                    a State Department fellow, the Atlantic Council. All three of them were quite
                    anxious to have me. Of course, they'll take an extra body whose salary was being
                    paid.</p>
                <p>So, I opted to work with the Fund for Peace, which is a small NGO that has a
                    number of projects aimed at trying to ameliorate war and reduce violence. They
                    were going to give me an opportunity to write about Rwanda. They had an
                    analytical tool that they were very happy to apply to Rwanda and were anxious to
                    have me help use it. So that's what I did. I became a senior fellow at the Fund
                    for Peace and was there from October 1, 2000 until August 2001. I wrote a book
                    which they published.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the title of the book?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>LEADER: The book is called, Rwanda's Struggle for Democracy and Peace, 1991-1994.
                    It basically tells the story of what was happening inside the country in the
                    three years leading up to the genocide, which the people themselves were trying
                    to avert. They were trying to democratize and effect the peace accord. That was
                    the story I was trying to tell. I used the analytical tool to assess the Rwandan
                    situation and show that there were points along the way where we might have put
                    more emphasis on one thing or another or we might have tried to have
                    interventions that we didn't because we didn't have our eyes so much on that
                    aspect of the situation. So, it was an interesting exercise. I'm now trying to
                    revise this book and see if we can interest a commercial publisher. We'll take
                    what I've already written and do some rewriting, which it needs, and use that as
                    a core. But we'll also look at conflict resolution and the business of whether
                    genocide could happen again in Rwanda. My association with that non-governmental
                    organization has been very fruitful. I'm still working closely with them. My
                    Rwanda case study became the model they used to promote marketing this tool with
                    other governments and with our own government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find this analytical tool? So often, these
                        things come out of the political science department and they seem to be
                        something out of the never, never land. They don't have much pertinence to
                        the real world.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: The difference is that this particular analytical tool was created to be
                    used by practitioners. It wasn't created to be used simply by analysts. It was
                    created to try to direct the practitioners' attention to things that might
                    otherwise be overlooked. So, that is the difference. It has 12 indicators that
                    you look at and rate on a scale of one to ten at different points in time so you
                    can plot charts and so forth of where things were getting worse or getting
                    better. So, it was a fairly informative kind of analysis. I think it is
                    something that we as Foreign Service officers need to become more familiar with.
                    The word that we used a lot with Iraq was “stovepiped.” We have our political
                    section. We have an economic section. We have our military unit. We have our
                    consular section. They all come to country team meetings and so forth, but there
                    is not a lot of real cross-fertilization and interaction. The analytical tool
                    asks you to look at social, economic, and political indicators and tries to
                    bring them together a little bit. While it's something that you think of as
                    being more an INR kind of exercise, using it there means that you don't have the
                    practitioners. So it gives you a way of looking at things so that we could
                    benefit. Others could in the future.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After you finished this, what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>LEADER: Well, then I got assigned to be the director of the Office for Asia and
                    the Near East in the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, PRM. I went
                    over to start this job on August 20th and had a few days under my belt before we
                    had an orientation at FSI (Foreign Service Institute). No sooner had we finished
                    the orientation, that 9/11 happened. I think I got back in the office on Monday
                    and it happened on Tuesday. So, I did not have time to break myself into this
                    job. We were immediately immersed. I was scheduled to travel and my bosses
                    decided that I would still travel at the end of September. I went to the Middle
                    East, to Jordan for a conference that had to do with UNRWA, the United Nations
                    Relief and Works Agency, which manages, over sees, and provides social services
                    to the Palestinian refugees. I went to one of their annual meetings and did a
                    little bit of traveling in Jordan, Syria, and Israel before coming back.</p>
                <p>By the time I got back, my office was immersed in Afghanistan and the fact that
                    there were two million refugees outside the country already and more coming out.
                    The big issue was keeping the border open. We had our ambassador telling the
                    Pakistani government to close the border, but at the same time we're telling
                    Pakistan to keep it open so that those people who are vulnerable can get
                    through. That was our major issue initially. But it was also the fact that
                    winter was coming. Despite the fighting going on inside Afghanistan, NGOs and UN
                    organizations were seized with the need to get as much food in as possible so
                    that there would not be starvation during the long, cold winter when some parts
                    of the country would be cut off and people might not have the food resources
                    that they needed. There was a humongous effort that was led by the World Food
                    Programme. Eventually, they managed to get up to 100,000 metric tons a week. It
                    was a lot of food that they were getting in there. Of course, then our big issue
                    was, what to do about this bridge that was out of service between northern
                    Afghanistan and Tajikistan. It was a big issue, trying to get that bridge open
                    so that food could flow up to the north.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the problem? Who was opposing it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: Part of the problem was that even if we got trucks across the bridge, the
                    infrastructure was not available to move this food on to other places, which had
                    a lot to do with trying to get the railroad going and getting storage areas. It
                    was just a real big problem. I don't think Tajikistan was objecting to it, but
                    there were concerns because they did not want people fleeing across the bridge
                    into Tajikistan. If you open it one way, then you can go back the other way. I
                    can't remember all of the issues, but it went on for weeks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Pakistan? An awful lot of refugees ended
                        up in Pakistan.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>LEADER: Right. There were already two million in Pakistan and two million in Iran
                    when we got involved in trying to end the Taliban regime and catch Al-Qaeda. We
                    figured about 250,000 came across the closed border up until the end of the year
                    after 9/11. Some of them would filter into old settlements. Then there was a
                    group that got stuck at one of the borders and that became a long issue for us
                    as well. Pakistan said, “You can't come in” and they didn't want to go back.
                    They weren't getting fed. It was cold. There were some deaths among those
                    people. That situation was difficult for over a year and finally the people who
                    were stuck at the border, about 40,000, chose either to go into Pakistan to some
                    new camps or to go back into Afghanistan to a displaced persons camp that was
                    set up near Kandahar. It was about half and half that decided to go one way or
                    another. Eventually, that situation ended.</p>
                <p>Pakistan has been fairly cooperative. By March 2002, UNHCR started repatriation
                    of those who wished to go back to Afghanistan. By that time, Hamid Karzai was
                    already in place as interim president. There was a multinational force. The U.S.
                    force was still there. While the UN was not saying that the situation was secure
                    enough for refugee return, they were facilitating the return of those who chose
                    to do so. From March 1 through the end of the year, two million people went back
                    - 1.5 million from Pakistan and about .3 million from Iran. Then there were
                    others who went spontaneously without going through the UN procedures. That
                    provided some reintegration package, including some money for their transport,
                    food, and some tools if they were going to a rural area, and some shelter
                    materials if they were going to an urban area. Another big problem was that a
                    lot of them were going to Kabul and Kabul's infrastructure wasn't really
                    equipped to support that kind of an influx of people. UNHCR had made a deal that
                    they would take care of people in the hinterlands. UN Habitat was supposed to
                    take care of people in the city, but they had no experience with emergencies and
                    they didn't know what to do with all these people. There was a bit of a problem
                    there. But they got through the winter. They did real well at planning the next
                    winter. The government set up a task force that drew from all different
                    government agencies and they worked with non-governmental organizations to
                    stockpile food and winter supplies in some of the most remote areas so when the
                    roads were cut off by the snows, the goods would already be in place. This saved
                    a lot of lives last year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a problem as we had in Somalia where warlords

                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>LEADER: It didn't become a big issue for us. I'm sure that in some instances,
                    some of the food may have been diverted. But it wasn't a big issue that was at
                    the top of our priority list. UNHCR was not complaining about this. It was going
                    pretty well. Of course, they were trying to limit the amount of food after one
                    year that was being given away and trying to get it into food for work programs
                    or other things to try and build up the market again. There was a drought going
                    on at the same time, which is why so many UN organizations and NGOs were there
                    in the first place. The country was suffering a big drought and food was very
                    scarce. As different areas of the country came on stream again with production
                    of food, then they were trying to cut back on food donations.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LEADER: Well, all indications were that it was. I don't have information to
                    suggest otherwise. When internally displaced people ended up at camps near
                    Herat, the UN people started programs of food for work instead of just giving
                    them the rations. They didn't become so dependent on just handouts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you gearing up for Iraq?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: I should say this in connection to that question. Yes, there were
                    warlords in Afghanistan and yes, there were reports that they were having an
                    impact on the returnees. The kind of impact that they were having was that they
                    were recruiting them into their militias. Some of the people who would go to the
                    areas where the warlords were strong were being harassed and told that they had
                    to join militias. There were areas where certain ethnic groups were taking
                    advantage of the confusion and the chaos to harass people of a different ethnic
                    group to leave the area. They were forcing them out. This was particularly true
                    around Mazar-e-Sharif, where Dostum and another warlord were fighting a lot but
                    they were also mobilizing people against the Pashtun, the southerners, and they
                    were driving the Pashtun out. Those were the people who were coming down through
                    Afghanistan and then out from Kandahar into the Baluchistan area of Pakistan.
                    Those were the ones who didn't want to go back because they didn't have any
                    place to go back to because they were afraid of continual harassment. Assistant
                    Secretary Dewey did get involved in that one. He went out there and tried to
                    talk with these leaders about human rights violations. The UNHCR did initiate
                    the formation of a commission to look into these kinds of human rights
                    violations and to try to ameliorate the situation. So, those were the kinds of
                    difficulties that the warlords were creating for the returnees.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Iraq hovering? You were doing this until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: I had a team of about six people working on Afghanistan right after 9/11
                    through the summer of 2002. We had just gotten ourselves organized. We had named
                    a team captain. My deputy and I would be a little more distanced from their
                    day-to-day activities. They would be able to carry on with guidance and so
                    forth. Instead of coming to us with their papers, they would go to the team
                    leader. It was all set up by the end of August 2002. This functioned for about a
                    month until we were drawn into contingency planning for Iraq. Our Afghan team
                    leader was drawn into that activity. We had lost some of our other people. The
                    Afghan team was down to only a couple people. We had about three people still
                    working on Afghanistan all of last year while we were engaged with Iraq. But
                    Iraq drew people from not only my office but also other offices and we started
                    having several meetings weekly and eventually daily. I had a meeting every
                    morning. Our Assistant Secretary had two or three meetings a week. We were just
                    meetinged up the kazoo. We were working on the humanitarian implications of a
                    war. It was in this context that we were dealing with United Nations
                    organizations, particularly UNHCR and the International Committee of the Red
                    Cross. A lot of the information gathering about their preparations was being
                    done in Geneva where we have a refugee unit at the U.S. mission and where they
                    have the benefit of trusting relationships built up over a long period of time
                    with all these organizations. We did not have the same kind of access in New
                    York (NY) to the UN itself and to those organizations that are headquartered in
                    NY. Of course, we have our mission to the UN, but there is only one person to
                    handle the whole humanitarian situation and she got a little overwhelmed. We had
                    identified food as being a major issue in Iraq not only for people who might
                    become displaced but for the entire operation there. This was because of the Oil
                    for Food Programme that was put in place in the mid-'90s. This program allowed
                    Iraq to import food and other essential humanitarian supplies in exchange for
                    the export of oil. Sixty percent of the 26 million people were totally dependent
                    on the food coming in through this program which was distributed in the south by
                    the government and in the north through a ration system run by the UN
                    organizations, WFP in particular. But other UN organizations were also involved
                    in the north. They were building hospitals and housing and factories that were
                    converting food into products. So there was real concern on the part of those
                    who were looking at the humanitarian side of things about this particular issue.
                    We spent a lot of time trying to research it, work with other organizations,
                    find out what was going on. Finally, we had to talk to the people at the UN. I
                    led the initial delegation up there to try to talk to them, but they really
                    didn't want to talk to us. They were very worried about appearances. While the
                    UN Secretary General was involved in trying to get the parties to back off of
                    war, the UN agencies did not want to would appear to be preparing for war. So,
                    we had to deal with that. We finally had to say, “Look, you can't afford not to
                    do contingency planning.” We finally got them more or less focused on that. We
                    began to work with the people even in NY.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>Security was another issue, what was called “humanitarian mapping.” In the first
                    Gulf War, a lot of infrastructure like bridges and warehouses were destroyed. In
                    this war, that was not the case largely because we made it such an important
                    issue early on. In order to keep the humanitarian situation from becoming a
                    disaster, infrastructure should not be destroyed, which points to another big
                    area that we were involved with, and that was coordinating with the military.
                    Two people from my office were briefed at the highest levels about the military
                    plan. The rest of us didn't know it. They were on a humanitarian planning team,
                    an interagency group that had people from the State Department, including from
                    my office, from the Economic Bureau, maybe from PM, and then they had people
                    from the Pentagon, from AID. These people were working together to craft a
                    response plan. That plan was under the auspices of a planning group that was
                    being run out of the NSC. So the NSC group took this plan and they massaged it a
                    little bit. Then it was briefed to the President. The plan involved humanitarian
                    workers going in not far behind the military to do what they would have to do.
                    So this becomes another big issue. Who provides security for the civilians? So
                    we had to work on a memorandum of understanding with Defense, AID, and State,
                    and that was a very long, tedious effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think that particularly Defense was looking at
                        it... The Defense plan was really to try to go in with as few troops as
                        possible so you don't have a lot of war fighting capability. Defending
                        civilians gets kind of in the way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: We weren't expecting the military to be dealing with civilians except to
                    the extent that there might be displaced people in need who would be cut off or
                    who would have moved and would need some assistance that could not be provided
                    by civilians. We kept asking: what are your people prepared to do in terms of
                    providing assistance to displaced people? Basically the answer was, “We've got
                    it covered.” So we never did find out exactly what the plan was. But at the same
                    time we knew they were stockpiling HDRs [humanitarian daily rations]. We got
                    into the same issue that we did with Afghanistan and that was the color of the
                    packages. The color was very similar to an ordinance. And then they had their
                    civil affairs units who went in with them. Frankly, I never knew exactly what
                    the civil affairs units were expected to do or were able to do or did do. But we
                    also worked very hard with others in the State Department to ensure that the
                    civilian humanitarian workers associated with NGOs who would be funded by us or
                    maybe by others would have access as early as possible and as quickly as was
                    necessary. That was another big issue. Because of all the sanctions on Iraq and
                    Iran, there were a lot of limitations on what they could take in, who could go
                    in, how they could go in, what they could take in with them. In actual fact,
                    it's hard to know exactly what happened unless you were right out there. They
                    weren't supposed to take cell phones. They weren't supposed to take computers.
                    There were all kinds of restrictions on what products could be taken in and what
                    had to be notified to the UN and so forth. We worked very hard with the
                    Treasury, supporting EB basically to work with the Treasury and the Commerce
                    Department and the UN to ensure these organizations would not be hamstrung by
                    the regulations but would be able to offer some assistance.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It must have been very frustrating. The whole sanction
                        issue was a dead letter once we went in. This was a different ballgame.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: Right, and that's what the NGOs kept saying. “All of this jumping through
                    hoops isn't going to mean a thing because once we're needed, we're going to be
                    there regardless.” I think that's how it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what happened to you? Were you there at the beginning
                        of the war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEADER: Oh, yes. We were there at the beginning of the war. The fortuitous thing
                    was that number one, people didn't move. They stayed in place. Number two, in
                    anticipation of a conflict, the government had issued multiple rations, so
                    people had rations in their home for several months. I'm not sure we ever
                    determined exactly how long, but let's say up through the end of June. The
                    people who didn't sell them to get other products had those rations available.
                    So, the food catastrophe that we thought might be a possibility didn't happen
                    but our efforts on this issue weren't in vain because we had convinced WFP and
                    the Oil for Food Programme that they had to work together and be ready to stand
                    up the ration system again. Even though our long-term goal was to have a market
                    economy function, it was clear that you couldn't cut people off of these rations
                    precipitously. You had to do it gradually over time and you had to build up the
                    market and the financial resources of the people. Their salaries were very low
                    partly because their food rations were included. So, if you just take away the
                    food rations and not raise the salaries, then they're not going to have any
                    money to buy other food. It became a big post-conflict issue to define the
                    transition from the Oil for Food Programme to some interim activity that would
                    be run by the coalition government to eventually a market economy. A big date
                    just passed. November 21 was the day that the Oil for Food Programme transition
                    which had been going on for six months was finished and the UN organizations
                    were out of there. No more were they going to be dealing with food distribution,
                    building houses, or any of the other things that they were dealing with under
                    the Oil for Food Programme. That was fini. I'll have to go back and find out
                    what's happened because I'm still very worried that not all of the materials
                    that were supplied under the Oil for Food Programme have now been converted into
                    market economy goods. But we'll see.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you actually retire from this very hectic
                        work?</hi>

                        going?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>LEADER: Our bureau was very concerned that the U.S. was shutting out the UN
                    organizations. As a bureau that deals with refugees and humanitarian assistance,
                    we are by nature multilateralists because we have to work with and through these
                    organizations. So we were very concerned that these organizations were not
                    getting an audience, getting a hearing, they weren't being trusted, they weren't
                    able to function as they should. So, this was a major concern of ours. Another
                    issue of ours was that refugees were starting to return home spontaneously,
                    people in exile. There was a particular situation in Saudi Arabia where there
                    were 5,000 Iraqis at a camp who had been languishing there ever since the
                    earlier Gulf War and these people now wanted to go home. So, UNHCR was starting
                    to set up repatriation procedures and suddenly the coalition government said,
                    “No, they can't come back. It's not time. There's not enough security. There
                    won't be jobs for them.” That's when UNHCR sent a special representative out,
                    Dennis McNamara, who had been very active in Cambodia, Bosnia, and East Timor.
                    He was a very experienced person. He went out and tried to talk with them and
                    they made some compromises where a certain number of people would be able to
                    come back and it would all be very controlled. Part of the problem was, there
                    were no border controls. They were worried that if people were starting to come
                    back from Iran, that there might be Trojan horses, security risks involved. In
                    June 2002, the Refugee Bureau had people attached to DART [disaster assistance
                    response] teams that AID sets up. We had people attached to teams in the north
                    operating out of Mosul, in the east operating out of Amman and in the south
                    operating out of Kuwait. So we already had some of our people on the ground
                    dealing with what might happen on the refugee side. Some of those people moved
                    in to the country. Eventually, we had somebody come who was supposed to be in
                    Tbilisi but she was covering UN activity in Cyprus and then she went in to be a
                    liaison with the UN organizations for the coalition administration. Then in June
                    we sent out our person who had started off the year as our Afghan coordinator.
                    He was now our Baghdad person. He was there for three months. Now we have
                    another person there who is trying to help the coalition authority deal with
                    issues that concern particularly the refugee and displaced persons aspect of any
                    situation. We were very lucky that it did not escalate, did not become a huge
                    calamity or crisis. But there are still issues. People want to reclaim their
                    property. We are concerned about getting property commissions set up and so
                    forth. I think that the lack of multilateralism, the effort of the U.S.
                    government to hold on to all aspects of the management of this huge situation,
                    created a lot of dilemmas and a lot of misreading of some of the situations.
                    They didn't want to hear some of the analyses of other agencies and so forth.
                    The State Department was shut out more and more. We felt we had a good working
                    relationship with the Pentagon during the lead-up to the war, but once the war
                    started, that kind of deteriorated.</p>

                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>LEADER: Certainly you've listened to a lot of people tell their stories. The
                    image that the Congress has that Foreign Service officers are all out there at
                    tea parties in marble halls and in receptions is not the experience of most
                    Foreign Service officers. Given the circumstances of the world today, it's only
                    going to get more difficult rather than less.</p>
