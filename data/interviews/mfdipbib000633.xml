                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mr. Ambassador, how did you become interested in foreign
                        affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: I guess from childhood on up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: I was born in Princeton, New Jersey. My father was a professor. We were
                    interested in foreign relations from the very beginning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did your father teach?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Modern languages.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were already in the culture right from the
                        beginning?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: I remember in World War I when we got the morning paper, the New York
                    Times, and the family would say, “What did the English do? What did the
                    Americans do? What did the French do?” and so forth. It came down to my turn—I
                    was the youngest—and I said, “What happened to the Germans?” I suppose from that
                    moment on my interest was sparked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have to say that one of the positive sides of a
                        war—there aren't many positive sides—it certainly can bring out an interest
                        in foreign affairs in many people. I know I had the same thing with World
                        War II.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>You were born in 1911, and you were in the military for quite some time, weren't
                    you?</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>KOREN: I was in the military from the time I got an ROTC commission in 1933, and
                    then I was on active duty from 1940 to '46.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What type of work were you doing, sir?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: I commanded first a company and then a battalion in the Airborne.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did any of this spark continue to keep your interest in
                        foreign affairs outside of the military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: When we were in France, I tried to speak French. [Laughter] I found that
                    that was one of the things they didn't teach us, how to speak. I could write and
                    read and everything else, but speaking was not very easy to come by, so to
                    speak. The same thing happened in German. I had taken a lot of German, but I
                    have absolutely no fluency in German. When I took the Foreign Service oral exam,
                    the then—what do they call them—director of the . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Board of Examiners?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Board of Examiners. What was his name? He's very well known.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think we're both thinking of the same man, because I
                        think he was doing that for years. But anyway.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: It's ridiculous I can't think of it. He said, “Will you please open the
                    little book to page 17?” And I looked at page 17 and it was Greek. And so trying
                    to be humorous, I said, “Well, that's all Greek to me, sir,” and he didn't think
                    that was very funny at all. [Laughter] Joe Green, that's who it was, Joseph C.
                    Green. That started me off sort of on the wrong foot.</p>
                <p>Then another thing that happened was the day I took the oral exam was the day
                    that Gandhi had been murdered, and somebody asked me, “Who did it?”</p>
                <p>I said, “I didn't know, but I was sure that if a Moslem did it, it would be very
                    serious.”</p>
                <p>And he said, “Well, suppose it was Hindus that did it?”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Well, that would be serious enough but not quite as bad.”</p>
                <p>He said, “You seem to know something about the sects of religion in India.”</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>And I said, “No, I really don't know anything,” but he led me down the garden
                    path and the first thing I knew I was over my head, way over my head.</p>
                <p>So I came back that evening and said to my wife, “If you had any idea of going
                    into the Foreign Service, forget about it.” [Chuckles] I thought I'd go flatly
                    on my can. I was surprised when they told me I had passed. I was then working
                    for the Central Intelligence, CIA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is in 1948?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: '48, yes. They couldn't understand why I would be interested in other than
                    the Foreign Service. My brother was also in the Foreign Service, and he had
                    passed the exams. As a matter of fact, he should have been in the Foreign
                    Service from the word “go,” but in those days when he graduated from college,
                    the idea was that you had to have a little money to be in the Foreign Service.
                    The Rogers Act changed all that, fortunately, but it was too late for him to go
                    in. So he went in under the Manpower Act and I went in under the Manpower Act,
                    also. But he had already been accepted to the Foreign Service. It must have been
                    the spring of '48, or maybe even earlier. I don't remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came in at about what rank?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Class 4.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The old Class 4. They keep changing it, but Class 1 used
                        to be the top rank and there's career ambassador. Coming in as a mid-level
                        officer, did you get much training before you went out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: We had the Foreign Service school. I can't remember. That lasted the whole
                    winter of '47, '48, and we were sworn in I think it must have been June of '48,
                    and we were commissioned by Secretary Marshall at that time. I remember very
                    distinctly going up to Secretary Marshall, because he had a reputation of
                    remembering and I'd only met him a couple of times before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was when you were in the military?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>KOREN: In the military, and the last time was just before I went overseas he had
                    the practice of visiting every division before it went overseas and picking out
                    one to inspect very thoroughly, and it just happened that he picked my unit, my
                    battalion. The thing that I thought very interesting was when I went through the
                    line to receive my Foreign Service diploma, he said, “I've seen you someplace
                    before.”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Yes, sir,” and I told him.</p>
                <p>He said, “I thought so.” So that was the end of it but, of course, this gave
                    General Marshall a very high pinnacle in my book. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your first posting was to Port-au-Prince. What was the
                        situation in Haiti when you were there? This is 1948.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Well, it was still the vestige of occupation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Our occupation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Our occupation. We were very fortunate in that respect that the U.S. stood
                    pretty high, and the marine occupation had been a benevolent occupation, as you
                    know. They were still very highly regarded. As a matter of fact, most of what is
                    now known as infrastructure was due to the marine occupation. They had built the
                    roads and so forth and so on.</p>
                <p>Many of the Haitian businesses had prospered under the marine occupation. For
                    instance, car dealers did very well and others did well. It was really at that
                    time only one product that was even slightly important in the world scene, and
                    that was the sugar and sisal. There wasn't native Haitian sugar people, but
                    mostly it was run by the United States, by Americans, and they obviously were
                    prosperous.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you doing economic reporting mostly?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>KOREN: At the beginning I was assigned as the administrative officer, and it was
                    sort of a first drawback as far as the Foreign Service was concerned, and I was
                    concerned that the previous man who had been the so-called administrative
                    officer had been drummed out of the Service because he was a homosexual and
                    everybody knew it, so that didn't give me a very good taste. Our ambassador was
                    Jacques Decoursey. I don't know whether you ever knew him, but he had been the
                    chief inspector and he friends, of course, who were inspectors. Our first
                    inspection which I think occurred in the first year I was there, and the
                    inspector asked me where I'd like to be posted in the next year or two. And I
                    said, “Anywhere but Latin America,” and he turned out to be a Latin American
                    inspector, so that was another step backwards. [Laughter] So my initiation was
                    anything but pleasant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, your next posting was to Bern, which is not one of
                        our most active posts, or at least I wouldn't think it would be. You were
                        there from 1951 to 1953. What type of work were you doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Well, I was in the peculiar assignment that they invented called reporter.
                    It was a semi-intelligence operation. I can't remember. Special reporter is what
                    it amounted to and beside the political section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wouldn't this normally be the type of thing the CIA would
                        do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Well, yes, but this is a brainchild of somebody in the Foreign Service who
                    thought that there was some special activities that the Foreign Service officers
                    could do and at least be complementary and supplementary to the actual
                    intelligence operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And, of course, I guess this is the time when the CIA was
                        just being put together anyway, so it wasn't that strong an apparatus.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: It was a hell of lot more together than naught, but when I was in the CIA,
                    it became CIA. It used to be known as the CIG, Central Intelligence Group. CIA
                    was formed and there was going unit of the CIA in Bern.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Switzerland at that point as much of an intelligence
                        area between East and West as one is led to believe from all the spy
                        novels?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Right. I believe that was the reason we were sent there, that I was sent
                    there at any rate.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You can add these things on. Again, this is obviously an
                        unclassified interview, but we are talking about something of almost 40
                        years ago. Looking back on it, did we get much good information there or was
                        it mostly defensive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: I would say that generally it was well covered and better covered by the
                    CIA, and I was in great respects simply a fifth wheel spinning around more or
                    less by myself. Whatever I got that what I thought was worth anything I would
                    pass it by the CIA station chief and his people. The only thing I was able to
                    get through the diplomatic channels was because of the consul in Basel, who was
                    of Norwegian descent, and he had very good contacts. He was a great help to me,
                    introducing me to people, and through them I got a copy of the communist
                    manifesto, the first time we got our fingers on it. That was, as I say, through
                    diplomatic means.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You knew somebody who knew somebody who got it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: And he knew somebody who produced it. That was very helpful, and I'm sure
                    it went back to Washington by the CIA and not us, because we had a back channel
                    but it was very, very . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Korean War came in June of 1950 and you were in Europe
                        at the time. There really was a major shift toward realizing that we were in
                        a period of confrontation, which is maybe basically still going on today in
                        1989. Did you in Switzerland see the machinery beginning to move into this
                        new pasture?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Well, I felt that, but mostly I would be, pursued by this what you would
                    call this homosexual aspect, because, as I told you, the previous administrative
                    officer had been kicked out because he was a homosexual, and lo and behold,
                    there was a nest of homosexuals in the CIA in Switzerland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might add, because times and mores have changed some,
                        that homosexuals were considered to be at great risk from a security point
                        of view, and with justification in that the Soviets would often use this as
                        a threat of exposure unless you did things for them. So there you were.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: So there I was, in the one place that you would least expect it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Particularly in the CIA.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>KOREN: The CIA and the section chief himself. So that sort of soured my outlook
                    on the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The State Department had, of course, a reputation, the
                        whole overseas establishment, of being what in modern parity would be an
                        excessive number of gays.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>You had a military furlough between 1953 and 1958. What was this exactly and what
                    caused this?</p>
                <p>KOREN: That was of my doing because of my feeling of outright disgust at this
                    aspect of the Foreign Service, considering the CIA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And also you were assigned to relatively non-challenging
                        posts at the time, too. It wasn't sort of the fun posts.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Very pleasant posts, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Pleasant, but not—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: But the real work of the Foreign Service was in the economic field as far
                    as Switzerland was concerned. Well, that added some problems within the embassy
                    itself. At that time the ambassador was a fellow who was a non-career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a minister. And this was Richard C. Patterson?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Yes, Dickie.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what was he like? Was he just a social butterfly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: He was a grasping, pretentious man who had no morals at all, absolutely
                    none. That was another thing that . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You really came in—of course and also coming in at the
                        mid-level one is less tolerant. When one is young and first in, you say,
                        “Well, this will pass.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: You've got your career ahead of you.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. But when you come in at the middle—you were very
                        unfortunate, really.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Well, unfortunate, except from the point of view of the atmosphere around
                    was very bad. I mean, I don't want to run down any individual, but this man
                    Patterson had no morals at all. He was absolutely inscrutable. We would have to
                    go there once in a while to dinner, and it was very embarrassing for me and
                    disgusting for my wife. He had these floozies that he was playing around with
                    all the time. So what it amounted to was I was ready to quit or something, and I
                    talked to friends who had some influence in the military, and I was offered a
                    job in the Army, an active duty commission again in the Army and so I grabbed
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What type of work were you doing in the Army?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: That was the best job that anybody could ask for. That was in Berlin and I
                    was the staff assistant, I guess they call it, to the commander of Berlin. Then
                    I was made the chief of staff of the Allied staff, which meant working for the
                    three allies commandants, and that was a tremendous, interesting, and exciting
                    job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it was an exciting period, too, of course, when
                        tensions were at really their height. You were a colonel by this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Yes, I was a colonel. I was promoted in '45 to a full colonel and so that
                    when they assigned me to active duty, I reassumed the same rank. That lasted
                    until '58.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What brought you back into the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Well, I was assigned to the White House. I was executive assistant in the
                    White House.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in the military at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: I was still in the military. I could see that I was going between two
                    schools that were spreading apart, so I had to make a choice and I decided for
                    various reasons the Foreign Service was where I should be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have some trepidation before going back in, having
                        had the bad experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>KOREN: Oh, yes. The bad experience, and also the fact that I was considered sort
                    of a piranha and somebody who was untrustworthy. [Chuckles]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this is the thing. You'd been in posts which had had
                        bad problems and then you had left, which, for the military, is like
                        deserting in Foreign Service terms. [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: They thought I had deserted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: As a matter of interest, they took me out of the Foreign Service register,
                    I mean the State Department register. Isn't that what we call it?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. The biographic list.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: The biographic register, yes. They just edited me out. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's the Foreign Service equivalent of ripping your
                        buttons off and sending you out in the cold. Well, did you have any trouble
                        getting back in? Did you have to pass any board?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Yes, I had very definite troubles, because the—I won't mention names—but
                    the head of the Foreign Service personnel had that feeling of, “Well, he's a
                    deserter and screw him.” And a friend of mine, a man I greatly admired, asked
                    for me by name, and they said, “Impossible.” They even wanted to stop my
                    promotion from Class 3 to Class 2. It was Chip Bohlen, and he was not in the
                    highest favor of the hierarchy of the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was during the McCarthy period, and he was the
                        preeminent Foreign Service officer. But he had been interpreter at Yalta and
                        all this, and so there's an attempt to make him the fall guy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Yes. But he persisted and when I left the White House, President
                    Eisenhower wrote me a very nice letter thanking me for my services and so forth,
                    and I happened to receive that the day I went over to see what had happened to
                    my assignment that Bohlen had requested. As I say, I had it in my hand at that
                    time. I just received it, so I walked over to where it was in the old days.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Walter Johnson Building, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Yes, Walter Johnson Building. And I pulled my letter out and said, “Maybe
                    that'll help a little.” Well, of course it did. I was not only promoted, but I
                    was given the job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we move on, when you were in the White House
                        working on the equivalent of was it the NSC or the equivalent to the
                        NSC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: No, it was a special assignment that General Eisenhower had requested. He
                    wanted a study of our worldwide bases, and he had tapped a man named Frank Nash,
                    who had been the special assistant to Mr. Forrestal in Defense and then became
                    the first ISA in Defense. And he was tapped for the job and he tapped me as his
                    assistant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, tell me on this subject, because I've seen it in my
                        service abroad, one of the problems we had in recent years and for some time
                        has been these bases. While they have a military value, there is usually a
                        very high political price on them. I'm thinking in Greece and France, other
                        places. Troops don't really of any country get along very well. I mean,
                        there are problems. Were we trying to balance off political and military
                        considerations? Or were we saying, “All right. There may be a war with the
                        Soviet Union and we needed bases here, here, and here, and the political
                        costs will have to be taken care of at some later date”? What was our
                        attitude?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Ours was sort of a general survey of the amalgam of both sides, and the
                    idea was, I think, Mr. Eisenhower really started off with the point of view of
                    we have too many commitments abroad and we should try to narrow them down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it was in this light, that point of view?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: From that point of view, what was essential and was not essential. And my
                    report is still gathering dust in various echelons of the government, and it was
                    a fairly thick report, about that thick.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're motioning about an inch.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>KOREN: It was worldwide, and one of the benefits from my point of view was that
                    we traveled everywhere, we went to all the bases, and so it was an education.
                    And we had support, of course, from the military, but more and more
                    interestingly, we had—oh, I can't remember—about four or five Foreign Service
                    officers who were our resources in that respect. Marshall Green, for example,
                    was one and Mack Godley was another. Do you remember him?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. You certainly had high caliber.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Well, you know I found out that when you're in the White House, you just
                    say, “I want so and so,” and they have the habit of coming. We just had a
                    wonderful group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, moving on. You were appointed political counselor to
                        our embassy in Manila. You served from 1958 to 1960 under Ambassador Charles
                        Bohlen, Chip Bohlen. In the first place, Ambassador Bohlen was a real
                        authority on the Soviet Union. How did he end up in the Philippines?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Because of the differences with Foster Dulles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Well, Foster Dulles was a dyed-in-the-wool Republican and conservative and
                    Chip was a Democrat and a liberal, and they just did not get along together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this is really to put him out to pasture in a
                        way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Yes, put him to pasture. They had to give him a job, and it was a tough
                    job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what were our interests and our situation in the
                        Philippines? We're talking about 1958 when you first arrived.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Well, we had, of course, primarily an issue on the bases.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the one at Subic Bay?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Well, we had three bases. We had Subic Bay and we had Clark Field and we
                    had Langley Point.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Actually, the name escapes me, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: That was a key problem we had in the Philippines. Then, of course, we had
                    ongoing problems of veterans and immigration and economic problems. The
                    Philippines political problems were constantly turning around, and the basis for
                    it all was what we just called it G&amp;C—graft and corruption.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we deal with the problem of corruption and graft?
                        We always take a high and mighty attitude about this, but in many countries
                        this is what makes things run. Were we hurting ourselves, or were we going
                        along? How did we operate in the Philippines in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: We hurt ourselves. I mean, we felt it but naturally we went along with a
                    certain amount of it, and there was very little of the sudden jerking of the
                    rein and saying, “Enough is enough.” That was primarily the ambassador's job. In
                    effect, he would go to see the president or somebody—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the president at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Well, Garc�a was the actual president at that time. It was just after the
                    Philippines' Magsaysay had been killed.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>KOREN: It became Garc�a, and he was a go-along politician.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Magsaysay had been painted in heroic terms, but on the
                        ground as a political counselor in 1958 and three years thereafter, what was
                        your impression of Magsaysay's impact and his accomplishments?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: I'd say he accomplished a great deal. I never knew him because he had been
                    killed by the time I got there, but I knew Diem very well, although he had left
                    at the time. I knew him in Vietnam. But I'd say Magsaysay had a exorbitantly
                    high reputation, and how he would have handled the problems that developed, I
                    don't know.</p>

                        Huk insurgency—had pretty well died down by this time. Is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Well, yes. They had died down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the problems were really one of having a viable
                        economy with the problems of the ruling class and their corruption and the
                        graft?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Yes, I think that's probably right. Underlying everything was the problem
                    of the “haves” and the “have nots.” That's endemic for every underdeveloped
                    country, as you well know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What could we do about the situation? I mean, it had been
                        our colony, but were we still acting as a colonial power or was it really
                        “hands off,” saying “This is your problem”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: No. I'd say primarily our attitude was and had to be a friendly counselor,
                    and we had certain principles and certain institutions which we respected. We
                    tried to guide them according to our principles in that respect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we do this? You're the political counselor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Talking to the people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You talked to the people, but, one, you talk to the people
                        and somebody's getting paid. If you're talking to the people receiving
                        graft, it takes an awful lot more than talking to get somebody to stop
                        taking money.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Well, from my point of view, we had no authority in the sense of “you must
                    not do that” parental type of authority. We could only say, “That's very
                    difficult and it will give you trouble in the long run.” Sometimes it would take
                    and sometimes it wouldn't, but basically it was mostly, I would say, a friendly
                    persuasion. [Chuckles]</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you see the political situation there? Was it a
                        healthy political situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>KOREN: No. Very chaotic and changeable. To give you an example, the two people
                    that I considered my best friends in the Philippines were Ferdinand Marcos and
                    Benigno Aquino, and they couldn't have been more opposite, as you well know. The
                    thing that went on that I did not know that I've found out since then there was
                    some underground things that the CIA was perfectly—not perfectly, but
                    fairly—cognizant that I knew nothing about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here you were. You had been within the CIA orbit at one
                        time. One of the complaints has often been that the CIA operates and gets
                        things which it does not share to those whom it should. What I gather is
                        that you didn't feel it was a very good cooperation in that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Well, I felt I had all the cooperation that I needed from the CIA. In
                    fact, I had more than I needed in some respects that they were looking to me for
                    introductions to various people. And one of the last nights I spent was with the
                    CIA station chief at that time and the Marcos, Imelda and Freddie Marcos,
                    because the CIA station chief knew I knew him and asked me if I would give him a
                    leg up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What position did Marcos have at the time you knew of him,
                        and how did you evaluate him then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: I evaluated him as a very ambitious individual who had considerable
                    talent, talent in the political sense, and he knew that as far as running the
                    Philippines and being president of the Philippines, which he is, was his
                    objective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was he at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: When I first knew him he was a congressman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying Ferdinand Marcos was a congressman.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Marcos was a congressman and then he became a senator. And the thing that
                    is interesting to me was that in the Philippines at that time you had elections,
                    everybody voted for whomever they wanted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anywhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Anywhere. And the person who came out on top was marked from then on as
                    the number one. They used to say, “Number one, number one.”</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're pointing the forefinger up in the air.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: That's to indicate number one. And he was number one in the congressional
                    race, he was number one in the senatorial race. So he was doubly marked, I would
                    say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What made him so popular?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Well, he was a very good politician. He was fast with his tongue and made
                    a great deal of promises, and never underestimate the power of a woman. He would
                    go out to the housings, you know the Philippine housing, the barrios, are not
                    noted for their intelligence, and he knew just the right touch. He'd grown up
                    that way, and his wife, Imelda, was a perfect counterpart. She would sing and he
                    would talk for 20 minutes on without a note and then she would sing, and it was
                    the most popular combination that you could imagine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we did we see this as a couple at that time, saying,
                        “Maybe they have the right touch to bring the Philippines together”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: They were the best possible bet for cohesiveness on the part of the
                    Philippines and the part of the Philippine people. In other words, they used to
                    say Marcos was tremendously popular, which he was, and this couple was
                    tremendously popular. I'll hark back to that dinner I had for Marcos and the
                    station chief. At that time he outlined a modern, two-way, very authoritarian
                    government. In other words, there had to be one person on the top who called all
                    the shots, and he was the man who was going to do it. Well, Diem tried to do it
                    in Vietnam, for example. So he looked like the best bet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said your other best friend was Benigno Aquino, who
                        was the slain husband of the president of the Philippines. How did Benigno
                        Aquino seem to you at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Benigno, we used to call him the “Boy Wonder of Tarlac,” because he was
                    very young. At 35 years, he was the governor of a province, and he was much,
                    much more intellectually endowed than Marcos. Marcos had smarts; he was sort of
                    a street politician. But Benigno thought in terms of issues and he was a very
                    articulate man and a very intelligent man, and I think he would have been a
                    great president of the Philippines if he had lived.</p>

                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>KOREN: He would give you an assignment, and you would be expected to fulfill
                    that. If you had any questions, you would come back and say, “I can't do it,” or
                    “I need help,” and he would give you whatever help he thought was appropriate.
                    To me, he was a great individual, but he had also very strict principles. He was
                    a very intelligent and wise—you know, “The Wise Men.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There's a book called The Wise Men, in which he was one
                        included about American foreign policy after World War II.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Yes. That was an extraordinarily good book, if you haven't read it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have read it, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: At any rate, Chip would, as I say, give you an assignment within your
                    field, he would expect you to do something. He had very high standards, but he
                    was also a very kind and worldly man. He exemplified his background and his
                    training and was unquestionably the best ambassador I ever worked for.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the staff at the embassy? I mean, you had
                        a bad experience, both in Bern and Switzerland, and now you're back in the
                        Foreign Service. How well do you feel you were served by the staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: I had a very good section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the political section.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Political section. The DCM was a very likable, gentle person, who also had
                    high standards just like Bohlen and, of course, he was more approachable. Bohlen
                    was still the ambassador and as far as I was concerned, he was always
                    approachable, but the DCM was more of a friend, a colleague type of person. As I
                    say, he was a gentle and sympathetic type of person. I had a little problem
                    there that the man who I replaced didn't like the idea and he was still there
                    for a while, but that worked itself out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Often in the Foreign Service you don't really overlap with
                        the person you replace, which has its strong points and its weak points. The
                        weak point is that you don't pass on knowledge. The strong point is
                        sometimes there is not the greatest cooperation between the two. There's a
                        resentment.</hi>

                        specifically asked for you, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Yes. It was a very, very pleasant time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a pleasant time, but also it sounds like a very

                </p>
                <p>KOREN: It was.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel the cooperation from the State
                        Department, from the bureau and all. It wasn't Henry Robertson, or was it at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Walter Robertson. We got from the staff of the Department, I think, all of
                    the cooperation we needed to get.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feeling that because of Dulles' animosity
                        toward Bohlen that sometimes this carries over into the whole Departmental
                        feeling toward the whole post?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: No. I think mostly that the Department attitude—of course, I was not in
                    the Department at that time—they, I think, pretty generally felt that Bohlen
                    would do a good job no matter where he was, and yet this is sort of a strange
                    place for him to be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well then he moved from there. Kennedy appointed him
                        to Paris.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: The first thing that happened was Christian Herter—</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who took over from Dulles.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: I can remember Chip's relief, because Herter was a Harvard man and a
                    friend of his. But from the point of view of the working of the embassy, of
                    course, anything would work well under Bohlen and Mrs. Bohlen, and we had the
                    best time in the world.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: He just wanted a man that he felt he could trust in Southeast Asian
                    Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, Harriman had this rather unusual appointment as
                        assistant secretary for Asian Affairs when he was a man who was certainly
                        eligible to have been—well, he aspired to be President, with a good reason,
                        but also to be Secretary of State, and yet he accepted this position in
                        Asian Affairs and it was not a sinecure at all. How would you describe
                        Harriman as an operator, working under Harriman in Asian Affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Well, to be quite frank, I was pretty much scared to death most of the
                    time. I didn't know Harriman. I had met him before, but it was purely social.
                    His daughter was a friend of mine. You probably heard that Harriman was
                    considered the crocodile.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: That's exactly the way it was. I used to go in and see him once in a while
                    for various things, and I'd come back and I'd hold my arms up to my cheek and
                    wonder where the blood was coming from.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he treat you in these things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Roughly. If you didn't measure up in his opinion and didn't grasp the
                    fundamental question quickly, he would tear you apart. He'd say, “What are you
                    standing up there for that way? Good God, man.” You know, he was very rough in
                    language. He didn't mean anything. He was very kindhearted personally, but he
                    was a very tension-making individual to work for. To give you an example, two or
                    three times he'd say, “Are you going to be in tomorrow?”</p>
                <p>I'd say, “Sir, tomorrow's Sunday.”</p>
                <p>And he said, “Oh, yes, that's right. I forget, you're a Christer [sic].”</p>
                <p>But the first thing I would do in the morning was to get all the messages that
                    had been piled up overnight and race through those just as fast as I could. I
                    would get there well ahead of what I expected the governor to get there, because
                    he would call up all of a sudden and he would have seen a message and he would
                    jump in the middle of the message and ask you, “What do you think so and so?”
                    Well, if you didn't know just what the hell he was talking about, you'd
                    [stutter], and so that was something I think we all did. I did it because I had
                    to reply to him. All the people who worked for me had to do it because I would
                    ask them, and the old story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, it moves down.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: All around the chain of command, it just moves down. It was exhilarating.
                    You couldn't work for Harriman without feeling there was something going on.
                    There was not. Not tension, but excitement in the air, electricity, all the

                        been right at the top of your list. This was the time when I can remember
                        President Kennedy getting up and having maps on television and talking about
                        Laos. The idea was to neutralize Laos, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: That became the objective after a period of time, but, of course, the
                    North Vietnamese took that option away from us. Our great problem with Laos was
                    trying to find somebody that we could rely on.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KOREN: That if one fell all the rest of them would fall one after another.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would your job be during the Laotian crisis, when we
                        were looking for some way to put this thing together and we were talking
                        about committing troops. There were all the options. This is for the
                        researcher who doesn't understand how the State Department operates, and so
                        I'd like to have an idea of what type of thing one would do as the director
                        of this office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: As I say, our national objective in Laos, for example, was to find a
                    leader on whom we could put some authority and whom we could shore up. We tried
                    several of them, and we finally came, because of Harriman mostly, to Souvanna
                    Phouma. He was admittedly considered a communist fellow traveler, but he was the
                    man that we had felt could neutralize and make Laos a neutral government. We
                    would instruct the embassy on certain aspects of suggestions. For instance, it
                    was also the time of Prince Sihanouk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Cambodia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Yes. And we would suggest to them that such and such a demarche might have
                    some effect on Sihanouk and so forth. In other words, it was primarily from our
                    point of view, what we wanted to do was think up new ideas and if they had not
                    been tried, we would send out messages suggesting them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you have a feeling at the time that no matter
                        what we do, we sure as hell aren't going to put troops in there? In your
                        thinking and the people around you, were putting troops into Laos, Cambodia,
                        and all one of the options that you felt was a viable option?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: No. That was not in our thinking at all at that time. In those days, our
                    job was to keep the governments viable and keep them oriented favorably toward
                    the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you see Thailand as being a sort of a rock on

                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Well, Thailand was, comparatively speaking, a very firm bit of soil that
                    we knew where we were when we planted our feet on the soil of Thailand. They had
                    people with whom we were on pretty good terms and who we felt we could trust.
                    For instance, the foreign minister of Thailand. I knew him very well but I can't
                    think of his name right now. That was the monarchy and the monarchy was
                    flourishing with a fireball operation, and so they had something basic to go on.
                    They had a government underneath the monarchy, a representative type government,
                    and so it was something we could understand and which we could support.</p>

                        considerable concern to you at the time, because it was a very close-run
                        thing, that the communists may have taken over Indonesia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: I didn't have Indonesia under my . . .</p>

                </p>
                <p>KOREN: I think the fact that they succeeded in ousting Sukarno and getting rid of
                    him certainly backed up our efforts in Southeast Asia.</p>

                <p>KOREN: You know, anything that Harriman runs, he runs himself. He doesn't need
                    any help. I know he talked to Rusk. We had a thing in Laos, for example, where
                    several allied—if that's the word for them—discussions on Laos, and the director
                    for Southeast Asian Affairs was directly responsible for Laos. I was always
                    tapped to make the expos� on Laos from the point of view of the U.S. Butler was
                    the foreign minister of Britain at that time. I can't remember who was the
                    French minister. At any rate, that's the only time I really had anything to do
                    with Rusk.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to tell him anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Nothing, except that we knew that they had been captured and were put in
                    the Army personnel carrier. That's all we knew at that time. We didn't know
                    until afterwards that they had been shot.</p>
                <p>But you're quite right. One of the methods Mr. Kennedy had of getting right down
                    to the last man he thought would know the answer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know this as a personal aside. My name is Kennedy, and

                        name is Kennedy.” And all of a sudden, electricity would start shooting out
                        and I'd have to quickly explain who I was, because everybody in the
                        Department was rather nervous that the President might be calling.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: You're quite right. He did. You're quite right that Southeast Asian
                    affairs, particularly in Vietnam, was number one in his priority, very close to
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You moved out of here all of a sudden. You were appointed

                        1966. How did this come about? I mean, here you were in Southeast Asian
                        Affairs, and all of a sudden you're off to a country in Africa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Well, I suspect that what it was was Kennedy was looking around for people
                    that were recommended to him, and I had been recommended to him probably by
                    Harriman. There was the question of, “Where could he go?” and at that time, the
                    repository for career Foreign Service officers was Africa. They didn't mind, as
                    long as somebody had been selected to be an ambassador and had passed all
                    through the White House vetting, which they did. Mr. Kennedy did. He had one
                    person particularly who was the selector of ambassadors.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who told everybody not to submit resignations as called
                        for by protocol and they went ahead with most of the appointments.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: No, no. I didn't have any specific notification from anybody in the White
                    House except the man who selected ambassadors. He was a career ambassador
                    selector, so I was just all of a sudden one.</p>

                <p>KOREN: That's right. Frankly, I was glad to be selected.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also, I imagine by that time you were glad to be out of
                        the hot house of the Southeast Asian thing, which was just getting more and
                        more intense all the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Well, as a matter of fact, to be quite frank, my satisfaction at being
                    selected, knowing to be selected as ambassador, outweighed my relief or
                    anything. I enjoyed Southeast Asian Affairs. I had a lot of fun in it. I would
                    be happy to stay there.</p>

                        call it the Congo, because the state remained called the Congo, but at one
                        point there was a Congo (Leopoldville) and a Congo (Brazzaville), and later
                        the Belgian Congo turned into Zaire, but we'll just call it the Congo. But
                        what were our interests in the Congo? We're talking about 1964.</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Brazzaville, yes.KOREN: Very small. Quite a few of
                        phosphates, but primarily it was a foothold on the corner of Africa, which
                        was, at that time when I went there, there were, as I remember, 23
                        embassies, all of whom were Western oriented. When I left, I suppose there
                        were six: Britain, France, U.S., West Germany. And the rest of them were all
                        communists: North Korea, China—</hi>

                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Yes. Well, the time they were there, they were all Western oriented.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in the first place, when you went there, what was
                        the government of the Congo and what was its outlook? We're talking about
                        1964, when you first arrived.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: They had a brand-new independent government.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It had been part of the French empire at one time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Had been part of the French empire, and like all the African nations, they
                    were emerging in independence. The first election had been held and the
                    president elected. And it was, as I say, primarily a West-oriented regime, but
                    that changed historic Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You've made sort of a flip-over sign. What caused the

                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Well, it had not been a great earthshaking event as far as the U.S.
                    Government was concerned. It was primarily from the point of view of those who
                    were assigned there. It amounted to the fact that the prime minister was
                    communist oriented and he was the one who called the shots, and he was the one
                    who began a change to a one-party system, and the whole thing suddenly did a 180

                        a decision on the part of the prime minister?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: No. The military power behind the man who did it, but there was no
                    bloodshed or anything spent at all. There was some terrorist action, but no
                    bloodshed at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would assume that before this switch came, the French
                        had predominate influence there. Did they play any role in trying to stop
                        this? Did you cooperate with them, or were we trying to do anything, or was
                        there anything we could do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Well, there was nothing we could do, and the French were there, background
                    influence and aid, didn't do anything drastic at all. They allowed it to
                    happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you feel that maybe if they had really turned the

                </p>
                <p>KOREN: If they had turned the screws around, they could have—I wouldn't say they
                    could have stopped it, but they could have certainly slowed it down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you over talking to the French ambassador and saying,
                        “My God, why don't you do something?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: No. We tried that, and he was a completely useless individual.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you feel it was more ineptitude on the part of the
                        French?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: I think it was lack of foresight on the part of the French. They didn't
                    realize what was happening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn't a matter of just letting it go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: It wasn't a question of washing their hands. All of a sudden they woke up
                    and found their hands were sticky.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the first place, how important was phosphate to us? Was
                        this sort of driving our interest in the area, or was it just a minor . .

                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>KOREN: No, minor. We had no major interest in there at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We had, we felt, the whole Western European group had a
                        lot of interest in what was happening at that time in the Congo,
                        particularly the efforts of Katanga to break away and you had the Simba
                        revolt. How did that play in the Congo (Brazzaville)?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Well, of course, that became affluent. At the time when we were there, the
                    major problems were with the former Belgian Congo, Congo-leo, and the most
                    extraordinary thing, each that we called the “Big Congo” and the “Little Congo”
                    watched each other like leopards, interpreting every move as a hostile move.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were absolutely—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Impeccable. There was so much jealousy between the two. In the old days,
                    from talking with Mack Godley and others, the people from the Congo
                    (Leopoldville) would come over for wine and cheese and fun in Brazzaville. But
                    when we were there, the laces were completely severed, and we were not allowed
                    to cross over to—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was just across the river, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: It was across the river, yes. And the river, you know, at that point is
                    very swift moving, but it's hardly an obstacle. You get across there in a
                    rowboat if you took your time and knew how to do it. And that was above the
                    falls.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you really feel what was happening there was sort of
                        isolated, it wasn't impacted anywhere else?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: It was only of interest to the representatives that were there who were
                    immediately affected.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you feel that you were close to being expelled
                        at some point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Oh, yes. Several times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way, did we care?</hi>

                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>KOREN: No. I don't think they gave a damn in Washington.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KOREN: They didn't give a damn.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I must say that when I look up the Congo (Brazzaville) in
                        the publications which deal all over the world, there are some years when it
                        doesn't even appear. Could you deal with the government there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: I could in the beginning, but even offers or threats of taking away aid—we
                    had very little aid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They couldn't care less?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: They couldn't care less. It was what you might call a nonprofitable
                    existence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, sometimes a part of the justification is, “Okay, you
                        keep the flag flying, because you don't know what's going to happen.” I
                        mean, these things can turn around, and if you walk away, you're not there
                        to take advantage. Did you have that feeling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: When I was pulled out of there in May, I think as far as the Department
                    was concerned and as far as the U.S. Government was concerned, they could have
                    shut down the place completely and not have missed it. And I came back and I
                    argued from the point of view of keeping the flag flying and primarily as a
                    listening post. This was the core of the spread of communism in Central Africa,
                    and I said, “Just keep somebody there. I don't care who the hell it is.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of things were you getting from your position
                        there? Were you getting an idea of how the communist movement was working
                        within the area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Yes. See how it might spread, what were the things that were attractive to
                    the masses and how they were playing them in the Congo and how that could be
                    transplanted to another entity, another nation.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Surprisingly enough, I had a large staff, because it had been right from
                    the beginning. For instance, we had FAA people there and that sort of thing, and
                    we had international representatives, WHO and international aviation people and
                    that sort of thing, so we had, from the point of view of our intrinsic
                    interests, we had a much larger staff than we really needed, but they were
                    regional people.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that being phased down while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Well, yes. I mean, after I left, I guess six months after that, they shut
                    down the embassy completely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We might move on then to your major assignment. You left
                        Brazzaville in 1966, and for a very short time you were with Intelligence
                        and Research. And then you were made, as I have it here, deputy to the
                        deputy ambassador in Saigon from 1966 to 1968. How did that assignment come
                        about, and what was your position?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Well, they wanted somebody to in effect run the counterinsurgency
                    effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's CORDS, C-O-R-D-S.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: It wasn't named CORDS at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the history of the counterinsurgency movement
                        from our side prior to your being appointed there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Rather bleak, as a matter of fact. You're probably aware of the failure of
                    the hearts and minds of the people and the over-optimistic reports that were put
                    out by the enemy's government, and various efforts had been tried and this was
                    an effort to pull everything together. Probably, that was the reason that I
                    was—</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there during a sort of major dispute of who's

                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Well, I think that was the reason the State Department won and I was sent

                </p>
                <p>KOREN: My immediate boss was Bill Porter, who was the deputy ambassador, but I
                    had direct access to Cabot Lodge.</p>

                    you have to do, now go ahead and do it.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of things were they saying you had to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Well, make order out of chaos. What they wanted was somebody to take
                    charge and make the decisions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is fine, but here you're talking about subduing a
                        counterinsurgency in a country and we're an outside power. What did you have
                        to deal with it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: You had the various units, the AID, USIA, and, of course, the ever-present
                    military.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: American military.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: To be quite honest with you, it was a very confusing situation, and I
                    didn't know enough about what was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Later they have developed rather fancy courses in
                        counterinsurgency, but there was none of this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Oh, no, no. You just were there, and, to be quite frank with you, I didn't
                    know much. It wasn't until I went up to I Corps, the First Corps area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's up north from the demilitarized zone down to Quang
                        Ngai Province.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>KOREN: That was when I realized—of course, I had been in Saigon for maybe two or
                    three months. I knew something was going on, but I remember responding to a
                    correspondents question at one time what the situation was, and I said,
                    “Confused.” And it was terribly confused down there. Everybody was trying to do
                    his thing, and we had USIA, we had AID, and we had the military.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about you were going up to I Corps because
                        you found that you really didn't know what was going on after you'd been
                        there for several months.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: They kicked me up there. That's beside the point, but Rusk and McNamara
                    and all those came out, and they didn't like what I said, so they said, “Get rid
                    of that bastard.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you saying?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: I was trying to tell them that I didn't know what the problem was, and I
                    made one major mistake because I said at the beginning, “You know, I think we
                    ought to find some other term besides 'pacification,'” and oh, boy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whose favorite word was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: I don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It strikes me as McNamara. Maybe I'm wrong.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: I think it probably was McNamara, I don't know. It was the wrong thing to
                    say and they told me to forget about it. [Laughter] So they gave me the
                    opportunity of going back to the Department, and I said, “Well, I was over there
                    and I wanted to stay.”</p>
                <p>So Cabot Lodge said, “Well, how would you like to go up to I Corps?”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Fine.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were placed by somebody, or was the job once again
                        re-changed when you left Saigon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: It was changed. There was no boss, I think. As a matter of fact, it was
                    taken over by President Johnson, and he sent one of his men out there, whose
                    name I've forgotten.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Komer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Komer, Bob Komer. He was supposed to do it, and he was the one who, at
                    that time—I don't know whether it was Bob or—before that it became Civil
                    Operations Revolutionary Developments. But the whole problem was rethought, the
                    whole effort, and the people, as I was in I Corps, became the deputy to the
                    commander for Civil Operations Revolutionary Development.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So basically you became a part of the military, rather
                        than being run out of the embassy at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, at least in the field.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Yes. It was all part and parcel of the mission consul. That was a meeting
                    that was held by the ambassador every day, as I recall, chaired by the
                    ambassador, and that had all the elements in it: USIA, AID, the heads of those
                    agencies, the political counselor, who was Phil Habib at that time, Rog and
                    Westmoreland, and the whole lot of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we move up to I Corps, what was your impression of
                        some of the people. Let's talk about Lodge first. How deeply engaged was he
                        with the operations there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: I think he was completely immersed in it, and his effort was primarily in
                    making and helping to obtain a viable Vietnamese government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In some ways, you must have had a feeling of a certain
                        harking back to the Laotian situation, because this is a period of time when
                        there were revolving military governments, weren't there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: A very austere individual, Cabot Lodge, and very stiff and somewhat
                    unbending, but a very nice person underneath. When you got down underneath the
                    facade, so to speak, he was a very nice gent. I liked him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Bill Porter?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>KOREN: Bill Porter was very smart, very good, and in a quiet way, very effective.
                    For instance, I remember one refrain that he often used, not in a negative sense
                    or to get under Westie's skin or anything like that, but he would say, “But the
                    night belongs to the VC.” And, sort of in a plaintive way, we all felt that. It
                    was a tough operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about Westmoreland?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Well, I think he was a very good commander in what you might call the
                    normal sense. I mean, West, he had everything you'd expect of a leader. He had
                    knowledge, he had brains, he got people out of their foxholes and that sort of
                    thing. But he was a product—so was I—of the World War II, and I don't think he
                    understood. I don't think he found the key. God knows who has the key to
                    guerilla warfare, the type of warfare we were facing in Vietnam. For instance,
                    “The night belongs to the VC.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did you feel? You arrived there and your first
                        few months you were looking at the situation. How was the war going from our
                        point of view? How did you see it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Well, we got the impression it was going all right, and it wasn't until
                    the Tet Offensive—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In February of '68. But at the time you saw it, did you
                        see the guerilla warfare and the “night belonging to the VC” as being an
                        absolute must that you had to conquer, and did you see progress in this? Or
                        did you see this as being almost an irritant?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Well, it was a terrible irritant, but the progress was gauged primarily by
                    the body count, and God knows we had enough of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any feeling that this body count business—I
                        mean, one, politically it's not the best way to judge something, and the
                        other one is, when you start relying on statistics, whether they're bodies
                        or what have you, you're asking for real problems. You know, people meeting
                        norms, double counting, counting civilians as Viet Cong, etc., etc., etc.
                        Were we questioning this as a way of measuring how we were doing, or was
                        this pretty much the accepted?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Pretty much accepted at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time. All these things are so much easier in
                        retrospect.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>KOREN: Very much so. But this was a low-intensity conflict, and all of our
                    training and background had been in the high-intensity conflict.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling when you arrived there about the
                        ARVN, the Army of the Republic of Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: It was coming along but slowly, and that was one of the things we tried
                    our damnedest to—I say “we,” the United States Government and all its efforts
                    were trying to shore up the ARVN, give them some backbone, something strong to
                    lean on, and I think that was the biggest failure that we had there. Some of the
                    ARVN were fine. Some of the ARVN people were good friends of mine and sort of
                    young men as a whole.</p>
                <p>I can remember thinking back to the South Vietnamese day, Southeast Asian day,
                    “What is it that the communists have that we don't seem to be able to instill in
                    our people? Where's the fire?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a question I think all of us have asked again and
                        again. Obviously, the men in the Vietnamese Army really had a lot to lose, I
                        mean, it's very obvious, when the place went down the drain. Yet, what was
                        it that didn't spark the leadership at all levels to exert itself in this?
                        Do you ever have any feel for why the communists seemed to do it and we
                        didn't?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: No. That's still a comment that I don't have the answer to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have to confess I thought long and hard about it, too. I
                        don't know, but there is something there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: God knows the war colleges are doing their best to try to find the key to
                    leadership right now. Sometimes it works. The most recent example is Hackworth.
                    Do you know that story?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. There's a book. Was it called Turn About or
                        something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: No. About Face.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: About Face, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>KOREN: Well, Dave Hackworth was an Army officer who kicked against the traces,
                    but he was considered the finest battalion commander that—I can't remember who
                    said so, whether it was Westmoreland or—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Abrams?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Or even higher up—they'd ever seen, and you can see why. He had three
                    Distinguished Service Crosses. He had nine Silver Stars. He had three or four
                    Purple Hearts. You know, you name it. He was the most decorated man. I mean, he
                    makes Woodfield, or whatever the hell his name was—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: York?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: York. Pale, and also, Douglas MacArthur. He has something on his side. He
                    says we have yet to learn how to fight that type of warfare. He said we didn't
                    do it in Vietnam, and he got disgusted with Vietnam and he sort of threw by the
                    faces of Westmoreland and all the rest of the generals. He himself was not made
                    a general and so he quit. That's beside the point, but . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, no. But it's an interesting point. Now, when you went
                        up to I Corps, could you describe a bit the command structure and where you
                        fit into this? We're still talking about 1966, aren't we?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Well, at that time, Lou Walt, who was a Marine. The Marines were in charge
                    of I Corps and he was the Marine commander and the next in command to the ARVN
                    commander, whose name was Lam. I fitted into that very nicely, because Lou and I
                    became very good friends and close friends, and he gave me every opportunity,
                    every chance in the world, to do whatever I felt was necessary, he would okay.
                    He was the commander, though.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: The first thing I did was to fire the AID people and change the command
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>KOREN: Well, they just weren't any good, that's all basically. AID, I got rid of
                    them, and I got a new man in the CIA and USIA. They were all sort of grouped
                    together. We worked together, the three or four of us, we worked together. I'll
                    say one thing. I had a hell of a time getting my deputy changed, because the
                    Department did not back me up. I asked for a guy by name and they said, “Oh, we
                    can't spare him. He's one of our best.” I thought, “By God. If we needed our
                    best, then we needed them out there.”</p>
                <p>That was the kind of attitude I got from the lower level of the Department, and I
                    didn't do too well by Bill Bundy, either. Because although he and I were good
                    friends, I said something to the effect, “Please don't put out any casualty
                    figures until you've check them with me.” This was when we were losing some of
                    our people.</p>
                <p>And I got back something about, “I'm running the Bureau for Asian Affairs.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was the problem? The figures you felt weren't
                        correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Well, they needed to be vetted, yes. You know, the first figures you get
                    are always wrong. They've got to be checked. That's the way the body count is
                    always wrong. I mean, for instance, the My Lai massacre, so called, happened
                    when I was up in I Corps, and people have asked me time and again, “What did you
                    know about My Lai?” I didn't know a damn thing about My Lai, except that the
                    body count was particularly high that day. Who were they?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Villages. This is a slaughter essentially of civilians by
                        a platoon of American soldiers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: But we had a very good working relationship as far as I Corps was
                    concerned. Not only the commander but the armored commander was a good guy, too.
                    And the CIA chap and the USIA people were all very good.</p>
                <p>I had some help in that respect from the people in Saigon. Barry Zorthian, for
                    example, with USIA, he was a good friend of mine, and he said, “Whatever you
                    want, I'll back you up,” that type of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had this team together, but what would they do? How
                        does one go about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>KOREN: Well, first of all you'd visit as much as possible the various centers of
                    population and see for yourself whether ARVN was lacking, or the Army or the
                    Marines were overstepping their bounds, or anything like that. And then we set
                    up a—what the hell did we call it? I can't remember the name of the thing, but a
                    working setup whereby all the elements, the psychological and, you know, what
                    you'd expect the USIA to do and the CIA to do, the intelligence and the
                    psychological effort, we coordinated all those together. In effect, we would
                    say, “That's your problem, that's your problem,” and they'd go to it. I had some
                    perfectly fine gents working for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Phoenix Program in—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: That's what I'm talking about, the Phoenix Program. That was begun in I
                    Corps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Part of this was a way of, in polite terms, eliminating
                        the professional cadre of the Viet Cong.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: It was exposing them, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Exposing them. How did this work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: How did it work?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. How did it work? I mean, what would we do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Well, we would get the villagers and the Chinese to finger the people, and
                    we worked on a one-to-one basis, really. See, I was lucky in some respects. The
                    people I had who spoke Vietnamese, learned Vietnamese, one Marine lieutenant
                    colonel spoke very good Vietnamese. He was invaluable in that respect, and he
                    was the advisor to the mayor of Da Nang. That gave him a whole lot of—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's say some of the villagers would say, “So and so is
                        part of the Viet Cong cadre.” What would we do? Did we send in hit squads?
                        Did we arrest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: No. We would tell the ARVN and they would get rid of them. It was usually
                    a matter of killing them off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: yes. So basically we would inform the ARVN.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>KOREN: We would inform the ARVN, and sometimes we would do it ourselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say “do it ourselves,” with who? Our military or
                        the CIA or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: CIA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you ever worried about this being sort of a rogue
                        elephant that might get out of control or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: No, because I trusted the CIA type. I think that's the main reason.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the ARVN performing up where you were? What was
                        your evaluation of the ARVN out in the field?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: It was better led from the top.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Lam had a reputation of being pretty corrupt.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Well, if he did, I'm sure he does. There's no Vietnamese that isn't
                    somewhat tinged. But he was a good commander and he worked well with the Marine
                    commander.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would he go out in the field, Lam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Oh, yes, he did. Not as much as the Marines would like, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That wasn't the style. The Marine Corps had their own
                        particular brand of pacification, where they had small teams with a medic
                        and this type of thing. There you were in the field. Were you seeing a
                        difference between them and, say, an, American Army unit doing it? Or was
                        this show more than real?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: The Marine—what the hell do they call them? Combined Action
                    Platoon.(CAP)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Pacification teams or something? They have a fancy
                        term.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>KOREN: They were very good and very effective. And sometimes they were overrun
                    because the ARVN didn't perform, so all wasn't sweetness and light in I Corps by
                    any means. There was a drawback, no question about that. But those Marine teams
                    were very good and very dedicated and very brave, because they were out in the
                    various little towns.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very much exposed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Very much exposed and they did it. I felt, that the Marines had a group
                    because it's very easy to say the Marines. There was only one division. I mean,
                    well, there was more than one division, but there was one command. They were all
                    Marines, and so the Marines, I think, did a better job and a more
                    centrally-controlled job than any of the American divisions did. I became a very
                    strong advocate of the Marine effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, something that struck me in my time in Vietnam,
                        which was '69 to '70, was how quickly leadership was turned over,
                        particularly at the officer level. Six months in the field and six months
                        out, and one had the feeling that at least the Army was turning this into
                        more of a training exercise rather than putting their best troops forward
                        and giving it all out. Did you have this feeling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: To a certain extent, but I think that was more the Army than it was the
                    Marine Corps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Didn't you have an airborne division?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Oh, yes, we had an airborne. One Hundred and First were there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find the Army, did they have a feel for the type
                        of war, or again do you think they were suffering from the same problem all
                        of us had of not really knowing how to fight this war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: I think they suffered from the same uncertainty, the same tentativeness,
                    without some positive direction that the Marines were able to do from
                    their—because they say the Marines—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Pacific action teams, or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: The Marines had a special term for it. It's just gone out of my head.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that's all right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: I think it was easier for the Marines to do than, say, the Army. That
                    means a whole lot of varying divisions around the Army is one thing, but you
                    can't say that the MACV commander, he had to delegate to the various division
                    commanders and the corps commanders. But the Marines were all by themselves.
                    They had just one. (?)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Enlarged division.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Yes, enlarged division, but very much of a one area they knew they were
                    responsible for.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much slopping? I mean, was there rivalry between
                        the four corps as far as people doing the same job you were doing, trying to
                        say we're doing better than you are, or passing information back and
                        forth?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Despite the common efforts, I don't think there was a cohesion between the
                    four corps people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So really you were each sort of operating within your
                        area. I mean, they were different, a different mix, but you didn't feel that
                        this was—I mean, you felt you could try anything. You weren't getting all
                        sorts of, “Now do this and do that.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: I think it was completely a matter of self-starting and
                    self-initiative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Weren't the Korean Marines up in your area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember a friend of mine saying they were a tough bunch
                        but it was hard to get them going, because they were under orders not to
                        take casualties and so they were more passive. They watched out for their
                        own protection, but really did play much of a passive role.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Perfectly true, I think. Their perimeter defense was excellent, but they
                    didn't strike out, you know, just as the Philippine contingent was very
                    constrained and so was the Thais.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KOREN: More symbolic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: More symbolic. Were you bothered much by the Press Corps?
                        Bothered is the wrong term, but I mean, did the Press Corps play much of a
                        role in your area, or were they pretty much down?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Pretty much down in Saigon. They would come up to I Corps because they had
                    the Press Corps. The most famous group was when Joe Alsop and—who was that
                    guy—they came up to I Corps. Everybody came up to I Corps because it was the DMZ
                    type of operation. But from the point of view of bother, no, I don't think you
                    could say they bothered us. The only real bother we had was Teddy Kennedy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what happened with Teddy Kennedy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Oh, that bastard. I disliked him from the word “go.” But he came up and,
                    of course, I was the designated—Q: Senior civilian?</p>
                <p>KOREN: I can't remember who it was. Bob Cushman, I guess, was the Marine
                    commander at that time, and in effect he just washed his hands of him and said,
                    “It's all yours.” So I had him in my house and quarters, and he, in effect,
                    said, “I want to see casualties and I want to see the burn casualties and napalm
                    casualties and all.” Well, I had this perfectly wonderful little feisty doctor
                    who was one of the group that came over and volunteered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. There were a whole series of volunteer doctors who
                        came over to treat civilian casualties.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: He said, “If he wants to see casualties, give him to me.” And I said,
                    “Okay.” So we arranged that he would go to the civilian hospital. Well, you've
                    been to the civilian hospitals in Vietnam. You know they're no place for a weak
                    stomach, and I must say, a couple of times, too, my stomach began. And various
                    incredible, something I suspect that Kennedy had never seen in his life before,
                    these terrible burn patients and family all clustered around trying to take care
                    of them and the bloody mattresses and the whole sphere. And I must say Kennedy,
                    he looked a little pale around the gills, and he finally said he'd had
                    enough.</p>
                <p>But the thing that I remember distinctly was he asked the doctors, “Show me a
                    burn patient.”</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>The doctors said, “Senator, nobody can tell whether the burn is from napalm or
                    from a upset gasoline stove.”</p>
                <p>“Now you tell me what you think.”</p>
                <p>And he just gave it right back to him. He said, “That's absolutely impossible. A
                    burn is a burn, period.” And so that took care of that problem. Of course,
                    phosphors you can tell. So Kennedy finally gave up and said he'd seen all he had

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Another figure, I don't think he worked in your area, but
                        did you run across him at all, because he's become a man of some
                        controversy, John Paul Vann?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: John Paul Vann, sure. I knew him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is your evaluation of him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Well, he was unquestionably a controversial figure, and I'd say that John
                    Vann has some damned good ideas and I've confessed to trying to plagiarize some
                    of his ideas and some of his methods.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was working in II Corps.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: He was in II Corps, yes. I think I knew John before I even left Saigon.
                    But any rate, I think his problem was he was too much of a egotist. And I
                    wouldn't say he did everything from the point of view of “what can it do for
                    me,” but there was always a grain about him. I don't want to do him an injustice
                    by any means. I have not read that book.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's an interesting book, but I'm sure you'd find A Bright
                        and Shining Lie.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Who wrote it?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sheehan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Neil Sheehan. I knew Neil. He was a pretty good man, I think. I haven't
                    read his book.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you say you found some things that he was doing there
                        that you would borrow from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Oh, yes. I can't put my finger on them, but he had damn good ideas and he
                    had certain of methods I thought, “Boy, that's something I can work with,” that
                    type of thing. But he was a man I would say of lively imagination and complete
                    dedication. I liked John, but he was not a close friend of mine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you up in I Corps feel about the operation,
                        although you weren't in it, but, you know, there was an awful lot of
                        concern. I can recall back here in Washington as the Marine Corps held onto
                        Khe Sanh. Was there unease? Was there questioning? With your background,
                        both political and military, how did you feel about this thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Well, I must confess, I thought that Khe Sanh was similar to Dien Bien Phu
                    in some respect, because God knows, the VC were tunneling right up to the
                    parallel, so to speak, and we knew that. I remember talking to Bob Cushman, the
                    commander of the Marines at that time I was there.</p>
                <p>“You know, I think, Bob, we ought to get out of there.” That was just my feeling,
                    because I knew the way they operated, and all of a sudden we'd be faced with
                    “Well, here they are, right in front of us.” I don't know. That's the way it
                    pretty much came out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's still very controversial, because in one case we said
                        we brought a lot together so we could bomb the hell out of them, and they
                        did take quite a few casualties. But the other thing, we had lost mobility
                        and we ended up taking something which we abandoned later on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: I was just about to make a comparison with Khe Sanh and—the thought I had
                    went out of my mind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course our strategy at that time was how to get the
                        North Vietnamese Army to confront our troops so we could bring our superior
                        fire power, and this was felt to be “if they want to do it, we can go after
                        them that way.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: I know what I was trying to think of—drawing an analogy between that point
                    of view and the Tet Offensive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If we could talk about Tet, that would pretty well end
                        it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>KOREN: I know that they stopped the conventional wisdom, but I always felt, and I
                    said at the time, that I thought we took a hell of a beating in Tet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to say, I Corps was probably the hardest hit.
                        Hue fell. Do you feel that it is not only a political disaster, but also a
                        military one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Well, not entirely. It seemed to me that the fact that they were able to
                    do that without any warning at all meant to me that we didn't have the proper
                    tentacles out and according to.... psychologically, we took a hell of a
                    beating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Politically, of course, it was an absolute disaster. What
                        happened to you during Tet? Were you there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: No. I had a Marine steward and I said, “Let's get in the car and go down
                    and see what's going on.” And so we went downtown.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Da Nang?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Da Nang. Starting down at Feely Broad Street and all of a sudden there was
                    firing coming out, and I said, “The hell with this.” I've never seen a man turn
                    a wheel so fast in my life. [Laughter] He was a big, powerful guy, and we turned
                    the jeep and we turned in the street, it doesn't seem to me now much wider than
                    that, and we beat it to the other direction, because I didn't see any point in
                    being fired on.</p>
                <p>So we came back and the sky was lit up, of course, all around by the various
                    things. There was some fires that had been started that added to it and there
                    was constant shelling going on. So we decided the best thing to do was to stay
                    put, and we didn't crawl under the bed, but we put barricades up. We lugged all
                    the furniture we could and put it up, because I had a house and we barricaded
                    ourselves as much as we could and just got our weapons and just waited. We were
                    sure they were coming for us. They would sooner or later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Da Nang was relatively quickly taken over by our
                        forces.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hue was the . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>KOREN: Hue was something different. That's where Phil Manhard was. Did you ever
                    talk to him?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, but not on that but on his China experience. I'm
                        trying to get back to him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>One last question on Vietnam. What happened to the pacification effort after Tet
                    that you saw in the immediate aftermath of the pacification? Was this in a way
                    helped because of the destruction of the Viet Cong cadre, or was your apparatus
                    pretty well destroyed?</p>
                <p>KOREN: It was a considerable blow to the Phoenix Program, and psychologically it
                    was a hell of a blow to the whole operation, the whole pacification effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you left Vietnam in 1968, didn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about it when you left? How did you feel
                        where you were going? Because this is a time of some optimism, I think, on
                        the part of some.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: My feeling was that we were making some progress. I think that's the best
                    way I can describe it. Of course, from the point of view of I Corps, we had
                    maintained the borders pretty well so that I thought that would gradually spread
                    itself and spread its influence further down to other corps areas and give us
                    the thing that we needed as much as anything else was confidence and we needed
                    some accomplishments so we could say, “Oh, boy. We're on the right track. Let's
                    keep going.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mr. Ambassador, we're under instructions from your wife to
                        wind this up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: I'm sorry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, this has been fine. We covered the main points. You
                        were an inspector for a period of time, and you retired when? In what
                        year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: '71.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '71. Well, we'll leave the inspection period out. The last
                        question I try to ask of everybody, if somebody comes to you today, a young
                        person, and says, “Mr. Ambassador, what about the Foreign Service as a
                        career?” How would you reply to that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: I would urge them to take it if they have the necessary qualifications.
                    And the qualifications, I would say, is intelligence and experience and ability
                    to take charge of something and see it through to the end. In other words, a
                    take-charge mentality. I would urge them to do that, but I would not try to
                    glamorize it in any respect. I would say, “This is tough.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had what one could call a rather tough career. I mean,
                        difficult assignments.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: Well, it was fun. But I would have no hesitancy in saying to the
                    individual, “Go to it,” but it's not easy. First of all, the mental side is very
                    exacting. I didn't find it that way. I mean, not that I'm brainy and all, but I
                    didn't have to take the written exam, being in Manpower. And all the questions
                    that I would have in my mind is “Is the individual”—</p>
                <p>MRS. KOREN: He won't be able to talk for a day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know it. Well, we're just winding this up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOREN: I would say that you can't gauge the individual that's just out of
                    college, say, or thinking of going into college, whether they have what I
                    consider the managerial talents and the leadership talents. The military talks
                    about leadership all the time, but it's the same thing with the Foreign Service.
                    As you know, the man in charge is the leader, whether he's the political
                    counselor or whatever it happens to be.</p>
                <p>That is something that's an intangible that you don't know very often until it's
                    brought out. It's tested. You can't really test it. You can write, “How would
                    you handle such and such a situation?” But the main thing is the ability to
                    react in the proper way at the proper time and the necessary time and marshal
                    everything together, because the old story, “You don't penetrate armor by just
                    throwing rocks at it.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Mr. Ambassador, I want to thank you very much, and I
                        really appreciate this.</hi>
