                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the third of December, 2004. This is done with
                        Bernard F. Shinkman, S-H-I-N-K-M-A-N. Done on behalf of the Association for
                        Diplomatic Studies and Training. And I regret to say that we have already
                        put in about a half hour of discussion and we discovered it wasn't
                        recording. So we'll start again. Do it for a short period and then we'll
                        pick this up another time. You go by the name of Buck, B-U-C-K.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: I do indeed. I can tell you there's an anecdote behind that. Always
                    full of anecdotes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Alright.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: I was named Bernard Francis Shinkman, III, named after my uncle and my
                    great grandfather who came over from Eastern Europe in the 1840s. And for
                    reasons that I don't know, my unclwho I love very muchis nickname was Bunny,
                    B-U-N-N-Y. Not an unknown nickname, but a pretty rare nickname, particularly for
                    a boy.</p>
                <p>In 1960 my parents felt - as I mentioned in the last half hour - that I was being
                    lazy at Walter Johnson Senior High School and decided to ship me off to boarding
                    school outside of Boston. And we sat around the dinner table at Sunday dinner
                    one Sunday, with my two older brothers and me and my parents, and decided that
                    it was evident that going off to boarding school at the age of 16 as the new
                    kid, with all these other kids who had been there forever, was going to be hard
                    enough. Carrying with you the baggage of a nickname like Bunny was going to make
                    it suicidal. So we thought, well, what other nickname to choose? And we came up
                    as a matter of discussion with Buck. And I can't remember who came up with it.
                    And so we adopted it that day at lunch, and I've been called Buck since
                    1960.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it was a rational choice.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: It was a rational choice. It wasn't something involved. It wasn't
                    something cute that I said when I was in my crib at night. It was just a
                    rational choice to help me get through boarding school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you tell me first about the name Shinkman and then
                        where your father's family came from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Yes indeed. They came from a part of East Germany, or Eastern Europe,
                    I'm not absolutely sure where it is. I have the name of the town, I think it was
                    Grifswald, which is somewhere perhaps in what was Eastern Germany or in
                    Poland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But basically a Germanic background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: A Germanic background, absolutely. And came to the United States in the
                    1840s. I'm not sure if it was for political or for religious freedom or whether
                    it was for economic opportunity, but I suspect all three of those together.
                    There was, as we discussed earlier, a wave of immigration coming from that part
                    of the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Known as the 48-ers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: The 48-ers. The Carl Schurz expeditions. And then my great grandfather
                    came as part of those. Went straight to Grand Rapids, Michigan. Settled there.
                    And that's where the family lived and where my father was raised until he moved
                    to New York.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did your father go to University?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: He went to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. And graduated from
                    there in I think 1919 or 1920. The family, as I mentioned earlier, when we lived
                    in Austria at one stagand we'll get to thamy mother did a lot of research on the
                    family name. We have a copy of the family crest that was brought over with my
                    great grandfather. And it includes on it a mail boot from a suit of armor. And
                    the records show that the family was established by a knight during the
                    Crusades.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Crusades would be about 1000, 1100.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: 1000, 1100. Anyway, this guy lost his leg and so therefore was called,
                    the German word for thigh I believe is schinken, like ham. And he was
                    Schinkelmann. And that devolved, or evolved into Schinkmann. One branch went
                    east into Russia and became Tshinkman, with a “T” in front of it. We have a
                    travel document from that member of the family. But Schinkelman became
                    Schinkmann and then the second “n” in “mann” was dropped and the “c” between the
                    “S” and the “h” was dropped.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you want to talk a little bit about your father's early
                        career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Absolutely. He graduated from the University of Michigan, wanted to go
                    to law school. He wrote for the daily school newspaper at the University of
                    Michigan and enjoyed that work so much that I think perhaps his grades suffered.
                    And he actually graduated a semester late. Mom always said it was just because
                    he loved writing for the newspaper and did that more than cracking the books,
                    which he should have done. He then went off to law school. Did that for one
                    semester. Thought it was absolutely dreadful. Left. Worked in a department store
                    in Grand Rapids. He had read Peter Whiffle, the novel by Carl Van Vechten, which
                    had absolutely made him fall in love at a distance with France. So he worked for
                    a year to save enough money to buy a round trip ticket on the first student
                    package tour to Europe, which was going steerage clasand it really was called
                    that I believon an ocean liner called the Saxonia. And he went over.</p>
                <p>Stayed for a year in Paris, living on the Left Bank. And loved it so much that
                    early on in his time there he started looking for a job. Couldn't find a job.
                    His French wasn't that good, of course, at first. He had excellent German but
                    did not have that good French. Came up to that one year anniversary when he had
                    to ship back to the U.S. and sold his return ticket to another student in order
                    to give him the money to live there a little longer to try and find a job. And
                    in that period managed to find a job working for the Chicago Tribune. And went
                    on to spend the next five or six years living in Paris and in London working on
                    Fleet Street in what's now the Reuters' BuildinI think it may have even been the
                    Reuters' Building theworking for the Chicago Tribune bureau. And ended up I
                    believe as bureau chief in Paris or in London, I'm not sure which.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On your mother's side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Mother's side, I do know because I read some of the history just in the
                    last month. There's a new book by a cousin of mine, Tony Benn, who was a
                    prominent British politician for many years. My great, great grandfather was a
                    Congregationalist minister in the north of England. His son, John Williams
                    Benthe family name is Benn, B-E-N-started a small trade publication, I think it
                    was for the furniture industry, called the Cabinet Maker. And from that magazine
                    built up a small publishing company. And he was knighted for his work on
                    exports, enabling or facilitating export of British products.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>And so his son, my grandfather, Sir Ernest Benn, took over the company and really
                    grew it into quite a large substantial company with its own building on Fleet
                    Street. It was always told to me that it was the British equivalent of
                    McGraw-Hill. It was about that size, about that complexion, doing business
                    magazines, trade publications, reference books, directories, that sort of stuff.
                    So my grandfather built it into quite a large company. His son, my uncle
                    Glanvill became chairman and then in the early to mid 1980s it was bought by a
                    larger British company called Exchange Telegraph, which was in its own time then
                    bought by a larger British company called, I think, United Newspapers. And I
                    think that's who now owns the publications. There were forty or fifty magazines
                    that they published. Whether it still exists as Benn Brothers, I don't know, or
                    whether it is just the magazines that go on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your mother?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: So my mother grew up in that family. She had gone to Rhodean, which was
                    clearly then and I think still now the pre-eminent young women's schoojunior
                    college I guess you would call ion the south coast of England. Sussex I think it
                    is. She then did studies at the Sorbonne. She got what I think we would call an
                    Associates degree. She then did charitable work in London. My grandfather had
                    opened a youth hostel in the poor section of London's East End and mom did
                    charitable work there. And then met my father.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were mentioning how your mother and father met?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: They had met becausand this is getting very arcanwhen my dad went over
                    to Europe the first time, on the Saxonia, of course they were all packed into
                    cabins on the lower decks of the ship. There were four of them in the cabin. And
                    during the four or five days it took to cross the Atlantic, the students of
                    course often became fast friends. One of dad's friends was the scion of a
                    department store family, I believe out of Cincinnati, but I'm not sure about
                    that. Durand Smith. And he had studied at Cambridge. And one of my mother's
                    older brotherGlanvill, whom I mentioned beforalso studied at Cambridge. And
                    Glanvill and Durand Smith became friends. So when my father some years later
                    moved from Paris to London, he and Durand Smith got an apartment togethe“digs”
                    as you would call iin Cliffords' Inn, just off of Fleet Street.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>And Durand Smith, my father's flatmate, knew Glanvill Benn and there was some big
                    holiday party, Christmas party, whatever, at the Benn family residence in
                    Surrey, in the countryside outside of London. Durand Smith was invited by his
                    good friend from Cambridge, Glanvill Benn, to go to the party. And Glanvill also
                    said, “why don't you bring your flatmate?” So my dad went along, met Glanvill's
                    younger sister, who was my mom, and they formed a romantic attachment, which
                    developeDad never moved quickly in these thingover the course of ten years. They
                    had met in about 1925 and he proposed to her in 1935 by cablegram. I don't know
                    what the state of trans-Atlantic telephones was in 1935, but it wasn't great.
                    And he sent her a telegram, said “will you marry me?” in better words than that.
                    And she said “yes.” And they were married in 1935 outside London in the
                    countryside in Surrey southeast of London and then moved directly back New York
                    City where dad was living at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And your father was working in New York City for the
                        Tribune still?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: No, he had left the Tribune when he came back and was working in
                    broadcast journalism. He was doing news reporting and he was also a theater
                    critic. Had a lifelong love of the theater. And I can't remember the station.
                    I'm tempted to think WOR, but I'm not absolutely sure about that. But that's
                    what he was doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened during the war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: They got married in 35 and were living in New York at that time. Dad
                    being older, he wasn't called into service in the Second World War. And he
                    continued to work in New York. And then in 1942 he was asked to come to
                    Washington. As I mentioned earlier, he was trilingual with English, French and
                    German. And he was asked to come and run what I believe was called the Foreign
                    Broadcast Intelligence Service, now known as the Foreign Broadcast Information
                    Service, or FBIS. And he would listen to German broadcastnot classified military
                    transmissions, but public broadcastand then translate them and interpret them
                    for the government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So then, in your earliest memories, your father had a
                        foreign service stance, didn't he?</hi>
                </p>

                <p>SHINKMAN: He did indeed. He came down from New York to Washington in 42. They had
                    a tiny apartment at that stage in Manhattan. They couldn't afford to give up the
                    lease on the apartment. So mom and my two older brotherI wasn't born at the
                    timstayed in Manhattan and dad came down and stayed in a rooming house in
                    Washington and did war work through to the end of the war. He then worked in
                    local broadcasting in the Washington area until in 1951 he was asked by a good
                    friend, Walter Robertone of the great names in USIA's historif dad would go to
                    Vienna to be the press spokesman at the American legation. Austria was an
                    occupied country. Vienna was an occupied city. So of course we didn't have an
                    embassy because there was no government to have an embassy to. So we had what
                    was called a legation. And dad was press spokesman at the American legation in
                    Vienna. And of course we went with him.</p>
                <p>In those daya wonderful anecdotthe U.S. Government sent you abroad properly if
                    you were in the Foreign Service. And we went first class, the five of us, my two
                    older brothers and me and my mom and dad. I think we went over on the SS America
                    of the United States, and came back on the SS Constitution of the American
                    Export Lines. Salvador Dali was in first class with us also. Not that we got to
                    know Salvador well, but my brother has a treasured signature of his on the
                    dinner menu one night.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was on the United States and we came first class with
                        the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. Really, we weren't all mixing and mingling,
                        but at the same time . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: But it was the appropriate way for diplomats representing the greatest
                    country on earth to travel. And I think we still should travel first class by
                    ship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned one little thing that was sort of
                        interesting about your mother and father while you were in Austria, about
                        your brother and his bike experience.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Well, Dad's status was interesting. At that stagI believe it doesn't
                    still existhere was a category of foreign service officer called “foreign
                    service limited reserve.” And he came on with a clear understanding that he was
                    being brought on to do a specific job. He was a foreign service officer, but he
                    was a reservist, sort of like you have army reservists, which I was for twenty
                    plus years. So he was a foreign service officer just for three years.</p>
                <p>The American military ran the school system for military dependents in Vienna.
                    And most of the American diplomatic community went to those schools. But my
                    brother was a very bright guy. At this stage, this would be 1951, he was fifteen
                    and needed to be getting ready for college. And mom and dad thought that the
                    academic standards at the American dependents school were not perhaps as
                    rigorous as they would have liked. So, since he knew French, they sent him to
                    the Lyc�e Fran�ais in Vienna. And he had two very good years there, which
                    ultimately sent him off to Harvard.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>But one interesting anecdote which I was recalling earlier is that, as I say, it
                    was a very tense time in Vienna. And it really was Harry Lime and the Third Man,
                    all that sort of thing. I was blissfully unaware of all that being 8, 9 years
                    old. But listening to my mom and dad years later after we came back, it really
                    was a pretty tense place. For my brother, of course, all his friends were other
                    students at the French Lyc�e. And the French traveled much more easily into the
                    Soviet zone of Austria and of Vienna than did Americans, because it was a pretty
                    chilly time in relations. So when Paul's classmates would go off on bicycle
                    trips into the Russian Zone, he'd always ask to go along and it was very hard
                    for mom and dad to say “no, you can't go with . . .”. You know, all parents
                    resist “everyone's going” plea that to a certain extent, but in this case it
                    just wasn't possible. So he'd go off. The border between the French Zone and the
                    Russian Zone wasn't nearly as tightly controlled as between the American Zone
                    and the Russian Zone. So the kids would just be waved through. And Paul would go
                    through as just one of a bunch of French kids. And mom and dad would sit there
                    with their hearts in their mouths, worrying that he was going to be discovered
                    anwithout being melodramatiliterally disappear and be gone, until he came back
                    three hours later and was safely back in the French, British or American Zones
                    and they would sort of collapse. Again, all this I was blissfully unaware of,
                    playing in the back garden or whatever. But it was a tense time for them.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: If that's all right.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 8th of December 2004. When you came back from
                        Vienna, whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: We moved back into our house off Bradley Boulevard in Bethesda. I had
                    done third and fourth grade in Austria. I'm trying to think whether I mentioned
                    the British school in Austria. Did I mention that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think we did, but tell us a little more . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Well I'll mention this because it's sort of funny. We moved down to
                    Graz for my dad to open the Amerika Haus in Graz. Graz was in the British Zone
                    in Austria, and so the only schooling for me was a tiny little British army
                    dependents school of about twenty or thirty students in all grades from
                    kindergarten through junior high school, I think. It was run by a rather fierce
                    woman, Ms. Connelly. And two anecdotes from that time stick in my mind.</p>
                <p>One is that caning was very much in fashion in those days. And I came shockingly
                    close to being caned one day for playing some relatively innocent game, not
                    paying attention in class, or something like that. Of course they had to keep
                    discipline because it was in a big old house. It wasn't a school. And so the
                    kids had to pay attention to their studies. But I was goofing around a little
                    bit with some other kid and he got caned and I didn't because I was brand new in
                    the school and the headmistress sort of cut me a bit of slack. But it was as
                    close as I came to the pretty foul practice of caning students.</p>
                <p>The other thing was that on some day that was a holiday in the U.S. and I don't
                    know what it would have been, maybe Memorial Day or somethinat lunchtime we all
                    gathered together for lunch. Ms. Connelly came out with this dish. As I
                    mentioned earlier, I think my nickname in those days was Bunny. And she
                    announced to the dining room, “Bunny, you'll recognize this very American dish
                    although none of the other students would.” And so I looked at this thing. And
                    it was in a flat sort of pie plate. It was maybe three eighths of an inch high.
                    Sort of tan coating on something that was vaguely sort of beige underneath it.
                    And I had to admit, “Sorry Ms. Connelly, I don't know what it is.” Well of
                    course, it was lemon meringue pie. About as far as from anything you or I would
                    ever call lemon meringue pie, but anyway, it was a nice gesture on her part to
                    try and do something American on this holiday.</p>
                <p>So we come back home from Austria. We sailed back First Class courtesy of the
                    U.S. Government, as diplomats should be able to travel in keeping with our
                    stature in the world. We moved back into our house off Bradley Boulevard in
                    Bethesda. I went to fifth and sixth grades at Bradley Elementary, which is not
                    called that anymore. I think it's still a school. It may be called Bradley Hills
                    Elementary. I went from there to junior high school, which was then seventh,
                    eighth and ninth grade, at North Bethesda Junior High School, the first three
                    years that it was open. It opened when I went there for the seventh grade. And
                    then I went on to Walter Johnson Senior High School out in Rockville. Up until
                    that time there had only been BCBethesda Chevy Chase High Schooserving Bethesda,
                    but we were marginally closer to Rockville, so when Walter Johnson opened in the
                    fall of 1958 I went there for two years. And then my parents decided I was being
                    lazy in school and if I was going to get into a good college I needed to work
                    harder. So they sent me off to prep school at Saint Mark's School in
                    Southborough, Massachusetts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What years were you in Montgomery County?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: We came back from Austria in 1953 and I went off to boarding school in
                    1960.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a time when Maryland was a southern state and was
                        hit by the civil rights thing and all of that. How did that affect you
                        all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Well, I was fairly young to notice that sort of thing. My lasting
                    impression coming back from Vienna was that I thought I'd had a really
                    interesting experience, my family's very international background. And I thought
                    naturally all of the friends I made in the neighborhood would be interested in
                    this fascinating thing. Well of course, they could not have been less
                    interested. All they wanted to know was who was on the Mickey Mouse Club that
                    afternoon, that sort of thing. So I saved my “interesting” experience for other
                    times and didn't get a lot of mileage out of it.</p>
                <p>In terms of things like the period that America was going though, I didn't have
                    much impression of that as a child that age. I remember we used to go to Glen
                    Echo to the amusement part there regularly, because of the swimming at the
                    Crystal Pool, I think it was called. And then at one stage we stopped as I
                    remember my mother saying that there was an outbreak of polio.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well the vaccine came out about 55.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: So it would have been around that time. Around that same time Glen Echo
                    was integrated, but my parents would not have stopped going someplace because it
                    was integrated. It just wasn't a big deal.</p>
                <p>I also remember something I mentioned earlier perhaps, that I learned years
                    later. When my parents moved into our neighborhood in Woodhaven, in 1944 or 45,
                    there was a clause in the contract that said “you will not sell your house to a
                    Jew.” Well of course my parents said “that's crazy. We're not going to sign
                    anything like that.” My father grew up a Roman Catholic but was converted to the
                    Anglican church by my mother and we've been stout Episcopalians for years. Of
                    course that exclusionary clause was crossed out of the contract and my parents
                    did buy the house. But it was one of those odd little things that used to
                    happen, but had stopped happening by the parents bought their house.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about at Walter Johnson? Did that get hit by
                        integration?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Not that I noticed. We had some black students there. The ones I
                    remember more than the blacks were a family of American Indians. And I thought
                    they were the most interesting people. I recall a big massive guy who looked
                    like what you and I might consider stereotypical; tall broad features in his
                    face. Nice, nice guy. There were some blacks at WJ, but it wasn't a big
                    issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were in high school, before we go to prep

                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Math and English were the two subjects that I was fondest of. I was
                    never a great scholar. Well, my wife always says I say that and she insists it's
                    not true. But, yes, math and English were my favorites. I was President of the
                    Math Club at Walter Johnson at one stage. Played some chess and pastimes like
                    that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: I don't think so. We followed events I suppose in the UK fairly closely
                    because my mother had been born British. And discussed current events around the
                    dinner table because dad was a newspaperman. But nothing that really jumps off
                    the page at me.</p>

                    that sort of stuff.</p>

                <p>SHINKMAN: Small New England prep school. There is a group of about six of them
                    that are known collectively apparently as Saint Grottlesex, which are Saint
                    Paul's, Saint Mark's, Middlesex, Groton, two others...</p>

                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Well Andover is a lot bigger. These are small schools. I think the
                    total student body for six grades was 240. No I think it was even smaller than
                    that. Somewhere around those numbers. A couple hundred students for secondary
                    school, everything above elementary school. So it was a small school. It was
                    just a boys school at that stage. Most of the kids were from the Northeastern
                    United States. My first year there I roomed with a Mexican boy who came from a
                    well-to-do Mexican family. I think we had an exchange student from Germany. But
                    most of them were just kids from families in New England.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And how did you find the education there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Well it was a first rate education. It was markedly different. Very
                    small classes. You know, five, six, seven students, this sort of stuff.
                    Excellent teaching staff. And I think I enjoyed the procedure. Very much the
                    world of J.D. Salinger's Holden Caulfield.</p>
                <p>A lot of the kids had been there of course for their whole six years of secondary
                    school. So they had formed long-term alliances. But I remember feeling very
                    privileged that I was able to go there. I remember one particular dait's funny
                    the things that stick in your minbut I was manager of the football team. St.
                    Mark's is in Southborough, a spectacular setting in rural Massachusetts, a
                    really beautiful setting, among streams and ponds. Very Walden and that sort of
                    geography. The school has beautiful buildings, and is about 150 years old. I can
                    remember one day it struck me, “you really are very, very lucky to be in this
                    idyllic setting getting such a great education.” That was kind of an interesting
                    stage. I was probably 17 at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you pointed towards in '62 when you got
                        out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Well, I think again that math and English were the subjects that most
                    interested me. And so when I went to Dartmouth, I had the intention of majoring
                    in math. Dartmouth at that stage was on a trimester system, and I was a math
                    major for about two trimesters in my freshman year. You didn't have to declare
                    your major until, I think, the end of your sophomore year. It was a lenient
                    process. But I had math in mind and focused on math courses for maybe my first
                    two trimesters there. And quickly got into theoretical math which I did not
                    enjoy nearly as much as practical math. So I said, this is not for me. What's a
                    logical career move here? I thought, well, economics, that's something.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>So I did economics for a couple of trimesters and found that subject to be deadly
                    dull, as they say, the dismal science. And I found it dismal. So it seemed
                    sensible then to go into English because I had always enjoyed English, enjoyed
                    reading and writing. A very literary family. So I was an English major and
                    graduated from Dartmouth in English.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any particular area of English literature that you
                        particularly liked?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: No, I don't think so. Nothing that sticks in my mind. I just enjoyed
                    reading and studying. The thing I most enjoyed at Dartmouth - and again I may
                    have mentioned earlier that my dad always said that his studies at the
                    University of Michigan suffered because he enjoyed writing for the daily
                    newspaper there so much he probably devoted too much time to isimilarly at
                    Dartmouth I worked for the campus radio station, which was the only AM radio
                    station in the United States owned and operated by students. And I really,
                    really enjoyed that a lot. I did live programming either with music or news
                    reporting or whatever was needed. I really enjoyed that and probably spent too
                    much time up at the radio station and not enough time in my room hitting the
                    books or in the library.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go for recreation? I always think of
                        “Dartmouth is in town again. Run girls, run!”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Well I had a car. I had bought a car the Christmas of my freshman year.
                    No. You couldn't have car your freshman year at Dartmouth, I believe, so I think
                    it must have been the following summer. But there were other schools. Dartmouth
                    was a single sex school at that stage and so we would do road trips on the
                    weekends to Skidmore and to Smith and Holyoke and places like that. And of
                    course there were organized events. At places like Dartmouth, which is fairly
                    remote, they organize an awful lot of events on campus because they know there's
                    not a lot of other stuff to do around there. So we led a fairly active life. But
                    it is out in the wilds of New Hampshire. And again, a spectacular location. And
                    a very, very good education. First rate.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about world affairs while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Just thinking off the top of my head, of course Kennedy was
                    assassinated while I was there. I remember that. I remember where I was, as
                    everyone does. I was in the stacks at Baker Library at Dartmouth when someone
                    came through and I rushed over to the radio station to watch the reporting
                    coming in. Nelson Rockefeller came through. I remember going to one of his
                    campaign speeches. He and Happy came through because he was campaigning for what
                    would have been the '64 elections.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah. It would have been for '64.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: I remember that event. I had been reporting for the 1964 presidential
                    primary in a remote corner of New Hampshire. The big three networks each had a
                    different way of covering the national elections in all the tiny little hamlets
                    around New Hampshirand the way ABC did it was to hire college kids and pay them
                    25 dollars to wait there until the results came in and then phone them in to
                    ABC. I was assigneI've still got all my paperwork at homto some little hamlet
                    like Dixville Notch. And I went there and there were few enough voters that they
                    would do balloting and counting at midnight. It was voting day. They would all
                    come in, cast their votes and the whole thing would be done by 12:15 [AM] on
                    election day. Well, I got this place. It was very snowy. And one of the other
                    networkI can't remember which onhad been rather more clever about it and they
                    had hired as reporters the spouses of the town clerks. So when the results were
                    announcethere was of course one phone line in that buildinwho was going to get
                    use of that phone line? Was it going to be the smart-alecky college kid who'd
                    come in two hours before and was leaving and would never come back? Or was it
                    going to be Jed's wife, who we see every day down at the general store? So of
                    course Jed's wife got the phone and scooped ABC for whichever network she
                    represented. I did phone in the results. But I cannot remember what they were.
                    I've got it written down at home.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the time you were at Dartmouth, did the student
                        body get involved all in the civil rights movement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Certainly there was some of that. And it was a mixed student body. But
                    it was still pretty much largely people who look like you and me. There was a
                    small black community. There was a small group of students, both African
                    Americans and non-African Americans, who were involved in the civil rights
                    movement. But it wasn't a major presence, as I recall. There weren't many
                    protests.</p>
                <p>What I do recall is that I joined ROTC my freshman year. And every Wednesday
                    afternoothis is '62 to '6we would get in our uniforms and go out and drill on
                    the college green in the middle of Dartmouth there in Hanover. And then my
                    junior and senior year, '64-'65 and '65-'66, we started getting regular small,
                    but noticeable, protests each Wednesday. We'd be out there marching around. The
                    protesters wouldn't try and interfere with us, but there would be a line of
                    people with placards or something. It was polite. It wasn't violent. People
                    didn't throw things, call us baby killers, whatever, but there was that
                    presence. But this was a timas I say, I graduated in '6the war was still ramping
                    up then. It really didn't get hot until later that year and '67, '68 and '69,
                    when I went to Vietnam.</p>

                        in the era of deconstructionism. I mean if you are taking English you are
                        almost taking gender studies and looking at it and trying to come up with a
                        different angle. How were you studying English when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: I don't think those sorts of issues really had come up yet. Again, it
                    was a male college. That doesn't mean you wouldn't have gender studies. But it
                    wasn't a natural topic for discussion. I remember the academic environment being
                    pretty conventional, what a lot of people today would call the study of “dead
                    white males from western Europe”. I found that very pleasant and . . .</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the military in the offing when you graduated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Yes. I'd been in ROTC. My son once asked me what prompted me to go into
                    ROTC. My oldest brother had done ROTC at Harvard and graduated as a Second
                    Lieutenant. He was a medical researcher and after he got his graduate degree had
                    gone off and done a couple of years of research in whatever his chosen field
                    was, paid for by the Army. And I thought, well that sounds like a good way to
                    manage your life. So I went into ROTC and graduated and was commissioned a
                    Second Lieutenant the summer of 1966. I took that summer off, and traveled to
                    Europe to visit family and friends around the UK.</p>
                <p>In the fall I went on active duty. I was sent on a series of training courses,
                    Signal Officers Basic Course at Fort Gordon, Georgia, from September to November
                    of '66. And then a radio officers course at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, from
                    November '66 to March of '67. Then psychological operations officer's course at
                    Fort Bragg, North Carolina, from March until August '67. That school had just
                    opened. At that stage it was called the John F. Kennedy Center for Special
                    Warfare, and the Special Forces were at Fort Bragg. My course was not part of
                    the Special Forces, but there were many Special Forces officers who were there
                    in the Psy-ops Officers Course. And I graduated. While I was there, as an
                    additional duty, I ran a little local radio station for the base, for Fort
                    Bragg. And then I went off to Vietnam in the fall of '67.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: I was with the 54th Signal Battalion. I was a radio platoon leader and
                    assistant platoon leader. The 54th was in a city called Nha Trang, on the coast
                    of South Vietnam. There was a major headquarters there called First Field Forces
                    Vietnam, IFFV, and it had its own signal unit to support its needs, and that was
                    us, the 54th Signal Battalion.</p>
                <p>It was an interesting assignment. Of course, being in Vietnam was an experience
                    in itself. Since this was a very senior headquarters, we provided the
                    communications from headquarters to all the other major sub-headquarters, the
                    division headquarters around this area.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Yes. The II Corps area. So I had detachments of my radio platoon at the
                    headquarters of these various units all around II Corps, which was wonderful
                    because it enabled me to travel to all those places. So I actually saw quite a
                    bit of South Vietnam, which I found fascinating.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Always full of anecdotes, the family says. I was actually duty officer
                    that night. The IFFV headquarters were in a big hotel on the coast. And I can
                    remember that night I was aof coursthe headquarters, in the building. And at
                    midnight I went up on the roof - it was maybe a four story building or something
                    like thajust to look out over the city of Nha Trang, which is quite a large
                    city.</p>
                <p>And I always remembered two things about it. One is that for the Vietnamese, like
                    many countries, one way to celebrate a holiday is to have a weapon and shoot it
                    into the air. And I can remember seeing lots of tracer bullets shooting up into
                    the air at midnight as Tet started. And then the tracers seemed to stop going
                    up. And the angle of fire seemed to become more horizontal. And that started the
                    Tet offensive.</p>
                <p>My role as duty officealthough it may initially sound like it was very
                    challenginsimply meant that, since this was obviously such a big event, I just
                    called everybody and everybody came in, from the corps commander on down. So I
                    basically sat there and watched all these people. But it was a somewhat
                    hair-raising event.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened in Nha Trang?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Well they didn't come all the way into the city. But there was a lot of
                    firing, lot of fighting, on the outskirts of the city. Nha Trang being a corps
                    headquarters city, was pretty well defended. So as I recall, there wasn't a lot
                    of hand-to-hand, house-to-house, fighting in the streets of Nha Trang. It was
                    pretty much out on the outskirts. And there was a big airbase there also, which
                    again was well defended.</p>

                        officers talking about what we were doing in Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: I think it's a good question. And I think about it fairly often. But
                    again, when you are in the middle of it, whether it's because it was the time it
                    wa'67, '68 - or whether its because of where we were in Vietnawe weren't out
                    walking through rice paddies with water up to our armpits holding our rifles
                    over our heads, it wasn't that kind of war in our locatiowe didn't spend a lot
                    of time agonizing over why we were there and what was going on. If you were in
                    the army, the army said “go to place X,” you went to place X and you did your
                    job. There wasn't a lot of discussion. I think we were aware of the protests
                    back in the states. But again it was '68 when those were more protests. As
                    always, there were people who were going to be disgruntled about being there,
                    but not for political reasons.</p>
                <p>But one of the great things about being in the Signal Corps is that you are
                    operating electrical equipment that always must be kept at an even temperature.
                    So whether you are in military bunkers or huts on the backs of deuce-and-a-half
                    trucks, they are going to be air conditioned. And where you've got the power to
                    run an air conditioner, you can run a little Sanyo electric refrigerator. So I
                    wouldn't say life was cushwe were in the middle of a war zonbut as I said we
                    were not out wading through rice paddies with our rifles over our heads. So
                    there wasn't a lot of disgruntlement on that score.</p>
                <p>There was some drug usage. I always wondered whether I was aware of it at the
                    time as much as I am in retrospect. But nothing traumatic. I think a few of the
                    troops in my unit probably smoked pot from time to time on the night shift. But
                    it wasn't anything rampant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the units up in the highlands and other places?
                        How did they fair during the Tet offensive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Well I'm not sure. I haven't talked to them that much. My units, my
                    detachments, were all at major headquarters. They were all at division
                    headquarters. At the headquarters of various divisions in the corps area. So
                    again, they were in well defended situations. The people up in Pleiku and An Khe
                    lived in places with sandbagwell we all lived in places with sandbags all around
                    thebut faced a more real threat from live fire and from grenades than we did
                    down in Nha Trang. But as you know as well as I do, there wasn't a front line in
                    Vietnam. The war was everywhere. So you were open to that sort of attack
                    anywhere. But again, given that it was a war zone, and a hot war zone, our
                    situation was better than it was for a lot of infantry soldiers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get at all involved with AFRTS?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Well I have another armed forces anecdote. AFRTS had a little
                    retransmitter on the roof of the hotethe same place that I mentioned from which
                    I watched the Tet offensive. And because we were the radio platoon for military
                    communications, that AFRTS retransmitter also came under our purview. It was not
                    a broadcast studio or anything. It was just a retransmitter. It received a
                    signal and rebroadcast it around the Nha Trang area. And one nighnot the Tet
                    offensivI remember we were having trouble with our telecommunications, our
                    teletype machines, connecting with one of our locations. And it became clear
                    that interference was coming from this AFRTS retransmitter. So I turned it off.
                    Well the next morning I got reamed out by my commanding officer who said I had
                    my priorities all wrong because I had tried tin my minmaintain military
                    communications by canceling something that I thought was very good for the
                    troops but reallin terms of the war efforwas marginal. He thought that the bad
                    publicity from cutting off AFRTS was not something I should have taken so
                    lightly. But that was my only connection with AFRTS. I never met Adrian Cronauer
                    or any of those people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in '68. Was that the end of your tour?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Yes. I was there almost exactly a year. A week short of a year,
                    something like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what happened next?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: I came back to the States. While I was in Vietnam, I had been thinking
                    for the previous year about what I wanted to do. And so I got off of active
                    duty. I had no intention of staying on active duty. And through family
                    connections with a publishing company on Fleet Street, I was offered a job on
                    Fleet Street. And I thought, gee, those times I've been to the UK before I
                    really liked it. And probably not least because my father had done a similar
                    thing, I though, great, I'll go to the UK for a year.</p>
                <p>So I was offered a job for just one year at a publishing house on Fleet Street,
                    and went over in October in '68 with the intention of staying just one year and
                    coming back to the States. And I just enjoyed living in London so much, I ended
                    up staying there for eight years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about significant others?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: While I was there, we got very early models of word processing
                    equipment, made by IBM. They were called “mag card readers.” They use magnetic
                    cards (four by eight or something?), you stick them in a machine and it will
                    make a copy of something you have typed and then type it back out for you. And
                    so the company acquired lots of this equipment and at that stage IBI guess they
                    do it today, towhen a company placed a major order for their equipment, they
                    would send IBM staff to train everybody in the company how to use this stuff. So
                    an attractive young woman came from IBM to teach us all. And I thought “hello,
                    hello.” She and I became good friends and somehow I managed to get her a
                    permanent position in our company. She left IBM and came to work for Benn
                    Brothers. We started going out and got married a year or two later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you where there, what sort of work were you
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: The full gamut of stuff. I started off working for a weekly news
                    magazine called Chemical Age, a magazine for the chemical manufacturing
                    industry, the DuPonts, the Dows, the ICI's and companies like that. And I did
                    reporting as a junior reporter for that. After I had done that for a year or
                    two, they thought it would be useful for me to get some advertising sales
                    experience to broaden my understanding of publishing. I did that for a few
                    years. And then towards the end, my last three years, I was made a publisher and
                    given a group of publications that I ran, both reference works and magazines.
                    And I did that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the publishing world in that area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: I thought it was fascinating. I thought it was really interesting.
                    Probably the least interesting work I did was the selling of advertising space
                    which, in the trade industry, is a pretty hard slog. Not that I had really hard
                    work, but it just wasn't terribly rewarding work. But I found the publishing
                    industry very interesting and in those days, of course, content was still set
                    with hot metal. They had linotype machines. It wasn't individual pieces of type.
                    But you went down to the printer on Thursday - the night that the magazine went
                    to presand you read proofs as they came off after the type had been set in hot
                    metal on the linotype machine. You were really involved in all aspects of the
                    production of magazines and reference works. So I enjoyed it.</p>
                <p>It was a pleasant life. I was paid a pathetic salary, but it gave me enough to
                    live on. And I had a modest apartment with a cousin which we shared in Earl's
                    Court. And then moved into a classic sort of late-'60s, early-'70s set up in a
                    very nice row house in Central London, where I shared a house with four other
                    people, two men and two women. It was just a very pleasant relationship. And we
                    had a nice house. I lived there for three or four years before my wife and I got
                    married and bought a house in Fulham in Southwest London.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I always think of some of the battleI'm not sure when it
                        happenebut with Murdock and the press. As an American, how did you observe,
                        they call it “class conflict,” particularly within a business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Well the class system then and I think probably now is just really
                    entrenched in the UK as it is in many places. I think in France, although they
                    don't carry titles, there is still very much that sentiment that there are
                    people who are inherently more important because of their family background and
                    that sort of thing. But it was very evident in the U.K It could be very
                    frustrating at times. I think there is less of that now than there was then.</p>
                <p>It was a time of considerable labor strife. The publishers had not yet taken on
                    the unions on Fleet Street, but there was still extraordinary feather-bedding.
                    All the major publishers were still right there on Fleet Street. There was,
                    however, the garbage strike that went on for something like three months. And I
                    can remember driving around Berkeley Square, one of the most beautiful squares
                    in London, and it was piled six feet high with garbage bags. The whole area.
                    There were some pretty tough times. Harold Wilson was the prime minister. There
                    were some very difficult labor problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved as your responsibility?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: No, not really, because we were in business publishing. So those sorts
                    of events didn't really come to my attention. Occasionally people would approach
                    me for comments, knowing I was a Vietnam veteran, about anti-war protests. And
                    of course I had nothing to do with the American embassy, so I rarely went to
                    Grosvenor Square where the American embassy is. There were major protests there
                    for days on end. But I rarely had anything particularly interesting to say about
                    it. I can remember a daily newspaper calling me once and saying what did I think
                    about all the protests about the war. And I said I thought it was reasonable
                    that they protest. I might disagree with them. So I didn't provide anything they
                    wanted to print. I just wasn't very controversial.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you sense a feeling of anti-Americanism at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: I don't think so. There was strong anti-war sentiment. I think
                    anti-Americanism in the UI think because I've now lived there for fairly long
                    stretches at a couple of timehas not changed very much. There are certain
                    relatively small segments, the British upper class, who can't get over the fact
                    that the British are no longer running the world and resent the fact that we are
                    the predominant military, political, cultural power in the world. And so they
                    are going to be anti-American or resentful. But I think the majority of people
                    who are in a position to know what is going on admire the United States. They
                    may not approve of everything and think we are a bit rough-edged and should be a
                    little bit smoother about things. But I think there is more admiration in the
                    UK. Even at all levels, I think, even in the working class levels, if you call
                    them that. It is probably not polite to call it that anymore, but from the shop
                    floor up to the boardroom I think you still find great admiration for the United
                    States.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You really hadn't had any real experience in American
                        business. As you watched business being conducted, did you see things you
                        thought were outdated or not the way you thought they should be done?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: I think you put your finger on it. I really didn't have that much
                    experience in the American corporate world to be able to make a comparison. I
                    know I thought various of the procedures were pretty archaic. The amount of
                    deference that you had to show to people above you in the chain of command
                    seemed to me a bit excessive. I remember I used to get my payslip every two
                    weeks. It was written in longhand with a fountain pen by somebody in the
                    accounts department. I thought, they have got to be able to do better than that.
                    This was 1968, 1969. They could have typed it or something. But you know, fairly
                    old procedures.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was a lot of business conducted in the boardroom? I'm
                        exaggerating . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Yes. There was very much that sort of thing for major items. The
                    members of the board of directors had their own bathroom on their floor of the
                    building. The tea lady came around every morning and every afternoon and served
                    tea. We got our tea in modest mugs and occasionally you would see the Board's
                    tea going on a silver salver and nice tablecloth on the little tea trolley, and
                    that sort of stuff. So yes, there was some of that. And I suppose half of the
                    board were people who had titles. They would be, “Sir John” this and “Sir
                    Edward” that. So there wasn't easy upward mobility. And I think a lot of Brits
                    admired that in American business there generally was a lot more mobility.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you keeping an eye on American publications?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: To a certain extent. I would read them. I would come back to the States
                    once a year. The company was kind enough, generous enough, to send me on a
                    business trip and I would spend a week around Thanksgiving or Christmas in New
                    York calling on clients that we had, companies which advertised in our
                    publications, who were based in New York, and then I would come down to
                    Washington to spend the holiday with family. So I kept an eye on U.S. media. And
                    they looked a little smarter, a little sharper, a little more smoothly produced,
                    a little more up-to-date than our publications did. But we published some very
                    good magazines and people wanted to buy them. It was a prosperous little
                    company, so we seemed to be doing things right. And were pretty good at keeping
                    up with technology as it existed in those days.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you did thus until . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: '68 to '76. I had been in the UK for eight years. I married a Brit in
                    '74. And I thought to myself, I need to make a fairly fundamental decision here.
                    It became clear to me - a number of things came clear to mthat no matter how
                    long I stayed in the UK. I was still going to be an expatriate living there. Did
                    I want to be an expatriate for the rest of my life? Did I want to re-establish
                    my Americanism by going back to the States? And tied into this cultural thing
                    that we've been talking about, it became clear to me that although I would reach
                    a management level in the company, I would never in any wildest dreams be put on
                    the main board of directors of such a stereotypically British company. They just
                    wouldn't have an American on that board. Whereas there were other people who I
                    thought were about of equal talenor may have even been, I dare say, of less
                    talent than I had at that stagwho were on the board of directors of the
                    company.</p>
                <p>So I thought, I think I do need to leave. And I thought, how can I do that and
                    maintain this wonderful international lifestyle that I enjoy so thoroughly? So I
                    wrote a letter to Henry Kissinger and said “Secretary Kissinger, how do I join
                    your operation?” And got a very nice letter back from somebody in the personnel
                    office of the State Department saying, “well the first thing you do is take this
                    thing called the Foreign Service exam.”</p>
                <p>So I took it while I was still living in the UK. At the end of 1975, I came home
                    foI think in those days, wasn't the exam always given the first week of
                    December? I think it was. I came back for Thanksgiving. Although the exam was
                    offered at the American Embassy in London, I took it here in Washington D.C. in
                    December of 1975. And then learned in the spring that I had passed the written
                    exam.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>We moved back to the States in the summer of '76. We decided to treat ourselves
                    and crossed the Atlantic on the QE2. And because my wife was in fact emigrating
                    to the U.S., she got one of these wonderful (relatively small) discounts that
                    British carriers still give to people emigrating from the UK. If you emigrate to
                    Australia, New Zealand, the United States, or Canada I suppose, you get a
                    discount as an emigrant. So she got ten percent off her fare on the QE2 as I
                    recall. And we came back the summer of '76.</p>
                <p>I took the oral exam in August of '76. Passed that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall any of the questions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Yes. You know what I did waand I can't remember why I did iI think it
                    was my wife's idea. As soon as I got home from the oral exam, I sat down with a
                    tape recorder almost identical to yours and recounted every question I could
                    remember and every answer I could remember. And I've got that cassette at home.
                    So I should listen to it and refresh my memory.</p>
                <p>But the one that sticks in my mind was they asked “what do you consider America's
                    major cultural contribution to world culture.” And I said I thought the American
                    musical-Oklahoma, Carousel, those certain things have always been very close to
                    my heart, music I absolutely adorthe American musical. I thought was unique
                    enough that it could stand by itself as an American contribution to world
                    culture. They seemed pleased with that. And I remember almost getting the
                    datI've never been a historiaalmost getting the date of the Great Depression
                    wrong in one of my answers. But I did manage to quickly catch myself and say
                    that the Great Depression was in 1929 and not 1939. Other than that, I don't
                    remember what the questions were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time, were they looking at you to be a specialist
                        or something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: No, it was to be a Foreign Service Officer. But at that stage there was
                    a separate category. Instead of being an FSO, you were an FSIO, which was a
                    Foreign Service Information Officer. FSOs who worked for the USIA were called
                    FSIOs. You took a slightly different written exam. There was an essay portion,
                    which there was not for FSOs, which I always thought was kind of a cheat. I
                    thought FSOs got off easier than we did. But it was an interesting exercise. And
                    I did apply because I thought, looking at the various types of Foreign Service
                    Officers you could be, it seemed to me that a Foreign Service Information
                    Officer was what I would most like to be.</p>
                <p>So I joined. Again - and I guess it's not that much different today - I passed
                    the oral exam in the late summer of '76 and was not offered a position until
                    February of '78, so it was almost 18 months. It may have been 17 months.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do in the meantime?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: It was interesting. I did temporary work around Washington. And I
                    really did temporary work. I went to work for a large temporary personnel agency
                    called Manpower. I applied sort of half-heartedly for a couple of permanent
                    positions, but I thought I can't take a job without letting prospective
                    employers know that when I'm accepted in the Foreign Service, that's what I'm
                    going to do. I thought, that's only fair to them. And of course you aren't going
                    to get many permanent positions if people think you may be up and out in a few
                    months time. So I did temporary work, working in offices around Washington,
                    large and small.</p>
                <p>And after about six months of that I was sent to a small consultancy, a company
                    of maybe a dozen employees, 15 employees, run by a Hispanic woman. A typical
                    little Washington consultancy. The proprietor's specialty was doing work on
                    bilingual education, and whether American school systems should let kids study
                    in Spanish. And we got along well. I went as a temporary fill-in for somebody
                    who wasn't there for a few days being sick, and the proprietor, Lourdes Miranda,
                    hired me to stay on, and I worked for her for the best part of a year. And that
                    was an interesting experience. It was my first real experience with dealing with
                    the federal government. For instance, she survived on contracts with I guess
                    what would have been HEW at that stagHealth, Education and Welfare, wasn't it?
                    So I worked for that firm after having done temporary work. My wife went to work
                    for Arthur Anderson, one of the big accounting firms while we were here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you come into the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: I came into the Foreign Service in February of 1978. Almost exactly the
                    same time as they changed the name of the U.S. Information Agency to the U.S.
                    International Communication Agency, which caused misunderstanding everywhere in
                    the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, CIA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Well that was it. Just as there was the U.S. Agency for International
                    Development, they were going to call it the U.S. Agency for International
                    Communication, which would have been AIC. But stick that in a mirror and its CIA
                    and so on and . . . spies and whatever. So they called it ICA. No one I met
                    during the years it was ICA other than we employees at the agency had any idea
                    what the initials meant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was in Korea at the time and I remember it came around,
                        but I can't recall anybody really talking about it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Well not much. I mean, we stayed USIS abroad. And of course USIS is a
                    phrase that today - five years after USIA has gone out of existence - people all
                    over the world are still comfortable with using. So we were USIS abroad and as
                    soon as Charlie Wick came in as director of USICA he changed it back to USIA.
                    But we were USICA for a couple of years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came in in '78, how did they train you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: It was excellent training. It really was something that obviously
                    should be replicated today, I believe. We had training in Washington for six
                    months. Basic public diplomacy and diplomacy training. But when you went out on
                    your first JO touwe were called JOTs, junior officer traineeyou spent a month in
                    each of the other cones. To apply for our first assignment, we were given a list
                    of possible posts which we could rank order according to our preferences. I
                    think there were 15 posts on the list and I came up with what I thought were
                    very good arguments for why I should go to London or Rome or someplace like
                    that. In the event, I got assigned to my 11th choice, which was Accra, Ghana,
                    which turned out to be a fabulous assignment. We've loved all our assignments so
                    I don't rank them. But if I had to, Ghana would be right there at the top. We
                    just had a fabulous time. But to get back to training, USIA sent you off to a
                    post, and then you did a whole month in the political section, and a whole month
                    in the consular section, a whole month in econ and a whole month in admin. So
                    you really got a feel for what the other sections of an embassy did. And the
                    consular section was very small at the embassy in Accra.</p>
                <p>There was one consular officer, who was the consul, David Lyon, who is now chief
                    of mission in Suva, Fiji. And we've been friends since then. But I arrived in
                    his section as fresh meahe had not been able to travel outside the capital
                    because he was the only American consular officer therimmediately after my
                    arrival, he jumped on a plane or took the car or whatever and traveled all over
                    northern Ghana. And I sat there as acting consul for a month. No, he wasn't gone
                    a whole month, for a couple of weeks. It was probably some of the most strenuous
                    work I have ever done in the Foreign Service. Interviewing people. We had
                    non-immigrant visa applications every morning for three hours, I guess 9-12,
                    something like that, five days a week. And doing those interviews it is what
                    everyone who has done consular work knowwas just exhausting.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>And Ghana was in terrible economic difficulties at that time; people were
                    desperate to get out. So there was an enormous volume of applications for
                    non-immigrant visas. A large amount of cheating. It gave me a lifelong respect
                    for our consular colleagues and how important the consular function is to the
                    U.S. to our culture, our society and certainly to our government. The hard
                    thing, as I recall, was knowing that when these people came to the window, you
                    had the power to change their lives. If you said, “yes, you can go to the U.S.”,
                    people stood a great chance of their economic fortunes blossoming. But if they
                    stayed in Accra, their prospects were much less promising. And so given that and
                    given the large amount of falsification of documents, trying to keep your mind
                    clear, judging each person . . . you had to clean the slate, not pre-judge them,
                    and interview them. And it was hard, hard work. It really was. But I found it
                    enormously rewarding and, as I said, it gave me a lifelong respect for the
                    importance of the work our consular colleagues do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: We had two ambassadors. As a JO, I didn't spend much time with them.
                    They were both named Smith. This was just after Shirley Temple had left. She was
                    enormously popular as ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She had done a very good job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Very good job. But she left and we had a couple of Smiths. One of them
                    was Robert Smith and I can't remember what the second Smith's name was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a Thomas S. Smith and some other Smith. I can't
                        remember.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Maybe the other one was Thomas. But Robert was the one I remember. My
                    wife and I got to know the DCM and his wife more, who was very kind to us. They
                    live near us out on Massachusetts Avenue. I haven't seen them for years, but I
                    see their names in the little phone directory for our neighborhood. Ed and Mary
                    Holmes.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>We had a delightful tour in Ghana. We traveled a certain amount. We got to the
                    Cote D'Ivoire. We got to Togo. We didn't get as far as Nigeria, which I wanted
                    to. But we drove around a lot. Ghanians are just wonderful, wonderful people. We
                    loved the country, loved the people, loved the culture. But they were in
                    terrible economic straits. About once a month we would drive to Lome, Togo,
                    immediately to the east - which I think is a two or three hour drive over pretty
                    rough roads - just to go to a country where they had fresh food. And they had
                    big tourist hotels there. There were jumbo jets full of French and German
                    tourists coming down. We would take a cooler with us, a large cooler in the car,
                    and come back with cheeses and French bread and things like that. But as I say,
                    Accra was a fabulous assignment. And we have Ghanaian friends to this day. We
                    were there just one yea'78, '79.</p>
                <p>Another interesting aspect: you asked about training. USIA was very thoughtful.
                    In those days, before you could be tenured, you had to get off of language
                    probation. So they sent meven knowing that I was going to an English-speaking
                    countrthey sent me to a French language brush up course for 12 weeks so that I
                    could get my 3/3 in French and get off language probation before I went to my
                    first assignment. So I was tenured - in those days the procedure was commoI was
                    tenured before I went to my first assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any unrest or any problems in Ghana when you
                        were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Well, there were indeed. They had the first violent revolution in the
                    history of the country. They were the first country in Africa to gain its
                    independence. And Ghana's first leader, Kwame Nkrumah, had a very Socialist
                    orientation and it not surprisingly didn't really work. So, the country went
                    downhill and was taken over by generals. And they had panels of generals who
                    would run the country. And they would run the country for a few years and then
                    get increasingly corrupt. And the leader would be told politely by another
                    phalanx of generals “it's time for you to go. Please leave.” And then some new
                    generals would come in.</p>
                <p>Well in the summer of 1979 there was an uprising in the military lead by a guy
                    called Flight Lieutenant (pronounced “Flight Left Tenant” due to the country's
                    British connection) Jerry Rawlings. Flight Lieutenant is equivalent to a Captain
                    in our Air Force. Not a high ranking officer. And he led a revolution of junior
                    officers and enlisted men. And they took over the country.</p>
                <p>I remember many things. It was a very exciting time. How many people get to live
                    through a revolution? But one of the things that struck me then was how easy it
                    is to take over a country. The revolutionaries took over the airport, the
                    Ministry of Defense, the equivalent of the White House - where the general who
                    was in charge, was chief executive of the country, liveand of course took over
                    the military bases by having all the enlisted troops and junior officers on
                    their side. It really didn't take long and they had the country in a matter of
                    24 hours.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>We lived in a diplomatic enclave half way between the international airport and
                    downtown Accra. And adjacent to the international airport was the major
                    university, Legon. During that day, we would watch a helicopter flying back and
                    forth over our house. And it was Jerry Rawlings going to talk to the students at
                    the university to make sure they were on board with this revolution, and then
                    going back downtown to be in charge of the fight to take over the TV station,
                    the airport and the military headquarters downtown. But the insurgents had the
                    country in not much more than 24 hours.</p>
                <p>The end of the second day, they went on national television. I will always
                    remember that. I took still photographs of the TV screen because it was so
                    interesting. And I tape recorded on audio tape the broadcast. But here was this
                    array of people in military uniform. In ranliterallfrom privates to the most
                    senior being Jerry Rawlings, a Captain in the Air Force. No two uniforms at the
                    table matched. There were peoplprobably the Privatecouple of them with their
                    heads down on their arms on the table. Perhaps even asleep. It was not an
                    impressive array of strength or authority. But these guys ran the country, had
                    taken over the country.</p>
                <p>Our ambassador, Ambassador Smith, was extremely active all during this period, of
                    course, and was very successful in talking to the new leaders and helping them
                    to understand the consequences beyond those local to Accra: that you can't go
                    out and shoot everybody that was here before. The international consequences of
                    that would just be too great. You have to understand the consequences of now
                    being in charge of this country.</p>
                <p>The ambassador was not acting alone. Also with him were the British High
                    Commissioner, who was very influential; and other ambassadors and high
                    commissioners. In the whole coup, I think that less than six - maybe three or
                    four generals, previous rulerwere taken down to the beach, tied up against
                    poles, and shot. And the fact that those three or four people were shot
                    absolutely sent shock waves through the country. It was so un-Ghanaian. Now for
                    an African coup or a coup in any other country, you often expect hundreds if not
                    thousands of deaths in the process of a coup d'etat. In Ghana, to its credit,
                    the fact that three or four people were killed was absolutely a shock to the
                    country.</p>
                <p>It was a very sophisticated country, a very culturally rich country. I can
                    remember meeting Ghanaians who, not only had they gone to Oxford and Cambridge,
                    but their grandparents had gone there. Think of a black West African in the
                    early 1900s who can get to Oxford or Cambridge, he or she has got to be a pretty
                    special person. It's a very rich culture. Very established culture. Very
                    sophisticated people. And as I say, these very few regrettable deaths, but
                    really very few in number, caused absolute shock waves across the country.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>Rawlings then came in. He had some senior advisors among the students at Legon
                    Universitthe University of Ghana at Legowho were very left wing, some of whom
                    had gotten their undergraduate degrees in Soviet bloc universities. And some of
                    his economic policies really were very unfortunate and did not help the country.
                    Ghana had a long struggle with the IMF, the World Bank. But now, apparentlI have
                    not been back to Ghana since we left in 1979, but we follow Ghanaian eventthey
                    really are doing well and are one of the more prosperous countries in Africa.
                    And now, just as we used to go to Togo for the weekend to stock up on fresh food
                    and have a swim in the ocean and have an air conditioned hotel room, people now
                    come from Togo and I suppose even more from the Ivory Coast to Ghana for the
                    weekend to do that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned your Ghanaian friends. Was the United States
                        at all seen as important, or was it mainly British?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Well I think both. I think almost of equal weight. The Brits because of
                    the extraordinary historic links and the United States because of its position
                    in the world. For any foreign diplomat that any of us has met from any country
                    in the world, an assignment to Washington is the dream assignment. Even in the
                    old Soviet bloc, unless they were idiots, they wanted to serve first in a
                    Western country, but particularly in the United States. So I think there was
                    great respect for the United States in Ghana. Some resentment, as I say, among
                    left wing students. Again, you've had that in every country you've served in.
                    I've certainly had it in every country I've served in. Sort of a fact of life
                    and not something you get too excited about. But no, general respect for and
                    affection for the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feeling for U.S. information work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Well, I was a junior officer. I was made an Assistant Cultural Affairs
                    Officer in charge of the American Center, which was in its own compound. A
                    library, multi-purpose room, we had speakers programs, a lot of the traditional
                    things that USIS does in posts. And had a very active program. We traveled
                    around the country, had visiting lecturers, and it was a lot of fun. It really
                    was.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>Some of the things I remember, again minor anecdotes from the revolution. As is
                    often the case in countries like this, the waterfront in the capital is not
                    terribly attractive. But Ghana is on the Gulf of Guinea. The whole expatriate
                    community would drive every Sunday out to a beach about 30 miles east of Accra
                    where they all had little cottages. When a new officer came in you would take
                    over renting a little cottage for the year at a nominal cost. The Sunday after
                    the revolution we had gone out to the beach for the day and we were coming back
                    into Accra at about four or five in the afternoon. We came up on a long, long
                    queue of cars. And the rebel forcethe new authorities, they were at that staghad
                    set up a check point. I had diplomatic plates on the car and I was certainly too
                    full of myself. I thought, I don't need to stay in this queue of cars. So I
                    pulled out and went shooting up to the front of the line. And a soldier comes
                    over and waves me down, says “where are you going?” I said “I'm going to the
                    American embassy. I don't think we need to stop at your checkpoint.” And he said
                    “well you have to stop. If you hadn't stopped, I could have shot you.” So again,
                    being young and not very bright, I said to him “do you have any bullets in your
                    gun?” And he said to me, “that's a secret.” In retrospect it sort of makes my
                    blood go cold. He was right, he could have shot me and would have got away with
                    it completely. And it was not a very bright thing to do. But it's what I
                    did.</p>
                <p>And the other thing, we were in the house during the coup living below window
                    level. As my wife recounts, that also happens to be the time we conceived our
                    first child. There wasn't a lot to do at home. As I mentioned, we were in a
                    diplomatic enclave where there were a lot of foreign businessmeand as is often
                    the case in the developing world, when things start to go bad economically,
                    everyone looks for a scapegoat. And it is usually the foreign businessmen, the
                    Lebanese businessmen, the Pakistani businessmen, who are in fact keeping the
                    economy running. But they are the target because they are living well it's easy
                    to say “they are breaking down our economy.” So a group of rebel soldiers in a
                    big truck, like a deuce-and-a-half, came driving through the neighborhood
                    looking for foreign businessmen to take off somewhere. I don't think they killed
                    them in the end. But they did take them off for interrogation. And this was a
                    little bit disconcerting.</p>
                <p>But our gardener Al Hassan was out mowing the lawn with his hand mower when these
                    guys came back. Things had quieted down a bit, and we were peering out the
                    window. The truck comes roaring up and screeches to a halt in front of our gate.
                    And the guys start talking to Al Hassan, and we don't know what they are talking
                    about. Well what they were saying was “who lives in this house.” And he said,
                    “Oh, they're Americans and you don't need to worry about them.” And the guys got
                    back in their truck and drove off. So Al Hassan after that could do no wrong. He
                    was not the greatest gardener in the world but, boy, we were sure going to keep
                    him onboard.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>The embassy had given us a letter, given everybody in the embassy a letter, that
                    you stuck it in the window of your front door. It was on embassy letterhead and
                    it said “these are diplomatic premises. You may not enter here without the
                    permission of the U.S. embassy.” And then there was a big red seal at the
                    bottom. Everyone agreed that the text was meaningless but that when people saw
                    that big red seal, that would probably stop them from coming into the house. And
                    it did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there, was there any concern about Soviet
                        influence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Not so much directly. I didn't get so much into the intelligence aspect
                    of it, so I don't know how active the Soviets were. But there was a strong
                    strain in the student body of students who had been educated in bloc
                    universitiebecause the Soviet Union gave enormous grants. As I understand it, it
                    wasn't that difficult to get a grant of tuition to go to a university in Eastern
                    Europe, so a lot of the graduate students in the Ghanaian universities had got
                    their undergraduate degrees in the Soviet bloc. There was a definite influence
                    there. But it was not something that I particularly was aware of.</p>
                <p>The closest I came to anything approaching intelligence work, which was not
                    intelligence work happened the day after the coup. Jerry Rawlings called a press
                    conference at which he was going to meet the foreign press. Well, there were
                    almost no foreign press in Ghana, but some had flown in for the event. And the
                    embassy was very keen to have a representative in this press conference. So
                    since I worked for USIA, we thought it wasn't completely implausible that I had
                    a connection with the Voice of America. So I went in. I put myself down as a
                    Voice of America correspondent, for whom I could have easily filed a report, and
                    went and covered the press conference. I got back to the embassy and everybody
                    wanted to know who was there? Where were they sitting? And who seemed to be in a
                    position of authority? And that sort of thing. Having been, again, a junior
                    officer, I wasn't intimately aware of the faces of all the senior people in the
                    Ghanaian government. So I wasn't much help. But it was an interesting
                    experience. And one of the things that struck me about it was, what a
                    charismatic guy Jerry Rawlings was. It was like when I came in contact with the
                    Pope, you just felt when you were in a room with him this charisma. He was a
                    very attractive personality and you felt it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in '79?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Left there in '79.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: We went on direct transfer to the southern Philippines. At that stage
                    we had an American Center on the island of Mindanao, in the far southern
                    Philippines. It is the largest island or the second largest island in the
                    Philippines. And the U.S. had an American Center. We did not have a consulate
                    there. There was only one consulate outside Manila and that was in Cebu. We had
                    an American Center there also. USIA had a USIS center in Cebu. And we had our
                    USIS center in Davao, which is a very agricultural area. Davao was a big city of
                    half a million people, but the island of Mindanao was pretty rough, mountainous,
                    a lot of agriculture.</p>
                <p>The reason we were down there, partly, was because there were a lot of big
                    American business interests there. There were enormous plantations. Banana
                    plantations. Pineapple plantations. And Dole, Del Monte and United Brands all
                    had just gigantic operations down there. We were one of only three diplomatic
                    entities on Mindanao. I had diplomatic status, but as I say it wasn't a
                    consulate. There was the American presence, which was me. It was one American
                    and I had eight FSNs.</p>
                <p>The Japanese also had a diplomatic mission there, and the Indonesians had a large
                    diplomatic presence which mostly consisted of consular officers because that
                    part of the Philippines, lying near Indonesia, has historically been owned by
                    Indonesia and by the Philippines. The island of Mindanao moved back and forth in
                    ownership. And so there are a lot of people with Indonesian citizenship there. I
                    think there were a dozen or 15 Indonesian diplomatic personnel at their mission
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Well, I ran the American Center. It was a dream jobs for a young
                    Foreign Service Officer on my second assignment. I did everything. I did some
                    political reporting for the embassy. Did a lot of cultural programming. There
                    was a lot of press in the Philippines. Most of it was highly irresponsible. But
                    there were one or two newspapers that you could talk to and make some sense
                    with. And I just did everything.</p>
                <p>I traveled all over the island. There was still an activas there is
                    todainsurrection going on. There was the New People's Army, the Communist
                    insurrection, which was relatively small, and the Moro National Liberation
                    Front, the MNLF, which was large. Americans and other foreigners generally could
                    not travel around the island. But I had as one of my cherished possessions a
                    letter signed by Juan Ponce Enrile - who was Minister of Defense at that time,
                    and went on to be one of the leaders of the revolution that threw out Marcos.
                    The letter says “Mr. Shinkman of the American Center is allowed to travel
                    anywhere in Mindanao that he likes.” That was kind of a fun thing to have. And I
                    did. I traveled to San Zamboanga.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The monkeys have no tails.</hi>

                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: The monkeys have no tails. That's right. One of those places a lot of
                    people who like to travel think of one day going to. So I did. I had a good time
                    traveling around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you see the revolt, both the Communist and Moro
                        revolt.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: I never felt danger. Well, I won't say I never felt danger. I never
                    felt targeted. I thought that if we were injured in thithese revoltit would just
                    be because we were in the wrong place at the wrong time. It would be because my
                    wife was shopping in the market and somebody rolled a grenade into the market.
                    It would be that sort of thing. We never felt targeted at all.</p>
                <p>Plus, the Embassy had its own airplane. The Ambassador had a little twin engine
                    plane that sat eight or ten people. Richard Murphy was our ambassador. A
                    terrific ambassador. Very supportive of us in the south in Mindanao. And he made
                    it very clear that if at any stagwe had a shortwave radio with which we could
                    communicate with Manilhe said, “if at any stage you feel endangered and want to
                    get out of there, we'll have the plane down there as fast as the plane will fly.
                    It will probably be about an hour and half and we'll have you out of there.” So
                    that was comforting also. My wife and I talked about this a lot.</p>
                <p>We lived in a gated community. And we had an armed guard at our house 24 hours a
                    day. I don't really know how effective he was, but I guess he was something of a
                    deterrent. But as I said, we didn't feel targetemaybe it was because we were
                    young and foolish, but I don't think so. We talked about it a lot and we felt
                    that the situation was probably okay.</p>
                <p>One of the occasions when security really came up again was after I got to know
                    the governor of one of the adjoining provinces. He offered us the use of his
                    beach house if we wanted it. So one weekend we thought, we'll go off to his
                    beach house. It was about an hour and a half drive from Davao over pretty rough
                    roads. Well we got to the place and it was an absolutely beautiful, beautiful
                    beach house. Just splendid. Tile roof, stucco. On a beach with no other
                    developmena couple of fishing hutbut no other development in sight. It was just
                    an idyllic setting. And the local villagers or the people who maintained the
                    house for the governor had slaughtered a little piglet for us which was
                    “lechon”, a great Philippine delicacy, roast suckling pig. And they brought some
                    fresh fish they had just caught. It was absolutely gorgeous. We had a little
                    baby at that time. Our daughter was born, our first child, while we were in
                    Davao. She wasn't born in Davao, but while we were stationed there. And we had
                    taken one of our domestic staff along with us.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>Well, we spent the first night there. And at one stage the local fire trucwater
                    tanker - showed up with water to fill the tank on top of the house because there
                    wasn't a well. I thought it was interesting that the fire department would take
                    on this task. But I guess if you are the governor you can do what you like. So
                    they filled us up with water. Well, we woke up the next morning and surrounding
                    the house was a squad of soldiers with M-16s, all of them. It was a stunning
                    sight to get up and look out the window. There every ten feet all around the
                    perimeter of the house was a soldier in fatigues with an M-16 over his soldier.
                    And my wife took one look and looked at our three month old baby and said “we
                    are out of here right now.” So we got back in the office car and drove back to
                    Davao. I, of course, had permission to use the office car because it was lightly
                    armored and the embassy said I could use it for these sort of excursions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in any Philippine-Indonesian disputes
                        while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: No. We became fast friends with the Indonesian consul general. A very
                    nice guy. We used to go over to his house for endless “cultural manifestations”,
                    as they were usually called in Eastern Europe. Lots of dancing and puppetry.
                    Beautiful, beautiful stuff. I mean it was a very, very rich experience. But no
                    real conflicts. At that stage Ferdinand Marcos had an iron grip on the
                    Philippines and I don't know who would have been in Indonesiwould it have been
                    Suharto back then? but there was minimal room for visible friction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah, it would have been Suharto.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: So the two leaders each were smart enough to keep their hands off the
                    other's territory. I never met President Marcos but Imelda came to Davao for
                    some function and I met her as the American diplomatic presence on Mindanao.</p>
                <p>But as you can imagine in this remote place, there were endless interesting
                    adventures. And I will always remember on the wall of my office I had a maa
                    National Geographic maof Mindanao. Not more than 30 miles from my office there
                    was a line drawn on the map separating two provinces. And printed by National
                    Geographic on this line in brackets were the words “Unexplored.” And I thought,
                    My God, I'm sitting here in a U.S. government office, air conditioned, with a
                    car outside. And not fifty miles away as the crow flies is an area that is so
                    rugged thaobviously it has been explored by natives who lived there. In the
                    Philippines, like many places, they are always “discovering” new sorts of “stone
                    age” tribebut this place is so remote and so rugged and so inhospitable that
                    National Geographic says that border is unexplored. I thought that was kind of
                    impressive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well who were your clients?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Mostly prominent Filipinos. Businessmen, government officials. I mean I
                    knew everybody on the island. And because they were well to deither because they
                    were well to do, they were very prominent, or they became prominent because they
                    were, however you want to work thawe got to know everybody. And we made some
                    good friends. There is a very prominent Filipino family which I think still is
                    very prominent called Aboitiz who own one of the world's major shipping lines.
                    One member of that family, Ernesto, was based in Davao overlooking their
                    plantation holdings. And he and his wife Marie we got to know well. People just
                    liked having us there, it seemed. They were very supportive. Very friendly. We
                    really had a very pleasant two years.</p>
                <p>Our baby was due in April of 1980, the middle of our tour there. And being a
                    good, young, Foreign Service family, we thought we would try and have the baby
                    there, in Davao. We looked at the hospitals and they were pretty marginal. But
                    we had an excellent local pediatrician who had received his degree from medical
                    school in the United States, as so many prominent Filipinos had. So we had a
                    high comfort level with the skills of the medical people. The facilities were a
                    bit marginal.</p>
                <p>But then the Philippines at that stagMarcohad something where he could declare a
                    person a National Treasure because they were so prominent. It was like getting a
                    Kennedy Center Award or something. About two months before our baby was due our
                    pediatrician was declared by Ferdinand Marcos a National Treasure and around the
                    time the baby was due, he was going to have to go to Malaca�ang, the palace in
                    Manila, for his awards ceremony. So we thought we'd rather not, at that stage,
                    try to find another local doctor. There was a Regional Medical Officer in Manila
                    who said “you go up to the USAF Regional Medical Center at Clark Air Base, which
                    is one of the best, world class medical facilities, and have the baby
                    there.”</p>
                <p>I had stayed in the Army Reserve after I got off active duty in 1968 and did two
                    week tours of active duty each summer somewhere in the world. And I arranged to
                    do a two week tour in Quezon City, just north of Manila, where we hajust like we
                    had in Vietnaa JUSMAG headquarters. And I went up. My wife came with me. This
                    was about a month before the baby was due and I had two weeks in Quezon City
                    staying in the visiting officers quarters. And we then moved to Clark Air Base
                    and stayed there for a couple of weeks. About that time, my mother flew over
                    from the States and joined us. And the baby was born in April of 1980 in Clark
                    Air Base Regional Medical Center, which gave us a lifelong love and respect for
                    the Air Force and their medical facilities. Just fantastic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then it is probably as you say a good place to stop
                        here. We'll put at the end here, where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: From there we finished our two years. I got an assignment in Belgrade.
                    We came back to Washington. Had one year here of language training.
                    Serbo-Croatian. And then went to Belgrade from '82 to '86.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. We'll talk about that next time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: I would enjoy it.</p>
                <p>* * *</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, today is the 13th of December 2004. You took Serbian
                        from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: We were at language training at FSI from the fall of 1981 to the spring
                    of 1982. 44 weeks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Serbian?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: The language was extremely difficult, I thought. I have a strong MLAT
                    [Modern Language Aptitude Test] score so I was a prime candidate for a hard
                    language. But I came out of it fine. Got my 3/3. An interesting anecdote I've
                    told many times: first week in class they divided the students into different
                    categories and it wasn't quite clear how they chose who was going to go into
                    what class. But anyway, I found myself in a class with about five students. And
                    we would start some very basic Serbo-Croatian. We would go around the table and
                    all the other four seemed to pick it up really quickly and then it would come to
                    me and the rapid pace would come to a screeching halt. I couldn't figure out
                    what the hell was going on. And this happened repeatedly. I would go home at
                    night and say to my wife, “I'm not a stupid person. I'm good at languages. I'm a
                    good mimic. Why am I not getting this?” Well, it turned out, I learned at the
                    end of the first weethey let everything settle down for a week, of coursthat all
                    four of the other students had studied Russian in high school. So they had a
                    familiarity with not only the structure of a Slavic language, but also with the
                    Cyrillic alphabet. And this was not made known to me before class and so it made
                    me feel absolutely awful. And at the end of the week they took those four who
                    had the Russian familiarity and put them in a separate class and I joined a
                    class of students like myself who had never seen a Cyrillic alphabet before in
                    my life and had not studied languages structured like Slavic languages, which of
                    course are structured a lot different than English is or romance languages
                    are.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you picking up from your teachers? Often one
                        gets quite familiar with a country or gets a feel for the ethos or whatever
                        you want to call it of the country from your teachers.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: They were an interesting bunch. The head of the Serbo-Croatian
                    department; as it was then, was a priest in an Orthodox church. I learned a lot
                    more than I had ever known in my life about the Orthodox church. It was
                    absolutely fascinating to me. I think the quality of teaching was generally
                    good. A couple of weak points, but generally good. We had an older guy who I'm
                    sure cannot be there anymore because he was elderly, but he was teaching us 22,
                    23 years ago, who was a member of the Royal Navy back when Serbia briefly was a
                    kingdom, I guess. And a little side anecdote for that. Later on, during the
                    fighting in Yugoslavia in the early '90s, when I was in London, I went and had
                    lunch with the crown prince of Serbia - or maybe it was the crown prince of
                    Yugoslavia?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Crown prince of Yugoslavia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: No, but it was Serbia, Croatia and maybe even Slovenia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The kingdom of Slovenes. The Serbs, Croats and
                        Slovenes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: The kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. Yes. That's who he was. And
                    he had actually been born in a grand hotel in London. I think he was born in the
                    hotel, whatever that famous hotel is on Park Lane. The Dorchester, I believand I
                    believe they declared that suite to be sovereign Serbian territory for the time
                    it took him to be born so that he could ba great, rather thin, subterfugso that
                    he could claim to be born on Serbian soil. And we had a pleasant lunch as I say
                    ten years later in London. He's a stockbroker in London and doing very well at
                    it.</p>
                <p>Anyway, so yes, we studied the language. I learned the language. I learned a lot
                    about the Orthodox church. Most of the language faculty of course were
                    vehemently anti-Communist. Not surprisingly. And pretty much anti-Tito. And just
                    sort of what you would expect. But as I said, pleasant people and a variety of
                    teaching styles and teaching skills.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for the Serb-Croatian tensions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Yes. Absolutely. One of the teachers, typically, taught Croato-Serbian,
                    as it was called. And that was for the students who were going to Zagreb. And we
                    would occasionally have classes with that teacher just because it was not a
                    large department at FSI. A teacher would be sick or something and not show up.
                    So the Croato-Serb teacher would take the class. There wasn't hostility but you
                    very much got the sense that they felt that they were two distinct cultureSerbs
                    and Croatand, you know, there was some friction there, animosity.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went out when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: So I went out the fall of 1982 to Belgrade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: '82 to '86. It was a three year assignment. I extended for a fourth
                    year. We had two very young children and I thought it would not serve their
                    purposes well for us to be moving too soon. Our son was born while we where
                    there, in '83. As I may have mentioned before, I was in the Army Reserve for a
                    long time, which overlapped with much of my Foreign Service career. And so in
                    '83 when Paul was due to be born in August of that year, I arranged with the
                    Pentagon and with the State Departmenor the embassto have an Army Reserve touone
                    of my two week summer tourin Stuttgart, and went up there with the family, with
                    our little daughter Claire, who was born in the Philippines, who was then three,
                    and my wife, who was heavily pregnant. We had two weeks in Stuttgart and then
                    went up to Frankfurt and had another couple of weeks there of annual leave on my
                    paror sick leave, I don't remember whicwhile we waited for the baby to be born.
                    And Paul was then born on August 23rd of 1983.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At Ninety-Seventh General?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: No. We had the choice of Ninety-Seventh General or the U.S. Air Force
                    Regional Medical Center at Wiesbaden. Because we had had such a positive
                    experience with the Air Force Regional Medical Center in the Philippines when
                    Claire was born, we chose to go to the Air Force Regional Medical Center. And it
                    really was a very good choicboth times the children were delivered by nurse
                    practitioners, not by doctors. Doctors obviously were close at hand should they
                    be needed. The nurse practitioners were both Lieutenant Colonels in the U.S. Air
                    Force. In the Philippines it was a woman, and in Wiesbaden it was a man who
                    delivered the baby.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now you were what? What was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: I was the Director of the American Center, which was separate from the
                    American Embassy. The American Embassy was off Kneza Milosa, and we were I guess
                    a mile or maybe two away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Cika Ljubina.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Cika Ljubina. Good for you. Absolutely right. And it's not always a bad
                    thing to work away from the embassy compound. There is a little bit of distance
                    so you can go over to the embassy when you need to be there. But you could also
                    get away from it and get out and do your job. The setting wayou know the
                    building, obviouslit was a beautiful setting on a corner at one end of this
                    historic street in Belgradabout all that's left of Belgrade, really, that's
                    historic and attractive. In Skadarlija, the region that has been largely
                    preserved.</p>
                <p>I had the nicest office I've ever had in my life with tall ceilings and tall
                    windows, looking down a grand boulevard. And in the American Center we had
                    printing works, we had a constant series of art exhibits in the gallery, we had
                    visiting speakers, we had a very active library, research center. It was a very,
                    very active American center, which I believI was tolwas the oldest in Europe. It
                    has opened before the end of the Second World War. After the Allies marched
                    through Yugoslavia on their way toward Germany, the American Center was opened
                    immediately. So it was opened sometime early in 1945, I suppose, or late 1944.
                    But it was, as I say, a beautiful location.</p>
                <p>It was an interesting job. I met all manner of Yugoslavs, of course. It was an
                    odd time because Tito had died a year or two before. '80 or '81, I don't really
                    remember. And I think everyone felt that he had been masterful at holding
                    Yugoslavia together through the sheer power of his personality. So, everybody
                    felt that the country would collapse after his death. And it didn't. So people
                    were cautiously optimistic. And sort of felt, “gosh, maybe this will work.” And
                    that continued for the whole time we were there. The whole time up until 1986
                    when we left there was a sense that, “gosh, maybe we can make this work.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now who was the ambassador while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: There were two ambassadors during my stay. The first was David
                    Anderson. Both of them were terrific. He was there for my first two years at
                    post, as I recall. And during my third year, Jack Scanlon arrived. They both did
                    an excellent job. They were very good at working with the leadership of the
                    country and did a lot for U.S.-Yugoslav relations.</p>
                <p>It was interesting. Of course, the economy was always in difficult straits. The
                    Yugoslavs were very proud of the fact that they were the only country,
                    apparently, to have ever kicked the Soviet military out. The Yugoslavs left the
                    Soviet bloc officially in the late '40s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '48.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Something like that. '48, '49. And they were very proud of that. They
                    liked to think of themselves as more Central European than Eastern European. To
                    us, I think basically, or to most people who didn't study it very closely, they
                    were just another East European country which didn't happen to be behind the
                    Iron Curtain. But they were still in that camp. The Yugoslavs liked to think of
                    themselves as being more sort of Austrian. And actually, of course, they had
                    many, many links to Austria as well as to Hungary. There was the Hungarian
                    province north of Belgrade, Vojvodina. And in Slovenia, there were areas along
                    the border with Austrias we discovered by traveling therwhere on the Austrian
                    side children could go to elementary school and the medium of instruction would
                    be Slovenian. It was territory that had moved back and forth between the two
                    countries over time. And you could, as I say, study in Slovenian in Austria,
                    which is kind of interesting.</p>
                <p>Belgrade itself is not a very interesting city. It was largely leveled by the
                    Nazis at the beginning of the Second World War and then leveled again by the
                    Allies at the end of the war, as you know. But it is a wonderful jumping off
                    point. We did more traveling from Belgrade than from anywhere else. We would
                    regularly spend a weekend in Budapest, travel up into the Alps in Austria for
                    New Year's. We would take the car train up to Ljubljana overnight, with a
                    sleeping compartment, and then have a car there and drive into northeastern
                    Italy and have a vacation in Venice or Florence. Every spring we drove due south
                    down through Macedonia to Greece and took a villa on a Greek island for two
                    weeks. Just fabulous vacations and none of them very expensive. Obviously,
                    couldn't afford expensive vacations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During '82 to '86, what was the Center doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Well it was outreach to the community. We did a lot with the cultural
                    community, of course. We did a lot with universities. An awful lot of students,
                    of course, university level students. We ran a very active speakers program,
                    much of which fell in my lap. I figured out afterwards that I programmed almost
                    a speaker a week, maybe a speaker a fortnight, over the period I was in
                    Belgrade. So we were out at the Serbian Institute of Architecture, or Civic
                    Engineers, or whatever, and we would have somebody over from the States to talk
                    on that institute's interests. We had a very well known speaker, Ellis Katz, who
                    was head of the Federalism Center at Temple University, who came — a most
                    engaging speaker, because the Yugoslavs were trying to set uor thought they had
                    set ua federal system and thought that elements of it would be similar to ours.
                    So we had a very active speaker program. Lots of outreach to institutes, to
                    universities, cultural programs, just the whole gamut of those sorts of
                    programs. It was an interesting time and, of course, one of the great fun things
                    about being a public diplomacy officer is that you meet these speakers coming
                    from the States who are the top in their field. It was fun to hear these people
                    talk about anything from architecture to federalism and some of them remained
                    friends after we returned to the States.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>Belgrade was an interesting assignment. The economy of course was struggling.
                    Tito, as you may remember, had this policy called “Republikanski Kluc”, the
                    “republican key”, which meant that every one of the six republics had to have
                    what every other republic had. So you had an oil refinery in each of the six
                    republics. You had a steel plant in each of the six republics. And of course the
                    country was about the size of Wyoming, had 20 million people or something. Could
                    not possibly sustain these things. So this very political system was a great
                    drain on the economy.</p>
                <p>The decrepitude of the socialist system was evident to me visibly because those
                    partand this isn't really fair to socialisthose parts of downtown Belgrade that
                    had been rebuilt in view of my office had all been rebuilt with very poor
                    structures and poor concrete, and I literally could sit at my desk and about
                    once every few weeks. I would hear a great crash outside and would look outside
                    and a balcony had fallen off a building. It was down below and thank God no one
                    had been crushed by it. There would be a pile of rubble and smoke rising from
                    it. And that really did happen regularly just because the buildings were built
                    so poorly. But anyway, the Yugoslavs had hopes the system would work and as we
                    now know it did not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the ethnic tensions permeate your organization?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Not very much. No. But, they were evident in society at large. And I
                    have a classic example. I remember each republiwell, titles are very
                    importanthey would all have an Institute of Science and Technology, which was
                    the most important, significant organization in the society. And if you were a
                    member of that and could describe yourself as a member of that institute, that
                    was more important than being a judge or a lawyer, doctor or engineer. That was
                    the title you used. The Institute would publish tracts, as most sorts of
                    organizations do. And I remember one coming out one day, authored by a member of
                    the institute, which professed to say that the Albanian people were genetically
                    inferior to the people in other parts of Yugoslavia.</p>
                <p>Well I ran into a very good friend who was a professor at the university one day
                    who had been studying in the States. He had been there on a Fulbright, got his
                    masters degree at SUNY Binghamton or somewherand he was a member of the
                    Institute. And I said to him, “Voya, how could they print this rubbish? This is
                    crazy. This is nonsense.” And he laughed and said “oh, you don't want to worry
                    about that. For political reasons they have to print this stuff from time to
                    time.” Then he paused and he said, “but you know the Albanians really are a
                    pretty stupid people.” So there was obviously some irrational prejudice
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in putting anything in Bosnia or
                        Macedonia?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: We haagain because of the Republikanski Kluc - we had an American
                    center in each of the republics. We had six American centers and some of them
                    were very small and wouldn't under normal circumstances warrant having an
                    American diplomatic presence in that town. I did not supervise the other five
                    center directors but I was in close touch with them and in charge of feeding
                    material to them.</p>
                <p>So yes, we fed a lot of material to the other American centers. In Slovenia it
                    was warmly received and the Branch PAO (Public Affairs Officer) had a great time
                    because people loved to get stuff from him. At the other end of the spectrum was
                    Macedonia where it was a pretty hard slog. And Titograd which was the capital of
                    . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was the capital of Montenegro.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Montenegro, excuse me. In the capital of Montenegro it was very hard.
                    And the Branch PAO down there faced a really hostile audience. He had a hard
                    time getting people to come to the American Center for a lecture or anything. It
                    really was difficult for him. Sarajevo went through having the Olympics there in
                    '84 and they were much more sort of open and Western as I said. But for the guy
                    down in Titograd, Dell Hood, it was a tough slog. And I think our people down in
                    Macedonia had a pretty difficult time there too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah. These are sort of the end of the line, in old terms.
                        Sounds pejorative, but it would be basically a different country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Yeah. I think that would be right. I also remember a good example of
                    inter-republic rivalries or lack of cooperation. The Macedonians make absolutely
                    wonderful white wine. Absolutely delicious white wine. Of course at that time
                    the Yugoslav currency, the Dinar, was not convertible. But the entrepreneurs in
                    Slovenithe most highly Westernized republiwould buy the wine from Macedonia in
                    casks for almost nothing and then rebottle it in Slovenia in good
                    Western-looking Austrian bottles with handsome labels, giving the variety of the
                    wine, and then sell it abroad. They had the Pepsi Cola distribution rights. They
                    would pay for the Pepsi Cola to the Pepsi Cola Company with this white wine and
                    get Pepsi Cola back. So it was as good as hard currency in terms of importing
                    something. And the Slovenians did extremely well and the poor Macedonians got a
                    few cents a cask for their absolutely delicious white wine being drunk in the
                    West.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the students. Were you teaching English
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: We did not because the university had a very large, active English
                    teaching program. So we really didn't need to. There was ample opportunity for
                    people to study English. I worked closely with all the professors in the English
                    department at the University of Belgrade. We provided them with materials. Of
                    course, the wonderful publication English Teaching Forum is the publication that
                    the State Department produces. It's a fantastic magazine and just cherished by
                    these teachers and read by dozens of people per issue. We worked closely with
                    them and provided them with a lot of support materials. There was also the
                    British Council there and we always have a friendly rivalry with them about
                    whether the host country students will prefer to study British English or
                    American English. But we worked closely with the Council.</p>
                <p>I remember one interesting anecdote. I've had obviously no contact or experience
                    with North Korea anywhere in my career. But I remember talking to one of the
                    English professors at the University of Belgrade once and she said that she had
                    a coursKim Il-Sung was the North Korean dictator theand she had one of her North
                    Korean students ... There were a lot of third world students who came to
                    Yugoslavia because Tito had been very active in the Group of 77 and the
                    Non-Aligned Movement [NAM], he was very active along with Kwame Nkrumah and
                    others. But Yugoslavia was very big on the Third World scale and a lot of Third
                    World students came to Yugoslavia to study everything from veterinary medicine
                    to English. So, there were North Korean students there. And she called the
                    student in for his final exam in English and she was trying to think of some
                    subject that he could discuss and show his mastery of the language, and she
                    said, “Tell me about Kim Il-Sung.” Well, she said the blood absolutely drained
                    out of his face. He was terrified. Kim Il-Sung apparently was so revereof course
                    he was holy and everything elsthat even to mention his name was just way beyond
                    a simple mortal's ability. And she had to change the subject before he could
                    utter a word. The guy was just helpless. So that was funny. But yes, we worked a
                    lot with English language people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the main thing you were doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: I'm trying to think of themes that we had in our Country Plan as we
                    used to have for USIA. We wanted to support English teaching, of course. We
                    wanted to help support federalism. We thought that if the country was going to
                    work, I believe, it was our policy that to help them develop a federal system
                    was a good way to do that. So, as I said, we brought in speakers on federalism.
                    We talked a lot to the media. We did everything we could to encourage open
                    media. And of course the media was completely controlled. But there were
                    reporters or journalists who we were able to send to the States for IV
                    (International Visitor) tours and those sorts of programs. And there is no
                    question that those people came back with very different views than before they
                    left. For those sorts of people an IV grant can be life changing. And many of
                    our contacts who went on those programs came back.</p>

                <p>The only one who didn't benefihere's another little anecdote, I always have
                    anecdotes. Part of my territory, Serbia, of course, included the provinces of
                    Vojvodina to the north, which was the Hungarian ethnic region, and the Kosovo to
                    the south. They were given a title which meant that they had some autonomy but
                    in fact they had none. They were just part of Serbia. “Semi-autonomous region”
                    or something like that. So I would go down to Kosovo, I would go down to
                    Pristina every month or two with a visiting speaker or for some other reason and
                    always enjoyed it. A fascinating, very remote and rural area. But I found a
                    local party hack, a guy who had risen to a prominent position in the local
                    Communist party. And I thought maybe we could get this guy to the States - he
                    had been to the Soviet Union and treated royalland teach him a bit about an open
                    and free society. Well, it was in my whole careeand I've sent an awful lot of
                    people on International Visitor programit was the only one that was a complete
                    loss. He came back absolutely unchanged and very disgruntled because he thought
                    he had not been treated with the deference and respect that he should have been.
                    He expected to have chauffeured limousines to take him every where he wanted to
                    go. And as we always do on the International Visitors program, we try to put
                    visitors on local trains and planes and taxis or go with a group of people in a
                    van and do it the way we Americans do it. But he was not content that he had not
                    been met with chauffeured limousines at every turn. So he didn't do too well.
                    But we tried to get people from all strata of society, all variety of
                    professions, to the States.</p>
                <p>Federalism as I recall was one of our main themes. Yugoslavia was drafting its
                    constitution and it was something like the tenth constitution they had had in
                    twenty years. Unlike ours which is remarkably brief and crisp, theirs was
                    something like six hundred pages long and had everything down to the price of a
                    parking ticket, I think. Those were the sorts of things included in it. And we
                    were trying to help them establish a government that could sustain itself and
                    that would be responsive to the citizens of Yugoslavia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that the cultural establishmenI'm thinking
                        about plays, dancothers were coming and using your facilities to find out
                        what the Americans were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Well, they had some access. I mean for a Communist country they were
                    relatively open. It wasn't really a clamped down society. It was open in many
                    ways. I think they had their own access to news from the west and to cultural
                    news from the west. So I don't think that was a real problem for them. They
                    always hungered for more information and we provided it. But as far as we could
                    tell, anybody could come into our library who wanted to. And we had all the
                    latest magazines.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of books did you have?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Well again, the books I selecteand we spent a lot of money on books. I
                    don't know what the budget waprobably ten, fifteen thousand dollars a year. We
                    would select titles that we thought were the best of American literature, of all
                    sorts. And books about good governance. Obviously, as is our custom, we steered
                    away from technical books. But a lot of good literature. A lot of good stuff
                    about the social sciences. And then what people wanted. If I had a good contact
                    and he needed a book and he couldn't get it, I would buy it for him and put it
                    on the library shelves and he could borrow it and many other people could read
                    it also.</p>
                <p>As I say, it was really quite an open society. And an interesting thing: my wife,
                    while we were there, worked at a large refugee camp run by the U.N. High
                    Commission for Refugees [UNHCR]. In those days, in Soviet Satellite countries in
                    Eastern Europe to leave the country you had to go through a bizarre process of
                    getting an exit permit to be allowed to leave your own country. A lot of East
                    Europeans could get exit permits to go to their Socialist colleague country
                    Yugoslavia, when they couldn't get an exit permit to go anywhere in Western
                    Europe. So they would come down to Yugoslavia on vacation. They would get a
                    package tour to go to the Dalmatian Coast. And then would make their way up the
                    coast by foot or whatever to the Austrian border. Try and get across. The border
                    guards would stop them, generally in a friendly manner, and say “We cannot let
                    you cross. But go back to Belgrade, show up at the UN High Commission for
                    Refugees refugee camp and then you can stay there and eventually you'll go to
                    Australia or to the UK or to the U.S.” And my wife worked at the UNHCR refugee
                    camp teaching English.</p>
                <p>It was extraordinary ... another one of these things that we Foreign Service
                    officers experience so often: What people will do to try to escape from tyranny.
                    For Thanksgiving, we would invite people from the refugee camp to compeople that
                    my wife had met in her English classeto come for Thanksgiving dinner with us and
                    experience an American holiday.</p>
                <p>I remember one memorable Thanksgiving when we had a couple come who were both
                    dentists, people who were of a high social standing, from Czechoslovakia. They
                    had for a long time wanted to leave the country. They couldn't let that desire
                    be known, of course. So they started to build a house. And they built a whole
                    house from the ground up, with all of their resources, bricks and whatever, so
                    that when they went to apply for their exit visa down at the local government
                    office and the inspector said cynically “How do I know you will come back?” They
                    could say “My God, we just built this whole house. We've put everything we've
                    owned into it. Of course we're coming back.” And they got their visas. The whole
                    thing was a sham. It was a real house, but it was only built so that they could
                    escape. They turned up at the UN refugee camp and I think we actually bought
                    them some suitcases because they had nothing to carry their clothes in. Before
                    we left Yugoslavia, they got exit visas to emigrate to Australia. Again it was
                    interesting that Yugoslavia was a sort of byroad or crossroad where people from
                    the East could get there and then could get out.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have any ongoing programs there that the staff was
                        doing? Or did you have people sent to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: No. It would be people who came to us through the speakers program in
                    Washington. I mean, of course embassy employees like myself would go out and
                    talk to English classes and things like that. But most of the speakers program
                    was speakers brought in. And the Yugoslav staff would go with us, of course, to
                    these events, but didn't participate as spokespersons particularly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the authority of the Yugoslav government
                        responded to these lectures? Were you able to get visas from the ministries
                        and all that or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: It depended very much on the individuals. One of our strongest contacts
                    was the government press spokesman at the parliament. Ambassador Scanlon, after
                    he left government service, worked for a pharmaceutical company in Los Angeles
                    started by a Yugoslav immigrant. And that company hired this same man latethat
                    was years after we lefwho had been the government press spokesman in Yugoslavia
                    to work for them. So some people had the self confidence to work with us and I
                    guess had confidence in their positions. I'm sure they knew very clearly that
                    their contacts with us were being monitored.</p>
                <p>It always amused me, there was a very small Protestant church community that was
                    made up of expatriates. So we were active informally in church circles. We would
                    go once a year and have a service that was arranged at the Orthodox patriarch's
                    private chapel. I would talk religion to our contacts sometimes, in a very
                    casual social environment or whatever. And almost always thealthough obviously
                    organized religion was discouraged in a Communist societmany Yugoslavs would
                    still have their kids baptized at birth. All the children were baptized,
                    certainly that we knew. It would just come up in the course of conversation. It
                    was not something we would necessarily ask.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As I recall, you are sort of in a clad-iron type of
                        building at Cika Ljubina. Did you have any problems in the show windows
                        which you had at the center? Something the authorities would say “Well this
                        is out of bounds?” or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Not that I recall. It would have been a logical thing to happen. But I
                    don't recall it happening. Gosh, you know, now that you mention it, there's
                    something in the back of my mind, but I can't remember it. If it happened, it
                    only happened once during the four years I was there. And I don't think we
                    consciously, I'm sure we did not consciously choose materials that would not be
                    provocative. At the same time, we would not choose things that would be
                    provocative on purpose. But I think we just, you know, got exhibits from
                    Washington on whatever subject and we put them up. You know, we had a U.S.
                    Presidential election while we where there, so we put up stuff about the
                    elections and that sort of material. But no, I don't recall a problem with that.
                    The only thing I remember about the outside of the building is that someone came
                    once and put a little PLO Palestine liberation flag draped over our front door
                    one night. I turned it over to the RSO (Regional Security Officer) and I've
                    always kicked myself because I wish I had kept it. I think it would have been
                    such a neat souvenir. But I did the right thing and turned it over to the
                    RSO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well I remember I was there when Kennedy was assassinated.
                        And of course the window had all sorts of pictures of him. And there were
                        flowers laid there. It was very moving. Well, how were the police? I mean,
                        we are talking about the security apparatus. Were they a problem or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: I never had a problem. We had an unusual status. The American Center
                    Director was given special status, but not diplomatic status, which always kind
                    of irritated me. There would be a letter on the license plate for all diplomats.
                    I think the letter was “A.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “A,” yes. “60A.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: “60A” was the American. There would be two digits, the letter “A” and
                    then the number of the vehicle. And “60A” was the American embassy. And we were
                    “20E,” which was sort of “all other semi-official organizations.” I guess the UN
                    High Commission for Refugees for instance would be “20E” and maybe foreign news
                    agencies, I don't know. But anyway, it was people who weren't diplomats but were
                    sort of almost diplomats. As I said, it used to irritate me. But it didn't make
                    a big difference. We seemed to be treated the same as everybody else. I'm sure
                    when I traveled, particularly to places like Kosovo, that I was watched. I mean
                    you just assumed that you were. You assumeI have no evidence that our telephone
                    was buggebut we always assumed, every minute, that we were. I don't have any
                    evidence that my staff were reporting to the police. But in those sorts of
                    controlled societies, there are so many gradations of what it means to be
                    watched that I'm sure we were, whether it was just somebody checking in at the
                    local police station once a week or somebody actually doing it because it was
                    their job. So we were just always cautious about that. Careful not to say things
                    that were not politic when we were at home or anywhere else. There was always an
                    awareness, but it didn't disrupt our lives much.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Well, the Soviets certainly had a big effort there. But I'm not sure
                    how successful it was. A lot of Yugoslavs had studied in the Soviet Union and
                    had grants to go and study again, everything, in Moscow. But I think the
                    Yugoslavs really did, as I said, like to think of themselves as being sort of
                    Central Europeaand I think they liked to sort of mildly thumb their nose at the
                    Soviets, having, as I said, kicked them out and not being part of the Soviet
                    bloc. They were very proud of that, as they should have been.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Public Affairs Officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Bud Korengold, former bureau chief in Moscow for Newsweek. Bud is still
                    around, he's living in France at the moment with his French wife. He had joined
                    USIA as, I think, an editor when the Agency had a large publishing program. I
                    believe he came directly from Newsweek to become editor of one of our magazines.
                    And then, as he became more familiar with Foreign Service life, he applied and
                    was brought into the Foreign Service on a mid-level transfer. He was our PAO. He
                    went to post the same time we went, in the summer of '82. He was a terrifically
                    hard working guy and a terrifically nice guy. We became lifelong friends with
                    Bud and with Christine. He had been I think in Brussels in some position. Not as
                    PAO, I believe. I'm a little foggy here. But he got the job as PAO in Belgrade,
                    which was a very significant job in USIA in those days, one of the largest
                    PAO-ships. He had six American Centers, he had a couple dozen Americans working
                    for him. But then a guy he had worked for in Belgium, Charlie Price, went to
                    London to be U.S. ambassador and there asked USIA to send Bud up to be his PAO
                    in London. So he was with us in Yugoslavia for the first three years, I guess,
                    and then he went up to London to be PAO. A great assignment, of course. And
                    after that we got Michael Eisenstadt, who was also a very good PAO but a more
                    conventional Foreign Service officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mike Eisenstadt had been in Belgrade before, hadn't
                        he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: I believe so. I believe he had a tour earlier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah. I was there with Mike Eisenstadt and David Anderson

                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: I think he had been there before and I think that's one of the reasons
                    they sent him back. And he did a good job. But much more conventional. Bud was,
                    of course, very much the newspaperman sort of journalist and liked that aspect
                    of the work, I think, much more than the cultural work, but was very good at
                    both. Bud was a good, innovative PAO and we had good PAOs, as I said, both of
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then you left there in '86?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Left there in '86. Came back for my first assignment in Washington. I
                    was a Special Assistant in the front office of what is now called IIP, the
                    Bureau of International and Information Programs; at that stage it was just
                    called the P Bureau, the Bureau of Programs. The senior Civil Service staffer
                    there was a guy named Mike Schneider, who I'm still in touch with. He was the
                    Deputy Associate Director. At USIA, the Assistant Secretary level position was
                    called Associate Director. The Associate Director was a political appointee
                    named Charles Horner, whose wife was the head of OPM, Constance Horner. Charles
                    was the Associate Director, the Assistant Secretary level position. The senior
                    career person under him was Mike Schneider, who was the Deputy Associate
                    Director. And I was the Special Assistant there for two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be from '86 to '88?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: '86 to '88.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the director of USIA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: It has to have been Charlie Wick.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It would have been Charlie Wick.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: I think, but I get a little muddled with which years Wick was at
                    USIA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, he was there the whole time, the whole Reagan
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: I think he was, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the director of USIA impede on you at all? Did you
                        feel his hand?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Not really. We worked in offices just down the corridor from where he
                    was, so I saw him regularly and attended events where he was in the chair. But
                    he didn't have a particularly direct impact on me, which I think was fine by me.
                    He was a very energetic director of the agency and I think . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Well, just doing sort of Special Assistant stuff. Being helpful and
                    setting up meetings. Running around. It was a large bureau. We had, as I said
                    earlier, a large publishing office that published magazines. We had - was it
                    called Span or Scan? the magazine for India. It was an enormously big effort. We
                    had magazines for the Soviet Union. Of course we published a magazine that was
                    very highly regarded by Sovietologists called Problems of Communism that was
                    really the premier magazine in that field. So we had a lot of magazines we
                    published. We also ran the very active speakers program. It was a big active
                    bureau, as IIP is now in the State Department. And I was just doing whatever
                    Mike Schneider and Charles Horner wanted me to do.</p>
                <p>There were two other special assistants. One Craig Springer, who is now retired.
                    One Maria Copson, whose main liaison was with the Pentagon. She was a GS
                    employee. Craig was a Foreign Service Officer. And Maria went over subsequently
                    to work in the Pentagon. But yes, those were the sorts of things that we
                    did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much contact with the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: No. Not a lot. I would come over for meetings, but probably not even
                    weekly. Probably monthly, something like that. Not a lot. It was mostly internal
                    workings of the bureau that I was involved in. Charles Horner was very close
                    with various people in the White House, so he spent a fair amount of time at the
                    White House. But that was him. That didn't really bring me into that orbit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any geographic focus at all where you
                        were?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: No. Charles Horner was very interested in what was going on in Latin
                    America at that time. It was a time of great turmoil and revolutions and a lot
                    of fighting in Central America. And he was involved in that and had a trip or
                    two, I think, down among the Central American countries. But that would have
                    been the closest thing. He also haand this really wasn't a programming
                    activitbut he was always very interested in the Baltic countries and was very
                    keen to celebrate Baltic Independence Day and the fact that the United States
                    never, ever recognized the incorporation of the three Baltic countries into the
                    Soviet bloc. But that was, I think, more a personal whim on his part. Not a
                    whim, but a personal interest on his part and not something that got into our
                    programming very much. We did do a lot for Central America. And that was a focus
                    of interest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did that for . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And did you have another assignment after that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Yes, I had back-to-back assignments in Washington. I went from there tI
                    got the job, a wonderful assignment, of desk officer in the European area office
                    for an all-time great list of countries: the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada,
                    the European Commission as it was then, and the OECD. As any Foreign Service
                    Officer would appreciate, I had, of course to go and visit my posts. So I had a
                    wonderful trip that went from London to Paris to Brussels, back to Dublin, and
                    then back to Washington. It was a great trip.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If you are looking at it, these would almost be the
                        countries that I would think the tendency would be to almost write off
                        programs because they all know us . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: . . . so well. Yes. Well, of course the EC was in the process of
                    becoming the European Union. Those posts were all major missions. We had senior
                    FSOs as PAOs at all of them, running very active programs. It was less a problem
                    of getting them materials. In this case, the desk officer spent most of the time
                    coordinating the needs of the posts in Washington because they were very
                    important. The front office of USIA was interested in what was going on at those
                    posts. And certainly my boss, the Director of the area office, and his deputy
                    were very interested in what was going on in my posts. So when I went into a
                    meeting where there were all the desk officers, generally the interest would be
                    focused on what was happening in the Uthese were the years of Margaret Thatcher.
                    And we had such a close relationship with the UK. I guess we had the Falklands
                    during that time? I'm not sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, no. We have the Falklands in '82 I believe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Okay. So that was earlier. Yes. But the relationship with the UK of
                    course was so strong that that post was of great interest. The EC was becoming
                    the EU. At the OECthis is more State Department talk than foreign policy talwe
                    always had a question about whether we were going to have a USIA Foreign Service
                    Officer position there. We had closed the position down for a while. And then we
                    opened it up while I was on the desk, so of course it was “very important” that
                    I go to Paris and see how he was doing. Ireland was always what Ireland always
                    is, which is basically the IRA and relations between Dublin and Belfast.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And usually the care and feeding of a very political
                        ambassador with Irish roots or something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Yes. Exactly. Aged. Usually they were quite elderly people. Although,
                    my colleague here in e-diplomacy Joe Johnson was PAO in Ireland at that time. In
                    Dublin. We were chatting over dinner last week about the fact that that is one
                    post that seems to be almost cursed, they always seem to get really difficult
                    ambassadors. Without naming any names; I'm sure there have been some very strong
                    ones, too. And some of the FSN support staff were also quite difficult. So it's
                    not the sort of dream assignment that one might think. My God, go to Dublin and
                    listen to Dylan Thomas in the pub every night for four years. It could be a
                    pretty tough assignment, but it is a great place to be. So I had a good visit
                    there.</p>
                <p>I did, actually, have another trip planned to Bermuda largely because of the
                    International Visitor Program, well not because of the International Visitor
                    Program. Geopolitically Bermuda comes under the UK. So when they had twhich they
                    almost never difind out who was the desk officer for Bermuda, that would be me.
                    So I tried to convince my boss, the Deputy Area Director in EU, to sponsor me
                    for this great grand tour of Europe through the four capitals, and then to tack
                    on a trip through Hamilton, Bermuda on the way back to Washington. She was
                    rather skeptical, but not entirely unwilling, and said “Well if you can do it
                    without adding any cost to the airplane ticket, we can pay for a day of per diem
                    for you to be in Hamilton, Bermuda.” Unfortunately it turned out that it would
                    have added a lot to the airplane ticket. It would have been a lot cheaper just
                    to come back to Washington and do a round trip Washington-Hamilton-Washington.
                    So I never got to Bermuda on official business with the U.S. government. But I
                    tried. I also had a wonderful trip up to Canada, which was the fifth post I
                    looked after. The itinerary involved traveling from Ottawa to Montreal to
                    Toronto and then out to Vancouver. I really got my first taste of that
                    country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that our information focuafter all, they had
                        to subscribe to the same papers we do. Well, it's not quite that, but they
                        are following events in the United States extremely closely. Was there a
                        difference between say Vancouver and people in Ottawa and how . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Well, when we get to my assignment in Canada I think I can give a
                    better view of that because that definitely is the case. But it's not something
                    I really noticed, and that's another aspect about my assignment in Canada that
                    was so interesting. But I didn't really notice regional differences. I had just
                    the one trip during my two years. And the whole thing was within probably ten
                    days. So I didn't really have time to notice those distinctions. But we had a
                    very active Public Diplomacy program in Canada.</p>
                <p>A thing that Canada suffers from always is that feeling that the government in
                    Washington doesn't pay enough attention to it. And we had a very senior PAO
                    there, a very senior Foreign Service Officer, who was constantly frustrated that
                    he couldn't get more resources out of Washington for his program in Canada,
                    because the post was very active.</p>
                <p>Programming was very active at the European Commission, too. The OECD post was
                    just getting started back up again. But London was a large program, it must have
                    had close to ten Americans there and a large FSN staff. We had a CAO and two
                    ACAOs, and an IO and two AIOs. And another American position who did speakers
                    for all of Europe out of the London embassy. And an American secretary, and
                    American Deputy PAO, which you find almost nowhere anymore and that job has
                    since been cut. So it was a big active, prominent program.</p>
                <p>And of course, one of the major things you do - and again I'll get into this when
                    I talk about my London tour - is that we had very high profile ambassadors, of
                    course, very high profile. Plus you are in an English speaking country so,
                    whereas, if you are in Belgrade, no matter how good the American ambassador's
                    Serbian waand both David Anderson and Jack Scanlon had very good Serbiayou can't
                    go out and speak everywhere all the time. In the UK every venue is automatically
                    open to you. And there are just no restrictions. So the public relations and
                    public affairs demands on an ambassador are just enormous in a country like the
                    UK. And everybody wants to hear him speak. So it made for a very busy
                    program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, after two years of this, it would be 1990,
                        wouldn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: It was 1990. Exactly right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: I went off to London. By the spring of that year, I had no assignment.
                    USIA was already pretty much through the assignments process. It must have been
                    February or March and the PAO, one of the more famous PAOs in USIA, Sam
                    Courtney, who I knew well because I had been his Desk Officer, called me up and
                    said “things aren't working out between me and the current IO. If I let him go,
                    would you come and be the IO?” I said “Well, I certainly can't have anything to
                    do with anyone else leaving post.” But I went home and talked to my wife and she
                    agreed that if there was a posting on the Open Assignments List, that if press
                    spokesman, or IO London, suddenly became available, we would bid on it. And so
                    it did come available. And that summer, in August, we went to London.</p>
                <p>I timed our arrival for August thinking that all West Europeans are off on
                    vacation for the whole month. And a week before we got there, of course, Saddam
                    Hussein invaded Kuwait. So it immediately became just the most frantic job I've
                    ever had. I've never worked so hard in my life and I've never enjoyed the work
                    so much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: I was the press spokesman. I had two deputy Information Officers there.
                    A staff of about eight FSNs. London is an extraordinary media environment. You
                    have 11 daily newspapers. The full spectrum from sports tabloids to the Times
                    and the Telegraph, but all of them broadly read. The British are a great
                    newspaper reading public. So you had those journalists to take care of, who of
                    course all had their own sources of information. The weren't really relying on
                    us. But when we had speeches by the President or something that we wanted to get
                    out, we could get the press the full text of something where they may have just
                    seen the news report from Washington. Our job was to get full materials to them
                    absolutely immediately.</p>
                <p>We also had of course the large broadcasting networks there, the BBworld famous.
                    We worked very closely with the BBC World Service that is listened to all over
                    the world. Most of the major American media who have offices in Europe or the
                    Middle East have those offices in London. A lot of the Middle Eastern and
                    Northern African coverage from American media comes out of their bureaus in
                    London. So again, another big audience for us.</p>
                <p>In the Middle Easas I say, the first Gulf War was going oall of the expatriate
                    Middle Eastern media have their bureaus in London because of British historical
                    links to that part of the world.</p>
                <p>So we had just everybody there. It was extraordinary the amount of media and the
                    number of media outlets in London.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>With the Middle Eastern media, we started a brand new thing when I was IO; we
                    found an guy in the mail room at the Embassy who was Egyptian and absolutely
                    bilingual. So I got money from Washington to hire him half time, 20 hours a
                    week, just to read the expatriate Middle Eastern media in Arabic and do a
                    synopsis which we could then send back to Washington. It was a frenetically busy
                    time and of course the ambassador was constantly in demand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Originally, my first six months there it was Henry Catto. USIA had been
                    going through a very difficult stage with its leadership. Henry Catto was very
                    close to the Bush family professionally and I think personally also. The first
                    President Bush called him up and said “Henry, I need you to come back here and
                    take over USIA.” And so he, I think reluctant to leave London, of course, but
                    given really a great challenge and from the president, came back and did a
                    terrific job of pulling USIA back together.</p>
                <p>At that stage we got a guy who had been the Department's Assistant Secretary for
                    European Affairs, Ray Seitz, who had previously served in London as the DCM. He
                    came back as ambassador, and was the first eveand onlcareer officer to be the
                    American ambassador to the Court of Saint James's. He was there from the spring
                    of '91 until about the spring of '94, when he left. And that's when Admiral Bill
                    Crowe came in and became the ambassador. I worked with him for four or five
                    months and again, I had three absolutely brilliant ambassadors and I got along
                    enormously well with them. They were all media savvy, media friendly. They were
                    also greatly in demand. The phone at home would ring all weekend long with
                    requests to speak to the ambassador. And they'd want him in their studios at
                    seven o'clock Monday morning.</p>
                <p>There's a radio program called Today on BBC Radio Four, which is absolutely the
                    agenda-setter for the day, every day, in the United Kingdom, and it went on I
                    believe from seven to nine, or six-thirty to nine. The key period to be on that
                    show was betweens seven-thirty and eight-thirty, when people were getting up and
                    shaving and had the radio on. And inevitably if the Ambassador was on, later
                    during the day someone would come up to him and say “well I heard you on Today
                    this morning and you said this, that and the other.” So we wanted to get him on;
                    he was always amenable to being on, and the BBC wanted to have him on. I would
                    guess almost once a week, maybe once a fortnight, I'd be at the curb picking up
                    the newspapers at five in the morning, reading all the newspapers that were
                    important, then going to Winfield House to brief the ambassador as he went on
                    live on-the-air on the BBC from Winfield House at seven-thirty or eight o'clock
                    in the morning.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>And the only wamy wife would sathat we could get away from this was we would
                    occasionally take a long weekend at a cottage somewhere in Wales where they
                    didn't have a telephone. Of course we didn't have cell phones at that stage. And
                    so it was the only way really to get away from the work. But it was so much fun.
                    And you felt you were accomplishing a lot, because you were really getting a lot
                    of material, a lot of information into the media. Dealing with the BBC World
                    Service, whatever you are saying is being broadcast around the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The British presand I'm not sure about radio, because I'm
                        less familiar with the BBI mean, they've got some really vicious papers.
                        Some of their press is beyond belief practically.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Yes. Most of the press we dealt with were main stream. A lot of it was,
                    I wouldn't call it anti-American, but papers like the Guardian naturally will be
                    inclined to look skeptically at American foreign policy. The Times and the
                    Telegraph would be more amenable, usually, but not always. I would always say to
                    myself and to the journalists, “I don't really care what your opinion is. I
                    would like it if you like us, but that's not my job. My job is to make sure you
                    are informed and make sure that you have got all the information and that the
                    information you have is accurate and accurately reflects U.S. government foreign
                    policy. If that's the case, then you write what you like. As I said, I hope you
                    will write that you like it, but that's not my job.” I found them generally to
                    be fair, not always, but generally to be fair in their reporting and they may
                    just have had opinions that differed from ours.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you find yourself every once in a while coming up
                        against the, what was it the Sun or whatever it is . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: The Sun I think is the largest circulation English language newspaper
                    in the world. And I used to about once every two or three months go and take the
                    editonot the editor, the editorial page editoto lunch, just to chat with him. He
                    usually figured we weren't conservative enough as a country. I always remember,
                    he had something about Abraham Lincoln. He thought that Lincoln had just not
                    been that great a president. He used to tick of off things that he should have
                    done but didn't do, that sort of thing. It was sort of an odd relationship. But
                    I just wanted to know what this guy was thinking. I figured there were more
                    people reading what this guy writes, no matter what it is, than just about any
                    other writer or editor in the English language press in the world. So I wanted
                    to know.</p>
                <p>But we didn't spend a lot of time with the Sun or the Daily Mirror, which is the
                    Labor equivalent of the Sun. Our time was mostly with The Guardian, The Times,
                    The Telegraph and The Independent, and then also with the Daily Express.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about TV?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Television we did a fair amount, usually commentary programs. Not a lot
                    with their news reporting because they have big bureaus in Washington and New
                    York and we just were not able to contribute to that. But the ambassador would
                    go on news commentary programsort of the Ted Koppel type programquite regularly.
                    And again, there were only a couple of programs - there was one in particular,
                    and I can't remember what the interviewer's name was, but he was just such a
                    nasty piece of work. His goaas far as I could tell from watching the program
                    regularlwas just to be unpleasant. And I thought “We don't have to go there. His
                    program is not so important that it is critical that we be on that man's
                    program.” So I regularly turned down requests from his producers to have the
                    American ambassador appear on the show. But we appeared on lots of the evening
                    news analysis programs, as I said, the Ted Koppel, the Jim Lehrer type of
                    commentary programs.</p>
                <p>And radio. Radio was the big thing. I mean if you take NPR here and American
                    broadcast television and sort of invert their importance. That's the way it is.
                    Radio news, particularly for the people we were dealing with, was the way to get
                    your message across, much more than television.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would they listen to it in the car in the morning?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Yes. As they were shaving, getting ready to go to work in the morning,
                    and then listen to it in the car. But BBC Radio Four really was the agenda
                    setter for the day and inevitably, to repeat myself, if you were on in the
                    morning, someone would come up to the ambassador, or many people would come up
                    during the day and say “I heard you this morning on the Today program and you
                    said this and what about that.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here in Washington, it's usually the Washington Post and
                        the New York Times that are the agenda setters.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: More than radio. I mean some people listen to NPR, but it doesn't have
                    the clout that, as I say, in the UK radio really does.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the chattering class, the political
                        commentators and all that? You know, one always thinks of the French
                        intelligentsia as being somewhat anti-American. How did you find the
                        British?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: You got elements of that. I don't think you got a lot of it. I mean I
                    think you found it not just, as you say, in the chattering classes. You know,
                    it's a very, very hierarchical social structure and they also have titles and
                    all that sort of stuff. As much as they say it's not important, it is still very
                    important. And you will have that relatively small subset of Brits who can't get
                    over the idea that theirs isn't still the empire ruling the world. And those
                    certain people can be sort of tiresome and you just knew who they were and got
                    used to them and dealt with them. But the vast majority of people I
                    thinintelligent, thoughtful peopladmired us for what we've accomplished, admired
                    our society, had strong differences with us on things like gun controof course,
                    the obvious one that comes up time and agaibut generally admired the United
                    States, loved to travel in the United States. And we'd get into healthy
                    discussions if not arguments.</p>
                <p>But I always felt that they were fair. Usually felt that they were fair. You
                    know, you quickly identified those people who just were not interested in your
                    point of view. They were going to dislike it or disagree with it no matter what
                    it was. You just got used to those people and had less to do with them than with
                    those who were open to a good discussion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was George Bush, Sr. treated there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: I think he was treated well. Of course he and Margaret Thatcher had a
                    very close relationship. As did they both with Henry Catto. Ambassador Catto was
                    very well received in the government in London and I think, if I'm not mistaken,
                    that George Bush and Margaret Thatcher were at Henry Catto's ski lodge in Aspen
                    when word came that Saddam Hussein had invaded Kuwait. I think so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think so. This was when, at a certain point where
                        Thatcher told George not to get involved.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: “It's not a time to go wobbly, George.” That's right. And of course
                    they were our biggest allies in the first Gulf War, clearly. So we had a very
                    close relationship between the two governments. Everybody wants to travel to
                    London, but we calculated, in the first years of the Clinton administration,
                    thawhich would be my second two years in Londothat literally every member of the
                    cabinet came through. Every single member of the American cabinet. For good
                    business reasons, I'm sure. But they all found some reason to come through.
                    There is a whole large section of the embassy devoted to looking after official
                    visitors because it is so important to have them treated well. They just come
                    through non-stop.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any sort of issues during this four years you
                        were therAmerican-British issuethat were really controversial or
                        insolvable?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Um, no not really. The Northern Ireland issue was always a bit of a
                    problem. And we would have from time to time ambassadors in the Republic who
                    felt that they could freelance a bit and maybe move the peace process forward
                    faster than American foreign policy directed, and that would confuse things
                    sometimes in London. And the government in London wouldn't quite be able to
                    figure out what was going on. However, most of the sophisticated people in the
                    Foreign Office understood our system well enough to know what was going on. But
                    that was regularly an issue. There may well have been others, but I just don't
                    remember what they were.</p>
                <p>Of course Margaret Thatcher was turned out of office while I was there. And John
                    Major came in. But again, we dealt of course with whomever the Prime Minister
                    was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From the embassy officers, what was the evaluation you
                        were getting from them about the time of Margaret Thatcher?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Well I think she was a very, obviously, historically strong leader. She
                    was popular. The Labor party had a very hard time gaining any traction because
                    she was such a steamroller in office. But she was thrown out. I think it is
                    broadly felt that she broke the back of the unions. When I was working on Fleet
                    Street in the late '60s early '70s the unions absolutely ruled it then, and the
                    cases of feather bedding were just horrible. There was nothing that the
                    publishers could do about it. And that was spread throughout industry. The
                    automotive industry was famous for it also, as well as all others. And she
                    really did take them, you know, directly on and won, and transformed British
                    society in doing that. Transformed the British economy I think in doing
                    that.</p>
                <p>But I think she was also one of these people that people seem to love to hate.
                    Wildly unpopular in some sectors of British society.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well Oxford never gave her an honorary degree.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Is that right? I hadn't heard that, but I can believe that. The
                    academic community weren't always great supporters of Margaret Thatcher.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Rupert Murdoch or his operation cross your path?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Yes. Well, sort of. I mean he was just starting to really get a hold .
                    . . I'm trying to think of when he bought the Times. He was starting to get a
                    hold. And there was the typical sort of British wariness about a foreigner
                    coming in and having quite so much control. But again there was respect for the
                    fact that he was such a dynamic businessman and had really turned some
                    publications around and made them very profitable. The Times had sort of
                    lumbered along for whatever it wamore than a hundred years as a newspapeand I
                    think he really shook it up and made it a better newspaper. But there was a lot
                    of gnashing of teeth when he did so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then where did you go after this? 1992.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: '94. After London I came back to Washington. It was not my choice. But
                    one of things I learned serving in London is you will never get any respect.
                    It's not a great job for getting promoted because everybody thinks “Oh my God,
                    London” no matter what you say about it being the most frantic posting ever. And
                    they kept offering me posts that I just was not prepared to go to. I remember
                    they desperately needed somebody to go to Kingston, Jamaica to be PAO. And I at
                    that stage had children who were 10 and 14, in elementary and middle school. And
                    I called up the current PAO to find out what was going on. Well, the current
                    PAthe reason there was a vacanchad just curtailed because the schools were so
                    appalling. I said “Well I'm not going to take my family there.” So, I ended up
                    coming back to Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. We'll pick this up in '94 when you were going back
                        to Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Today is the 27th of January 2005. You're off to
                        where now? Back to the States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Yes. 1994. I had sought valiantly another posting abroad but one of the
                    things I learned about London, which I probably said last time we were
                    recording, it was certainly the most exciting assignment I ever had and the
                    hardest work I ever did, but serving in a place like London and maybe
                    particularly London or maybe London and Paris and Rome, you talk about how hard
                    you worked and people roll their eyes and say “Yeah, right.” So there was no
                    chance of getting any sort of decent assignment despite my best efforts. I had
                    kids going off to high school, a daughter getting ready to go off to high
                    school.</p>
                <p>We came back to Washington. And I went to work as the Special Assistant for the
                    Associate Director for Educational and Cultural Affairs. This was when USIA was
                    still of course a separate agency. The Associate Director was the Assistant
                    Secretary level position at USIA. And he was the guy in charge of, as I say,
                    Educational and Cultural Affairs. It is what is now ECA, the job that Assistant
                    Secretary Pat Harrison has.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>And it was an interesting assignment. It wasn't the most fun I've ever had. But
                    what it taught me, as Washington assignments often do, is where all the pieces
                    fit back in Washington. Such an assignment really helps your effectiveness when
                    you are abroad as a Foreign Service Officer to have had time in Washington to
                    see exactly where all the policy making jobs are, how they all fit together, and
                    to make those contacts so that when you are abroad and you need difficult
                    information or a difficult answer you can pick up the phone and know what office
                    to call and in most cases know what person to call. So professionally it was an
                    enormously helpful assignment from that point of view.</p>
                <p>It also taught me for the first time the structure of the ECA, which is what we
                    called at that time the “E Bureau” at USIA. I got used to working with a very
                    high level political appointee. I'd had that in London in that the ambassadors,
                    two of the three ambassadors I served, were political appointees. I think my
                    lasting impression of the job and the time was seeing how the government works
                    through the eyes of a political appointee rather than a career government
                    employed Foreign Service Officer or GS employee, someone who had been 20 years
                    working for the government as a full time employee. Seeing the different
                    relationships . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was this you were working for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: The Associate Director was Jack Loiello.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: He was a political operative in the Democratic Party. I don't know a
                    lot about it. Both parties have offices or projects that do work abroaand I
                    think he was head of, it's not Democrats Abroad, but it's the National
                    Democratic Institute.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah, there's two of them. But basically they are doing
                        the same thing. They are working the same side of the street essentially,
                        promoting democracy, particularly in the newly emerging countries in the
                        Soviet Union . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: That's right. Eastern Europe, that sort of thing. And so I think that's
                    what he had done at one stage. Most of the people I believe in that position
                    before him had come from academia. But he didn't. He came and he was there for,
                    I guess, three or four years, something like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were doing this from when to when, now?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: That was the summer of 1994 until the summer of 1997. And in the spring
                    of 1997 we wanted to go abroad again. I thought it was time. And we looked
                    around and I didn't find an assignment that would fit me and fit my family, so I
                    took some short term assignments, which was a great thing that USIA could do,
                    and I guess the Department does too. But being a smaller agency, USIA had a lot
                    of flexibility in the personnel office. And I did a three or four week stint at
                    the “Summit of the Eight” in Denver. It was when Russia was not a member of the
                    G-they didn't call it the G-8 yet. The called it the “G-7” or the “G-7 plus 1.”
                    So, it wasn't called the G-8 at that stage, and I guess its still not wholly the
                    G-8 because Russia is not part of the economic elements of the G-7. So it was
                    called the “Summit of the Eight.” I had been at the G-7 in London with George
                    Bush, I guess it was, the first George Bush as President, and that was called
                    the “G-7 plus one.” What they did was have several days of meetings as the G-7
                    and then when they finished the economic stuff and got into political matters,
                    then the Russian leader, who I guess was Gorbachev, I'm not sure, joined the
                    gathering.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Probably Yeltsin. It might have been Gorbachev.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Might have been Gorbachev who came to London. Anyway, so in Denver,
                    rather than call it the “G-7 plus one” they called it the “Summit of the Eight”
                    and didn't use the G letter. And I did press work. I was liaison with the
                    British media because I had come out of London most recently overseas. I did
                    that assignment. I did a month assignment at the Ops Center at USIA.</p>
                <p>I did a three week assignment, in Ottawa. There was the famous global anti-mining
                    conference in Ottawa that was very controversial. Our participation was very
                    controversial. And it overlapped with APEC. So the whole embassy had decamped
                    out to Vancouver where APEC was being held to support the President's visit
                    there. And they needed press support in Ottawa, backstop, for the American
                    delegations at the de-mining conference. The USG representatives didn't go as
                    full delegates, we went as observers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I talked to somebody who was involved with thaBob VekofI
                        don't know if you know him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: I know the name.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Bob was saying that he was very skeptical about the
                        de-mining thing. He comes from, I'd say, the liberal side of the spectrum,
                        but said this was a loaded thing. It was designed mainly to embarrass the
                        United States. That actually we've done far more in de-mining than anybody
                        else has. Did you get that feeling?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Yes. I mean I obviously did a lot of reading up on it, having not been
                    familiar with the subject before I went up there. And that's absolutely true.
                    The U.S. spent and gave more money and resources on de-mining than the rest of
                    the world put together. The only sticking point for us were some mines in, I
                    think, Cuba and in Korea, at Guantanamo and on the DMZ in Korea, and both of
                    them were due to be phased out, they were not anti-personnel mines. We were
                    absolutely on the side of the gods. And we felt very strongly that the writers
                    of the proposal could have done an awful lot more to meet us and we could have
                    participated. But there were political reasons why they didn't want to and
                    wanted to feel holier than thou, and wrote the declaration in such a way that we
                    couldn't sign on and everybody knew we couldn't sign on. There was no way we
                    could have signed on. And so we were put in an unhappy camp with, I don't know,
                    Cambodia, Burma, maybe Angola or something. You know, countries where they had
                    serious problems with mines. But technologically, we were streets ahead of
                    everyone else. And in terms of resources and concern about the issue, primarily,
                    no one was doing more or cared more than we did. But it was a politicaI believa
                    political decision on the part of the organizers not to modify the text to allow
                    us to participate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going back to your original job in USIA, this was what
                        now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: '94 to '97. I was Special Assistant to the Associate Director of the
                    Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the bureau doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Well it's a very large bureau, it was one of the two largest at USIA.
                    It runs all of our educational programs abroad, all of our exchanges. As you
                    know, we have an enormous international visitor program where we bring tens of
                    thousands of rising soon-to-be, we hope, influential foreigners to the United
                    States and give them a month tour of this country. It's a most extraordinary
                    project. Costs about ten thousand dollars a head, or more. And for my money,
                    it's the best investment the U.S. government makes in anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh absolutely. I mean anybody who knows anything about it
                        knows how valuable it is. It has such lasting effects.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Yes. It's a life changing experience. They also run all the educational
                    exchanges, the Fulbright program, the Humphrey program, the Eisenhower fellows;
                    all the different educational exchange programs are done by ECA. We had a small
                    arts program where we sent American artists and American art abroad. That was
                    largely closed down by director Joe Duffey before he left. There was then such
                    an outcry that it has now been started back up. We didn't do the speakers
                    program. Speakers were done in the P bureau, what's now called IIP. But we did,
                    as I say, educational and cultural affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Duffey the director when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: People I've talked to, some speak in not very positive
                        terms about Joe Duffey in that he didn't really engage and, two, all sorts
                        of things. He wasn't organized. He didn't know what the program was about.
                        He was basically opposed to it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: He was not USIA's strongest leader. Let me give you an example. What
                    made the initial impression on me was, shortly after he had assumed office as
                    director of USIa very important position in the federal government, at least I
                    think it was and most people in foreign affairs agrehe came to London on a trip.
                    The Voice of America, not surprisingly, and the BBC have semi-annual discussions
                    where they compare notes. A very productive, intelligent thing to do. Well,
                    Director Duffey came for one of these meetings and stayed a week. My first
                    impression was, wait a second, this guy is the brand new head of an enormous
                    organization with crises all over, and he can afford to spend a whole week
                    sitting in London on talks that are useful for maybe a day and a half, but not
                    for five working days?</p>
                <p>And the other thing that struck me was this: he came into the embassy. He had a
                    meeting with the USIS staff at the embassy, all the FSNs and Americans with the
                    director. And he came in with an interesting discussion about the Information
                    Age and a very sort of ethereal, theoretical discussion of foreign policy. I
                    don't know if we called it public diplomacy then, but it was very thoughtfuyou
                    know he had previously been president of American University and it was a very
                    academic, thoughts in the wind type of discussion. And we all left the meeting
                    and thought “Well gee, that's kind of interesting.” And then we came back for
                    another meeting a couple of days later and we thought, “Well he's given us the
                    overall airy, fairy picture, now we are going to get the meat on the bones and
                    here we go.”</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>Well we sat through another hour of this sort of free range thinking about new
                    directions in blah, blah, blah. And there was never any meat there. And
                    certainly my impression was that this guy is probably a brilliant academic, but
                    he certainly doesn't come across as a manager or a person who knows how to run
                    the public diplomacy aspects of American foreign policy. And what's he doing? As
                    nice as London is, what's he doing spending a week here when he's just taken
                    over? So he was, I think, not our strongest leader.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find his influence when you were back in
                        Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: In Washington, very much the same impression. I think he was a pleasant
                    man. I don't think anyonhow do I know? but no one I spoke to really disliked him
                    as a person. He was affable, would smile and shake your hand when he met you. My
                    boss of course reported directly to him. Jack Loiello reported directly to Joe
                    Duffey and I think their relationship was pleasant and friendly. But you just
                    didn't get the impression there was much “there” there. I don't mean he was
                    stupid for a second. But just in terms of this job and being director - what now
                    is considered the Undersecretary for Public Diplomacy - you know it's a tough
                    job with a lot of work to do, on the Hill and in the media, all of our
                    educational programs. I hate to say he wasn't engaged, because I think he
                    probably was engaged. But he wasn't effectively engaged, that was my
                    impression.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And on these other jobs you had?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: I was in the Ops Center. I was in Denver. I was in Ottawa. And then I
                    also did a month's spell imaybe it was three weekin State Public Affairs. That
                    was an interesting experience. They had a unit in EUR, it was called EUR/PPD,
                    something like thait was the policy and press office for EUR. This was during
                    Bosnia, and the White House or the NSC had appointed a lot of special advisors
                    to the President on different aspects of what was going on in Bosnia. So you had
                    in this building a bunch of different people who have senior rank and small
                    offices who felt that they had to have their fingerprints on everything. My job
                    was to develop cleared media guidance. It's now all done electronically, but
                    then it was done with pieces of paper carried around. It's hard to believe that
                    only six or eight years ago. We would get questions from State PA, the front
                    office of Public Affairs, saying “These are the questions that we need answers
                    to by the noon briefing.” My office would get the ones for EUR and we would go
                    through them, and the majority of them were always on Bosnia.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>We then drafted the guidance. We would find the desk, the geographic Desk
                    Officer, and he would come up with some guidance. We would edit it a little bit
                    and then start this tortuous process of taking it around to all these people who
                    felt they were terribly important and only they knew exactly how the guidance
                    should read. So you would have this piece of paper with peopland it wasn't just
                    the people who were the special advisors to the President, but they would bring
                    some political appointees with them, some sort of junior staffers who'd been on
                    the campaign or somethinand they all felt that they had to input. You spent a
                    frantic morning literally walking around this building, from office to office to
                    office, taking guidance, having it cleared by these people, having it amended by
                    these people, then going back to the first people. It was a nightmare. It really
                    was a nightmare. But thank God I only had to do that for three weeks and then
                    they brought somebody else in.</p>
                <p>But what happened is, you came in at five or six in the morning, got the list,
                    started the process, and when you had the final cleared guidance you would take
                    it down and you would sit in front of the Richard Boucher, who at that time was
                    Jamey Rubin or his deputy, and go over it with them so that they were
                    comfortable with it for the noon briefing. And then you would just collapse
                    because it was mentally exhausting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that anything came out of these other than a
                        bureaucratic re-scrambling of the words?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: No. I think I could have sat down with the geographic desk officer in
                    EUR and came up with the guidance. The two of us and it would have been
                    fine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was nobody in the Department's P Bureau who was able
                        to, using a diplomatic term, kick-ass? I mean these people had too much
                        clout with within the . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: I think they did. I mean, this was on a day-by-day, hour-by-hour basis.
                    It wasn't one major event where someone needed to jump in and say “get this done
                    and move on with your life.” This was every day, every single morning. So you
                    couldn't invoke somebody from P. P would have to clear on the guidance always
                    and they were always very quick. You know, all the professional staff, the
                    career GS and Foreign Service staff in the building, knew the system and all
                    were keen to make it work. Occasionally you would have a difficult person, but
                    that was rare. It was these little enclaves of people who had been given a
                    special title and then brought some sort of mid-level political appointees with
                    them, where things would just get stuck. And it was frustrating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So after you finished these little bits and pieces?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: So I did those bits and pieces and then a funny thing happened, also
                    not atypical for the U.S. government, I'm afraid. As a cost-cutting measure,
                    USIA decided to eliminate the position of press officer in Ottawa. Now Ottawand
                    I can go on with this at great length, but I won'it's not the most glamorous
                    capital in the world. But in terms of our relationships abroad, there's just no
                    relationship that is more importannot so much politically, but economically-
                    than Canada. It's crazy. We do a billion dollars a day in trade with Canada. We
                    do more trade with Canada than we do with all fifteen original members of the
                    European Union together. I mean it's just extraordinary. It's an enormous
                    trading relationship. We have a hundred million people crossing the border
                    coming south every year. A hundred million people cross the border going north.
                    It's a very, very complex relationship. And elements of it can to wrong very
                    quickly with very major consequences.</p>
                <p>I always remember reading an article, a statistic I keep in my mind. The example
                    that is most often used is about the automobile industry. Detroit and Windsor
                    and the trucks going back and forth across the bordeI think it's called the
                    Freedom Bridgwith partially constructed cars on them. You know, the body is made
                    in Detroit and then it goes to Windsor to have the engine installed or
                    something, and then it comes back. You know, it moves back and forth. And GM
                    estimateand I saw it in writinthat every time one of their trucks is delayed at
                    the border, for one minutit costs them a million dollars. Well that's just an
                    astonishing statistic. And of course what that includes is all of the ripple
                    effects. Everything slows down. All of their suppliers, the people who make the
                    tires and people who harvest the rubber. It was an extraordinary statistic and
                    drawn as large as possible. But still, a million dollars for one truck being
                    stopped for one minute. So if you haveven before 9/1you have some crisis at the
                    border because of a trade conflict or something, and a border closes for an
                    hour, only, it's catastrophic to many of these big companies. What, I'm trying
                    to say is that the importance of our mission in Canada is very high.</p>
                <p>Canada also has a very large, literate press, most of which is anti-American. The
                    idea that you could not have a press officer there, just give the media to
                    somebody as an additional duty, was kind of silly. They closed the job in the
                    summer of '97. By Thanksgiving of '97 they realized it was a mistake and
                    reopened the position - it was closed I think for four monthand started people
                    bidding on it.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>I was working in EUR, EU as it was called at USIA, and knew the office director.
                    This job all of a sudden popped up, and there weren't that many people who were
                    available for an off-cycle transfer. So I said I couldn't go right then, but I
                    would be able to go in April. One of my firmest convictionand it's not shared by
                    everybody in the Foreign Servicis that I wouldn't take an assignment where I
                    couldn't have my family with me. I have acquaintances who have taken jobs as an
                    ambassador, which is the dream of many Foreign Service Officers, but their
                    family had to stay back in the States. Well, I wouldn't do it. There isn't a
                    job, including being an ambassador, that's worth it to me. So having my kids in
                    schooI wasn't going to pull them out of school in January. And I wasn't going to
                    go to Ottawno matter how close it is to Washingtowithout my family. So we
                    negotiated on this and in the end I went up to Ottawa in April and my family
                    came up in July as soon as school closed. Those three months, actually, were the
                    only time in my 26 and half years in the foreign service that I was not
                    co-located with my family for a substantial period of time. And it convinced me
                    of the correctness of my decisions over the years. I just wouldn't do it.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I took some French language refresher training and then moved up to
                    Ottawa in April of 1998, and my family stayed in Washington on Separate Quarters
                    Allowance, or whatever it's called. And as soon as school finished, I came down,
                    joined them here and then brought them north. It worked out very well personally
                    because the year before, 1997, the year I finished in the E bureau, my mother,
                    who lived in Georgetown, had moved into an assisted living facility in the
                    Washington area. Obviously I didn't want to be somewhere that was three plane
                    flights and 24 hours away. So the job in Ottawa was really a gift. It was
                    certainly not a great career enhancer, being the IO in Ottawa. But it enabled me
                    to be close enough that we could come down and spend long weekends with my
                    mother, which we did regularly until she died in 1999. It was the right
                    assignment for a number of reasons. The proximity to here and it was also a fun
                    job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from 1998?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: 1998 to 2002. Four years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well let's talk about the Canadian press. I know our
                        little organization with our oral histories, a Canadian correspondent here
                        got a hold of our file on Canada. The most innocuous things. But guys were
                        always talking about how sensitive the Canadians were to what Americans did
                        and how it was kind of silly. And this is all of a sudden on the front page:
                        “American diplomats find Canadians sensitive,” or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Canadians are super sensitive. It was interesting, Stu; let me recount
                    a couple of anecdotes that give measure to the relationship. We have a very good
                    friend who was the science and technology officer in Ottawa who served most of
                    his careehe had two or three assignmentin Moscow back before the fall of the
                    Wall. And he said he had never come across anti-Americanism in Moscow as
                    virulent as he experienced in Canada.</p>
                <p>My sister-in-law is British by birth, like my wife, and she and her husband live
                    on a farm north of Toronto. We'd gone up for several years and spent summer
                    vacations with them. Had a very pleasant time. Never noticed this
                    anti-Americanism. If you travel and visit on holiday, you just don't notice it.
                    And in retrospect, I don't know how I couldn't have. But you don't. Until we got
                    there. And then we started experiencing the anti-Americanism. It's rife in the
                    press. And it astonishes most Americans. It certainly astonished us. I could
                    deal with it comfortably because most of my interlocutors were smart media
                    people who knew not to say irritating things . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And also, we're used to dealing with hostile governments
                        anyways.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Absolutely. But the people hit hardest were my wife, who attended
                    university while we were there, and my son, who was in prep school there. And he
                    got this anti-American crap in his prep school every day, from other students,
                    from faculty in the school. And you know, we spent a lot of time thinking about
                    iand I try not to notrying to figure it out. There have been books and books and
                    books written about it. But it's mostly, I think, the “little brother” syndrome.
                    You know, “take me with you when you go to the dance. Take me with you when you
                    go to the movies. You don't pay enough attention to me. You don't respect me.
                    You don't think I'm important enough. You don't care.” And so they will take
                    everything as a slight. Everything. And it rarely is a slight on our part. But
                    if it is, it is unintentional. We don't have anything against Canadians. But
                    their anti-Americanism can be virulent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As press officer, could you have rational discussions
                        about the papers' attitude with the people? Or was it sort of a “this is
                        showbiz” or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Well both. Those whom I knew well and whom I respected, I would lunch
                    with regularly. I tried at least once a week to take some journalist to lunch.
                    And we got to know each other pretty well, would have dinner with our wives and
                    that sort of stuff. And those sorts of people, you could have a talk with. And
                    their usual response waI mean, they are not stupid people; they are not unkind
                    people, basicall“you are being oversensitive to this.” But I wasn't. I mean, if
                    you hear the things that people say, when you first hear them, you think “I must
                    have misheard” or “That person can't have meant what they said. They didn't
                    understand what they were saying.” Well they do, because there is this just
                    virulent anti-Americanism.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>They also think that we don't know them, we don't pay attention, so they can say
                    anything. The most conspicuous example was when Prime Minister Jean Chr�tien's
                    press secretary called President Buswhat did she call him? an idiot or a dolt or
                    something. Some harsh, harsh word that she had no business using about any head
                    of government, and she used it in front of the press. No Canadian was
                    surprisewell, they were a little surprised that she was so stupid to do it where
                    it would become so quickly visiblbut no one was surprised that she said those
                    words, because I do believe that's the way she felt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there during the whole Monica Lewinsky affair.
                        How was that treated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: No. Lewinsky was . . . when was she? Was it '98? Was that the
                    beginning?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think we're on '98.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: That's right, because I was in the ops center. So yes, yes, it was
                    going on. I think probably the Canadians reacted less to that than did other
                    Europeans. But I always remember that periobefore I went to a post like London
                    or Ottawa I went out of my way to meet all of the Washington correspondents for
                    the major bureaus in that countrand I kept in regular touch with all the
                    Canadian bureau chiefs here in Washington, the bureau chiefs for Canadian media
                    in Washington during my time at post. The thing they found most frustrating
                    about the Lewinski matter was not the story itself, but that their editors kept
                    them chained to their desks in Washington as long as Lewinsky was in the news.
                    They couldn't leave Washington and they couldn't try to cover this enormous,
                    magnificent, rich country. They had to cover just Lewinsky. And I'm sure
                    journalists around the world, and American journalists, felt the same way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah. Talk about television and silliness really. You
                        know, nothing like a little sex scandal. It really wasn't that big a
                        deal.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Well, certainly not to the French and the Italians and certain other
                    people.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there sort of key people in the major newspapers, say
                        the editors who were always trying to give it an anti-American press? Did
                        this sell papers or was this how they felt or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: I think all of the above. I think it's the way the felt, many of them.
                    It certainly sells newspapers. There are some newspapers that are more
                    conservative. Of course, Conrad Black started a new newspaper called the
                    National Post and that was much more in synch with American views than was the
                    rest of the print media in Canada, which is largely left wing. But it is what
                    Canadians want to read. They want to believe the worst about us. And any news
                    story, if there are two ways to take it, they will want to take it the way
                    that's negative about the United States and prove their own superiority. They
                    are always going on about how they have free health care. Their health care
                    system is close to a state of collapse, but it is still free.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We have Canadian cousins who spend most of their time
                        running down to Rochester or Baltimore to get things they can't get up
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: That's right. It's ridiculous. When we left, there were something like
                    ten MRI machines in the country. You would have to wait nine months to get an
                    MRI, so everyone would travel across the border to get their health care.</p>
                <p>So the Canadians have this inferiority. You know, they are the little brother.
                    They're one-tenth our population. They like to say that we don't know anything
                    about Canada. But I came to the firm conclusion that they don't know any more
                    about us than we know about them. They know about Washington. They know about
                    Florida, where they spend their summers. And that's about all they know about.
                    Or the border states.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: That's right. Snowbirds, as they call them,. I always remember, there
                    was one campaign: the U.S. had done something which the Canadians interpreted as
                    being egregiously anti-Canadiaand someone tried to start a campaign to stop
                    snowbirds from flying to Florida for the winter. Well, good luck. They want to
                    be down there, just like we do, in the warm weather. I think practicality trumps
                    politics.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Cuba seems to be the designated neuralgic point that the
                        Canadians keep making a big deal about. They know how to deal with the
                        Cubans. I mean, Chr�tien went down there, maybe during your time, and made a
                        bunch of requests and all he got was a raspberry from Castro.</hi>

                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Yes. I think they think it's an easy one to do. It's one again where
                    they can disagree with us for very little cost. A lot of Canadians don't realize
                    what's going on on the island. They go to Cuban resorts. You know, you can go to
                    a Cuban resort for dirt cheap fees and have a wonderful time on a sunny beach,
                    not realizing quite what the dictatorship is doing on the rest of the island. So
                    yes, they think it's a no cost thing on which they can disagree with us and show
                    their moral superiority. But Chr�tien, yeah, accomplished nothing by going
                    there.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Helms-Burton.</p>

                <p>SHINKMAN: Well I was in place during Helms-Burton.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that have any effect. I mean it was basically aimed
                        against Canadians.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Well, yes. It was quite strictly applied, to foreign firms which took
                    advantage of American assets that had been taken over by the Cuban government in
                    Cuba. There were more stringent aspects to the act which the President waives
                    each year which are not applied. But the elements of the act which do apply were
                    fairly limited. There was one company called Sheerin, or something like that,
                    that had moved into an office building and was using the assets of an American
                    corporation that had been taken over by the Cuban government. And so we took
                    them to task about that. We may have even closed down some of their business in
                    the U.S. Some actions were taken, but they were not a lot. It wasn't a big
                    thing. But it gave the Cubans a soap box to stand on and say how they were being
                    more tolerant and understanding than we were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you notice a difference between, say, Ontario, which
                        I'm told is the seat of this anti-Americanism, and then when you get out to
                        Saskatchewan and Manitoba? It's a whole different world.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Absolutely. I think there is sort of an axis from Ottawa to Toronto,
                    which is the focus of this anti-Americanism. But when you get to the MaritimeI
                    traveled as much as I could because it's a beautiful countrI didn't find it as
                    much. You get out to Calgary, the oil patch, there are just hard charging
                    businessmen who are either assigned to Calgary or to Houston and they move back
                    and forth, or somewhere in the Middle East, and they just want to get on and do
                    business. And you don't find it nearly as much in the press there. You find it
                    to a certain extent, but not nearly as much in the press. Or in public discourse
                    in Vancouver, British Columbia on the West Coast and Saskatchewan and Alberta,
                    or in the Maritimes. And less actually in the Francophone regions, in Quebec.
                    Quebec is sort of odd because they always want to be different. There's a line
                    about “the enemy of my enemy is my friend.” They felt a certain association with
                    us because they disliked the central government in Canada in Ottawa. So there's
                    a funny sort of triangle. But the French Canadians could also be difficult if
                    they wanted to, be superior.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well I would think that with the French Canadians you
                        would run into the mirror of the French intellectuals.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: A certain amount. But thinking about intellectuals, the other thing you
                    come across the more you spend time in Canada is the number of Americans there
                    who have been there a long time, many of them in academia and in the media, who
                    went to Canada during the Vietnam War. It's a long time ago. But there are
                    people who, maybe in their early twenties in 1973, moved to Canada. Say they
                    were born in '53, they would now be in their middle 50s, or early 50s. (Is that
                    right? Am I doing my arithmetic right? Something like that). And who have
                    burrowed in. Do not readily identify themselves as Americans. Want to bI don't
                    know if they want to bbut it appears that they would like to be taken as just
                    another Canadian. And you start slowly to find out that some of these people are
                    American, or American by birth and probably still American citizens. I think
                    particularly in academia there is a strong influence from expatriate Americans
                    who have been teaching up there since they fled the United States in the '70s.
                    That's still an influence. That will wane over time, but I don't think it's
                    waning yet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Showing sort of the American bias, did we really care
                        about this anti-Americanism? Or was this a funny quirk of these people to
                        the north and what the hell?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: It's what my mom called when we were children an “attention getting
                    dodge.” It's an attempt to get our attention. And we don't really care. I
                    remember going to a talk where someone said that the Mexicans and Canadians
                    vastly overestimate how important they are to us. Yet they're just not. There is
                    the very important business and trade relationship. And that really is terribly
                    important. It's actually much more important economically to them than it is to
                    us.</p>

                        people think has nothing to do with business.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Yes. Eighty-five percent of their exports come to the United States.
                    Well that's just an overwhelming dependence of one country on another. Something
                    over forty percent of their GDP is in products that travel south across the
                    border. So, politically the country may not be that important to us. Why they
                    should still be in the G-8 is a major question I think that people ask. I don't
                    think countries will be removed from the G-8, but it makes you wonder.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are they that big a commercial power to be there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Where are they? I don't know where they are in the world. They've just
                    been partners with us. I mean, it is an extraordinary successful relationship.
                    It works extremely well. When I say that there are a hundred million people
                    crossing the border each direction every year, almost all those crossings go
                    effortlessly, almost seamlessly. There is hardly ever a problem. So the
                    relationship works very well. They are members with us in NATO. They are, of
                    course, UN members. They're in the OAS with us. They are in many associations
                    with us and so they are important allies in those fields. And there are ways
                    that they can and are helpful to us in those forums, like the OAS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's take an example. Say as press officer at country

                        Mail has a nasty article. Would the ambassador pound and say “How dare they
                        say that?” or was it just sort of shrug . . .</hi>

                <p>SHINKMAN: You have to let it roll off your back, unless it's factually wrong or
                    really egregious. But the number of times that the ambassadoand we would
                    generally not do letters to the editor, because I don't think ambassadors should
                    do letters to the editor - but we would do an op ed piece and say to the
                    newspaper “Would you run this because we think your view on this is out of whack
                    with reality?” But that would happen maybe not more than maybe a couple times a
                    year. The rest of the time you just let it sort of roll off your back. I would
                    call up journalists occasionally and say “This really is wacky stuff” and we
                    would chat about it a while. And I would hope I made some impact that way. But

                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Well a lot of them belonged to chains. There is a large chain that used
                    to be called the Southam newspapers. I'm not sure if it's still called Southam
                    or not. There are very few large independent newspapers. The Toronto Star is
                    one, and that's actually the largest circulation newspaper in the country, but
                    almost all of its circulation is in Toronto. And then The Globe and Mail of
                    course has national coverage. But most of the other papers in Calgary or in
                    Vancouver or in Halifax are part of a chain, so they get their news from the
                    same set of sources. And they hew pretty much to the same line.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was our ambassador while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: I had two ambassadors. Gordon Giffen was the ambassador when I arrived.
                    He was a corporate lawyer from Atlanta. Very smart guy who had been very active
                    in the second Clinton campaign. Was credited with having won Georgia for
                    President Clinton, and he was given the posting. Did an exceptionally good job.
                    Good to work with. I enjoyed working with him very much. Very bright guy. Very
                    sensitive. He had actually been raised in Canada. His father was, I think, an
                    insurance executive for one of the multinational insurance companies and had
                    been in Toronto when Ambassador Giffen was in school.</p>
                <p>But he was alsgiven his background as a political operative here in the Statehe
                    was very much as a behind the scenes kind of guy. He didn't do a lot of public
                    speaking. He was good at it when he did it, but I never felt he was comfortable
                    doing it. He wasn't a comfortable schmoozer. He had excellent connections in the
                    government, knew all the people he needed to know and was very effective in
                    dealing with them, but kept a lower profile.</p>
                <p>After President Bush was elected, for my last year there, he sent up Paul
                    Cellucci, the former governor of Massachusetts, to be ambassador, and he had had
                    decades in public office and was much more comfortable in that sort of
                    environment. He also did a brilliant job and is still doing a brilliant job as
                    ambassador, but with a much, much more public face. Gave a lot more speeches.
                    Was in the news a lot more, because he was comfortable in that environment. And
                    as I said, he did an exceptionally strong job managing this awkward, enormous,
                    relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were speeches by the ambassador, other than
                        trade?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: They were received fairly well. Ambassador Cellucci was much more
                    outspoken than Ambassador Giffen was. He said repeatedly in publithat his
                    marching orders from the President when he came to Canada consisted of just one
                    item, which was: Tell the Canadians they need to spend more on defense. They had
                    cut back and back and back, so they had hollowed out their defense structure.
                    They had, you know, peacekeepers here and there, but really had hollowed out the
                    military.</p>
                <p>So Ambassador Cellucci delivered that message repeatedly, effectively, politely
                    but clearly. And that of course hit the press. And of course the immediate
                    reaction was outrage - “Who is this man to come and tell us what we should be
                    doing?” But he was, as I say, always thoughtful, never harangued anybody, and
                    presented the case about why Canada needed to do this. If Canada wanted to be a
                    world player, then it needed to invest and not rely entirely on the United
                    States for its military defense. It needs to have some sort of a defense
                    program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The time you are talking about, Canada really had a couple
                        of battalions that would go for peacekeeping and, from what I gather, they
                        made a big deal about this. Essentially, they really didn't have much of an
                        armed force.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: They didn't. And of course they'd have to rely on us to transport their
                    forces overseas. They really, really, haJean Chr�tien hareally hollowed out the
                    Canadian military. And it was a shame because they have a fine military and a
                    proud heritage. I always remember when General Anthony Zinni, the guy used to be
                    commandant of the Marine Corps, he came up for a talk that I went to. And of
                    course Canadians had become famous as peacekeepers, and still do a fine job as
                    peacekeepers, the Canadian forces. But Zinni told their Ministry of Defense in
                    speeches that they needed to make a decision. If they wanted to be peacekeepers,
                    that's fine, and that's what they will be. But they cannot be both a war
                    fighting military structure and be peacekeepers, because they are very, very
                    different roles and you can't train for both at the same time. You will lose
                    your effectiveness as a military force if. That's entirely a decision for the
                    Canadians to make, but they need to make that decision and not think they can
                    fill both roles at once because they can't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any crises that you had to deal with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: The major one, of course, was 9/11. And the outpouring from the
                    Canadians was just extraordinary. I mean, the outpourings of sympathy and
                    support. It was just a crazy time in the press office. I was in the office
                    almost 24 hours a day for at least the first week. You know, there were
                    countless offers of support. But there was a classic example. You know, we have
                    so much that is similar about the two of us, living in the same continent and
                    speaking the same language. We have a lot of similarities and the Canadians
                    admire the United States in some ways if you get them privately, alone. But the
                    offers to help were extraordinary.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>If you remember, briefly, all the flights that were in the air, coming across the
                    Atlantic, were told they could not come into the United States. Many of them, of
                    course, were beyond the point of no return and could not fly back to Europe. So
                    they all landed on the east and west coasts of Canada. Canada opened up all
                    these old airportthere are amazing photographs of old runways, with weeds in
                    them because they had been shut down Air Force Bases, with gleaming 747s and
                    767s lined up along side them. Thirty thousand foreigners, mostly Americans,
                    landed suddenly in these places ... in these remote outposts in Newfoundland and
                    other places. And the travelers were to be put up in whatever remained of an
                    airport or at a gymnasium or whatever. Well Canadians all got in their cars,
                    drove out to the airports, and said “We want to bring these people back to our
                    homes and they can stay in our guest rooms and we'll feed them.” There was such
                    an outpouring of affection and support that way that we ran out of Americans to
                    give them. We had more offers of help than we had people who needed help.</p>
                <p>So the Canadians can come througclearly they can come througwhen the situation
                    calls for it. You would have the occasionaas you did in every country, and I
                    suppose even in this countryou had the occasional rabid left winger who would
                    say “Well, America had it coming to them.” But that was really, really rare in
                    the early months after 9/11.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you seeing a concern at the timwouldn't be
                        particularly in your bailiwick, but you were therin Islamic
                        fundamentalism?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Not very much. The main way that came up was that there has always been
                    a feeling that the border with Canada is porous, and that terrorists would come
                    into Canadbecause their immigration rules are less strict than ourand then slip
                    across the border (tape over, change tape). But there are large Muslim
                    communities in Toronto and to a certain extent in Montreal, but, at least then,
                    Islamic fundamentalism wasn't a major influence that anyone was worried about
                    more than in the Muslim community in Chicago or somewhere like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the universitieyou mentioned that there is this solid

                        Did that reflect itself in American studies or anything else like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: An amazing fact that used to always astonish me: you could not get a
                    degree in Canada in any Canadian universitwell now you can, in Simon Frazier
                    Universita degree in American studies. Now, you would have thought it was the
                    most logical subject for a major other than math or something to have American
                    Studies because nothing could be more important to Canada than their
                    relationship with the United States. Clearly. But you could not major in
                    American studies. So I think that partly answers the question, that academia
                    doesn't want to study the relationship as seriously as they should.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just as a last thing, what about your son at prep school?
                        What sort of things was he getting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: I'll give you two quick examples and we can discuss it more next time.
                    He came home from school one day and said that his history teacher had taught
                    the class that the American constitution was a racist document. I said “My God,
                    what are you talking about?” Well, I know what he was talking about, the clauses
                    that say that an African American is three-fifths of a man. And I called the
                    teacher absolutely outraged and I said “That's an element of our history that we
                    have been struggling with for 250 years and doing darn well on, making progress
                    on. It's something that no one thinks is right. They did at the time. No one in
                    their right mind today certainly thinks of it as supportable. We've been working
                    to correct it. To call the document, which is one of the most liberating
                    documents in the history of the world, along with the Magna Carta perhaps, to
                    call it a racist document to teenagers when you know that they're just taking
                    shorthand notes in their notebook is highly irresponsible. The students are
                    going to write 'U.S. constitution = racist' and they are not going to put any
                    context. And racist is such a late 20th century, early 21st century adjective,
                    that it's just not right.” And the guwe had a nice talsaid he completely
                    understood my point of view and said he would stop teaching it.</p>
                <p>The other one, where I was less successful, was where a social studies teacher
                    had taught in Paul's class that American treatment of blacks was equivalent to
                    Hitler's treatment of the Jews. And I was absolutely outraged. I called her, and
                    I said “How can you say that? There is a history of abuse and segregation that
                    we have been struggling to improve and have improved and continue to work to
                    improve for generations. Comparing that to a system that was set up to eliminate
                    a race of people, that's so unfair it's just not right.” She was, in fact, from
                    a family that had survived the holocaust, which made it all the more bizarre to
                    me. She was not to be moved. She said “Nope.” She said it was genocide or, I
                    don't know what noun she used, but . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well was this a regular school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: It was a very elite prep school. It was the smartest prep school in
                    Ottawa, called Ashbury.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to sort of make this stand known to the
                        authorities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: We did. And they were very responsive. The administration was very
                    responsive. We met with the headmaster individually, my wife and I. And we met
                    with their counselor, who was, interestingly, a Ghanaian-Canadian. Brilliant
                    guy, very respected by the students. And both of them were very effective. The
                    headmaster called a student assembly and talked to them about anti-Americanism.
                    And obviously most of the bile that these kids were laying on my son was stuff
                    that they brought from home. You know, the kids didn't think this stuff up. So
                    the administration was very responsive. The teachers, as I've demonstrated, some
                    of them were responsive, some of them weren't. And it was hard on my son.</p>
                <p>It was the only time, Stu, in my whole career, when I came close to curtailing an
                    assignment. One night when my son came home with one of these outrageous
                    stories, my wife and I talked about it and I said to Paul at dinner, “If you
                    want to leave here, I'll put in my papers tomorrow. Even if I have to resign
                    from the Foreign Service, I'm not going to have you subjected to this.” He said,
                    “Let me think about it overnight.” He was only sixteen at the time. And in the
                    morning he said “You know, I'm not going to let them chase me away.” He worked
                    with a counselor and was taught some good ways to deal with this stuff. And he
                    formed a group of friends who were not that way and he got through it and had a
                    happy senior year. But his junior year was very difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, well we'll call it off at this point. Is there
                        anything more we should cover in Canada?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: I don't think so. I think the anti-Americanism is the thing and I hate
                    to have that sound like the focus, because I enjoyed my tour there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, no, no. But there is something there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Oh absolutely, and it colors your whole experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you talked about 9/11.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: And the border, and the relationship. If it's of any interest we could
                    talk about the new embassy building, which was a beautiful new building. But
                    that may not be appropriate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well we could talk about the new embassy building. And
                        then, you left in two-thousand and . . . ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Two.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And also you might talk about the initial problems of
                        dealing with the new Bush, Jr. administration, which were rough all over the
                        world.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: That, and consolidation of USIA into the State Department. That's an
                    interesting subject too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll pick up those and then after that we'll go onto
                        where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Well, now, I guess.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where you are now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Yes. Well, I came back and worked for WHA (Western Hemisphere Affairs)
                    in Public Diplomacy for two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. So we'll do that then. Great.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, Buck, today is the 29th of March 2005. We're talking
                        about Canada. We didn't talk about 9/11 last time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: I think we did, and the extraordinary outpouring of support from the
                    Canadians. They really did a remarkable job. Ambassador Cellucci either has just
                    left Ottawa this week or two. I was reading remarks that he delivered up in
                    Ottawa recentlhe said that by far the strongest memory he will take was coming
                    out of the parliament building when he was about to address a gathering on the
                    Friday after 9/11. (which was a Tuesday) and coming out of the building and
                    seeing something like a hundred thousand people gathered on the lawns and down
                    side streets in the center of Ottawa. It was just astonishing, absolutely
                    astonishing. The Canadians were enormously supportive.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>But the other thing I mentioned at the end of the previous tape was talking about
                    the new embassy building, and that's kind of interesting for various reasons,
                    particularly post-9/11. Of course, it was built before 9/11 but it had opened
                    during the Clinton years. President Clinton came to open it. We did a fair
                    amount of research and seem to have proven that it was the first new embassy
                    building in the history of the republic that was opened by a sitting president.
                    That was a reflection of the importance of the Canadian relationship, as we
                    constantly told the Canadians. Also, not coincidentally, the ambassador at the
                    time, Gordon Giffen, a corporate lawyer from Atlanta, a very effective
                    ambassador, was a good friend of President Clinton and asked him to come up and
                    open it.</p>
                <p>It is a beautiful building designed by a New York architecture firm, built by
                    Canadians, as is the form of these things. David Childs was the lead architect.
                    What I found fascinating was, it's a massive looking building. Could easily be
                    described as a fortress, but I don't think that's fair to it. What I found
                    interesting is that, I got up there in the summer of '98. I think ground had
                    been broken in the spring of '97. And we opened it in the fall of '99. So I had
                    a year there at post during the second half of the construction of the project.
                    As part of our public diplomacy outreach we got David Childs to come up from New
                    York regularlwell he came up for other reasons, tobut he would meet with the
                    press and give tours of the building to architects, local government officials,
                    to the media to try to introduce the building to the community, because it has a
                    very prominent position in the middle of downtown Ottawa. It was interesting
                    during those tours to learn from the lead architect himself all the
                    architectural details, what went into the design of the building, how hard he
                    worked to make it match its environment, fit the environmenwhich I think it did
                    remarkably welbut sill meet the security concerns of the end of the 20th century
                    and early 21st century.</p>
                <p>It's a fascinating building. There were Canadians, of course, who were determined
                    to dislike it. It didn't matter what it looked like. It could have looked like a
                    Disneyland castle and they would have thought it was ugly. But most people I
                    think came to like it. And as I said, the more we talked about it and the more
                    we demonstrated how it had been designed to complement its very historic central
                    location in Ottawa, I think the more acceptance there was of it. There is an
                    analogous situation with the Canadian embassy here in Washington, which, as you
                    know, has it's own unique location on Pennsylvania Avenue between the capital
                    and the White House, where there are no other embassies. It's big. It's a
                    distinctive shape and has a very distinct, unique location.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the border situation? Was there something you
                        said you wanted to talk about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: I think I may have touched on it in the context of 9/11, what a
                    dramatic border it is. The fact that there arand you'll excuse me if I repeat
                    statistica hundred million people who cross the border in each direction every
                    year. Two-hundred million border crossings is just an astonishing number. More
                    than a billion dollars in trade a day crosses the border. It's more than 400
                    billion, I believe, a year. It's probably still true, but when the EU was just
                    15 nations, we did more trade with Canada than we did with all of the EU nations
                    together. As a matter of fact, I think Ontario, the province of Ontario by
                    itself is our nation's 8th largest trading partner. I think that's correct,
                    which is a remarkable statement.</p>
                <p>So the border is very, very important. And I will always remember a statistiand I
                    think I probably gave it beforbut it is so memorable I will run the risk of
                    repeating it. I remember reading an article in the newspaper about General
                    Motors who said that when the flow of commerce for their trucks going across the
                    borders taking partially assembled automobiles back across to different plants
                    that straddle the border, or in cities straddling the border, that every minute
                    a truck gets stopped costs them a million dollars in the ripple effect of all
                    related associated costs. Now that's a pretty staggering figure. So the pressure
                    to keep that border flowing in the harsh new security environment of post-9/11,
                    it's an enormous challenge and it's one that both governments worked on very,
                    very hard, and I think have done a good job on. But it's hard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we talk the last time about the immigrant community in
                        Canada?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: I don't recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anything there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: I can talk a little bit about it. The Canadians are always trying to
                    find ways of differentiating themselves from us. I may have harped on this
                    before. Its sometimes useful, but often just silly. They like to say that
                    they're not a melting pot, they're a tapestry, I think is the phrase they use.
                    Of course immigrants arlike they are in the U.S. but to a much greater extenare
                    extremely important to the economy of Canada because they don't have enough
                    people. And as the economy grows, they need more people to do stuff. It is not a
                    very well populated country. It has about 25 million people, and it's an
                    enormous country with a big thriving economy. But their immigrants do seem to
                    stay in enclaves.</p>
                <p>Now that's a very broad generalization which, of course, could immediately be
                    disproven I'm sure by statisticians, but that was my impression. Most of the
                    immigrants are in the major cities, in Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal. They
                    have large Muslim communities in those cities, but its my impression, a very
                    small number of immigrants outside those three major, major metropolitan
                    areas.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they come at us one way or another?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Not that I recall. You know, right after 9/11 there was a theory that
                    some of the hijackers had come across the border from Canada. And some member of
                    the U.S. Congress said something about the “porous border” and that sort of
                    stuff. But any time you prove something like that, you can find evidence of the
                    opposite, that it was a Muslim or an Islamic terrorist who had come into this
                    country on a Fulbright grant and stayed here. So it's really hard for either
                    side to point a finger at the other because each is wrestling with the same sort
                    of situation. It does seem to be easier to get into Canada than into the United
                    States, A. And B, that doesn't seem to make much difference in terms of the
                    border and security.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 2001, George W. Bush became president and he got into
                        confrontations with just about every country. But how was hiI'm talking
                        about the administratiohis stance with the Canadians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Well, we were very blessed with having a singularly successful and
                    capable ambassador in the person of Paul Cellucci, former governor of the state
                    of Massachusetts, former deputy governor and member of, I think, both of the
                    legislative bodies in Massachusetts. He was an old contact of President Bush's
                    from the time when they were both governors, through the National Governors
                    Conference, along with Tom Ridge, also, the three of them. The President used to
                    joke that all three of them married librarians, which is true, and all married
                    above their station and above their intellect. It was a nice little gentle
                    joke.</p>
                <p>Anyway, Paul Cellucci was a good friend of the President and had been so for many
                    years. He was also being a very accomplished politician, in the best sense of
                    the word, was really good at handling the Canadians. He knew how to speak
                    effectively, openly, not in a challenging way, but directly to the Canadians.
                    His predecessor, Gordon Giffen, had been very effective also, but in a much more
                    behind the scenes way, working with Members of Parliament and the government.
                    Ambassador Cellucci was very good at getting out and speaking publicly. He
                    really had a dramatic effect in terms of raising the profile of the embassy and
                    of the ambassadorship, and I think went a long way to smoothing what might
                    otherwise have been some ruffled feathers.</p>
                <p>So I didn't feel that things took a real turn for the worse or anything like that
                    when the Bush administration came in. His policiePresident Bush's policiewere
                    presented properly and clearly by Ambassador Cellucci, and it was accepted that
                    there might have been a difference of opinion if there was a difference but this
                    was, not a crazy, gun slinging president. That sort of stuff, I think, you will
                    find everywhere and it was certainly present, but it wasn't prevalent. I think
                    the ambassador did an exceptionally good job of explaining President Bush's
                    policies clearly. So we didn't have that many troubles.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you have a problem in dealing with the press? I
                        mean, were they gunning for . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: I didn't. Obviously as press spokesman at the embassy I got to know all
                    the press very well. And there were some who were determined to be against our
                    policies no matter what. But not very many of those. Conrad Blacformer owner of
                    the Daily Telegraph in Londohad started a new national newspaper called the
                    National Post, which was largely pro-American, as is Conrad Black. That was a
                    help to us. The Globe and Mail is the other prominent newspapethey have just a
                    couple of newspapers which really are national, which are sold and read across
                    the country. The Globe and Mail was generally more skeptical about a Republican
                    administration. And that was predictable. But I always felt that most of the
                    journalists were well educated and gave us a fair shot.</p>
                <p>Occasionally you would see columnists, and usually not regular columnists but
                    guest columnists, who would right crazy stuff, I mean just outrageous stuff. And
                    when we saw it published in a generally respectable newspaper, it really was
                    quite startling. There was a famous article that I've probably got tucked away
                    at home somewhere, a column by a womashe might even have been a Member of
                    Parliament, I'm not surand the theme of it was something along the lines of:
                    “Americans, don't you hate the bastards?” I think that was the phrase she used.
                    Or, “I really hate the bastards” or something like that. This was in a national
                    newspaper. It was absolutely appalling. But they get away with that because they
                    thinand I'm sure I said this before in this tape about my time in Canadthey
                    think it doesn't matter. They think that Americans won't notice because we just
                    generally don't notice them, which is true in some regards, and so they can say
                    the most outrageous things.</p>
                <p>As I mentioned earlier, the Prime Minister's press spokesman was caught by a
                    journalist calling President Bush a moron. Now she didn't realize she was
                    speaking to the press, but just the fact that a press spokesman from the head of
                    government could be so incautious under any circumstances as to call, not just
                    the head of state of another government, but the head of state of the United
                    States, a moron was just unbelievable.</p>

                <p>SHINKMAN: Well, not really. That was an internal Canadian matter. We wouldn't
                    respond to something like that. She got the sack immediately even though she had
                    been a press spokesman for the Prime Minister for years and years. She was very
                    highly regarded by him. But once that happened, she had to go. And she went.</p>

                    yes, they have some pretty far left wing politicians there and you do
                    occasionally get some craziness like that. I don't remember hearing that often,

                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Well, there was a visit that was supposed to be on that had to be
                    postponed. Relations between President Bush and Prime Minister Chr�tien were not
                    particularly good. Chr�tien seemed to have gotten along pretty well with
                    President Clinton, but he and Bush didn't hit it off particularly well. And
                    there were some thingas I've commented beforthe Canadians would look for ways to
                    kind of thumb their nose at us, and they thought that it really didn't matter.
                    Cuba was the most conspicuous example. They would cozy up to the Cubans knowing
                    full well that that sent large percentages of the American electorate
                    ballistic.</p>
                <p>Bush and Chr�tien were not great pals and were clearly not destined to be. There
                    was I think at least one visit that was postponed, it might have been by the
                    Secretary of State or it might have been by the President, just to generally
                    acknowledge, not verbally of course, that it was because we were a little ticked
                    off and they had just been a little too stupid in saying these things that they
                    thought they could get away with cost-free, which, of course, were not
                    cost-free.</p>

                <p>SHINKMAN: Oh, okay. I think it was the NSC (National Security Council). I think
                    there were people in the NSC who were watching this who said privately to
                    themselves and in the confines of the NSC, “You know, we don't have to put up
                    with this stuff. They can say whatever they want, but there's going to be a
                    price.” I don't think it was the Department as much. That was my impression. I
                    think it was the NSC.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: I came back to Washington. I was callealways very flatterinby a woman
                    who a Foreign Service Officer I had enormous respect for, Betsy Whitaker, who
                    was the office director for WHA Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs, what we
                    used to call in USIA the Area Office. She needed a deputy and she called me and
                    asked me whether I would bid on the job. Of course I was very flattered to be
                    asked and did bid on the job and got the job.</p>
                <p>I had not served in WHA before except that, during the time I was in Canada,
                    Madeleine Albright decided that the Department was going to move Canada from EUR
                    to what became WHA. (Before that it was ARA, of course.) So my experience in WHA
                    was thrust upon me rather than my choice. It was a new area of the world for me.
                    And I had a wonderful year with her and then she was replaced by a guy called
                    Bill Bach. I had a very successful two years as the Deputy Area Director,
                    spending most of my time with an office of, I guess, fifteen or twenty people,
                    supporting the public affairs sections at embassies throughout the
                    hemisphere.</p>
                <p>I spent a lot of time traveling in the hemisphere. I think I got to sixteen or
                    eighteen countries in the two years. Almost all of the countries I had never
                    been to in my life. And it really is a unique experience to visit a city like
                    Port-au-Prince, Haiti. It's really an experience, particularly for an American,
                    particularly for an American diplomat, to visit a city like Havana, Cuba. And
                    then to get way down into the southern cone and the Andean countries. And
                    Central America. I found it fascinating and interesting, and hope that I had a
                    positive effect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feel for how we were presenting
                        ourselves, because after 9/11 and all, there was great concern about how we
                        were dealing with the Arabs, but how about with Latin America or the Western
                        Hemisphere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: You know, it had been years since we had had a confirmed Assistant
                    Secretary of State for WHA or ARA, before Roger Noriega became [Assistant]
                    Secretary of State. Before him we had an Acting Assisting Secretary of State in
                    Curt Struble, a career Foreign Service Officer. He was acting because before him
                    was Acting Assistant Secretary of State Otto Reich, who was, for reasons more
                    complicated than I can explain, unconfirmable on Capital Hill. He was Acting
                    Assistant Secretary for a year, I guess. Before him we had Peter Romero, career

                    whatever reason not confirmable. So you have to go back quite a few years to
                    find a confirmed Assistant Secretary of State for ARA or WHA.</p>

                <p>I think that caused and continues to cause a certain amount of comment that
                    that's not coincidence, that that reflects a lack of attention by the U.S.
                    federal government to affairs in this hemisphere. And of course Assistant
                    Secretary Noriega has faced that charge also. He has done a lot to reverse that
                    view, but it is a view that was widely held, that we are not paying attention.
                    It's kind of ironic for me to come from a country like Canada, which is obsessed
                    with the idea that we don't pay enough attention to them, to move into a whole
                    area where peoplnot quite such an obsession, but there is the widespread feeling
                    that we don't do enough.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feealthough I realize you had a hemisphere
                        wide mandatfor the wedding of Canada into the ARA, or now WHA tub? In a way,
                        I would think they would be much more comfortable in Europe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: I think Canadians would feel that way. I think some of the thunder,
                    however, was stolen by the fact that they lumped us geographically in their
                    foreign ministry in this hemisphere. Of course it's not an exactly analogous
                    situation. Of course that sort of move is invisible to 99.9 percent of the
                    population. So I think among pundits in the newspapers, some said, “Well, here
                    we are being relegated to another backwater. It just confirms what I've always
                    said, that the Americans don't have enough respect for us or pay enough
                    attention to us.” But I don't think it caused much of a fuss. And as I said, the
                    rejoinder always was that they treated us in a reciprocal way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah. So you could always say, “We have to treat you with
                        the same amount of concern Argentina or Uruguay too.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: That would win their hearts immediately. But it does make a certain
                    amount of sense. I mean, Canada is an odd country out in the Western Hemisphere
                    context, but it is a Western Hemisphere country. They are very active in the OAS
                    with us. They can have influence in a lot of forums that we can't. They are a
                    useful ally and partner. And I think they can be very helpful to us when they
                    want to be. So I don't think it was a mistake. Having served an awful lot in
                    Western Europe, I think fits in Western Europe better too, but I don't think
                    it's a big deal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about - during the time you were here in Washington
                        herdealing with Cuba? How did that go?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: My dealings with Cuba, which have been very few, as with most people,
                    really started when I was in Canada because that was one of the issues where
                    they really do differ with us. It's a conscious decision on their part. And at
                    one stage the prime minister, Jean Chr�tien, was going to Havana, and the media
                    wanted our reaction. I knew enough, having followed Cuban policy at a distance
                    over the years, to know that the subject of Cuba in the U.S. government is
                    absolutely toxic. And no matter what you do, probably you are going to set a
                    foot wrong as far as someone is concerned. You need to be really, really
                    careful. Careers have been made, brokemore broken than madjust by brushing up
                    against Cuban policy.</p>
                <p>I wanted to be responsive because it was sort of a poke in our eye for Jean
                    Chr�tien - I mean the Prime Minister for heaven's sakto go down to Cuba. So I
                    got some policy from the Office of Cuban Affairs and I wrote it on a poster
                    board, like this one right here, or an easel. I told the camera crew from the TV
                    station, from CBC I guess it was, I said “Here are the questions I'm prepared to
                    answer. You can ask me these questions. If you ask me anything else, I'm not
                    going to be able to answer.” And then I wrote out the answers for myself to make
                    sure I got the words, which had been cleared back here in Washington, right. I
                    had the TV cameras stand next to the poster board so that when they asked me a
                    question I could look thoughtful and glance off camera, as if I was sort of
                    marshalling my thoughts, when what I was actually doing was reading the text to
                    make sure I got it exactly right because I was going to be darned if I was going
                    to step off the reservation. And that was the interview I did on Cuba.</p>
                <p>Since coming back to Washington, I have developed enormous admiration for our
                    diplomats who work in Havana. It's a horrible, hostile environment. Castro is a
                    master at portraying himself as a fuzzy old bear anachronism of a 1950's
                    revolutionary, when he is of course a harsh dictator. You know, was it two years
                    ago or three when they locked up dozens of so called dissidents for things like
                    having a typewriter that wasn't registered with the local police. It was
                    fascinating, my trip there. I mean I really, really enjoyed it because it was so
                    eye opening.</p>
                <p>I remember talking with an embassy officer who was from the LEGATT Office, the
                    legal attach�. The Cubans were cooperating with us, for some reasons that are
                    still murky but you never will know, on a pedophile case. One of these horrible
                    international stories about child abuse. And the LEGATT needed to talk to a
                    Cuban. So with the Cuban police he went to the neighborhood and they found the
                    local party neighborhood block captain. They said “We need to talk to so-and-so
                    in this apartment.” The block captain said “Oh, okay.” And he went over to a
                    cabinet on the wall, opened it up, and it was a key cabinet. And he took out a
                    key to that apartment. And they went to that apartment and he opened the front
                    door and in they went. The block captain had a key to the front door of every
                    property on the block. Just mind-boggling intrusion of government into private
                    lives. Absolutely no privacy.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>They locked uI think one of the shames of the American Library Associatiois the
                    Cubans locked up librarians. I mean real librarians. These weren't spies who
                    were posing as librarians. These were women who were running a little library in
                    their homes of a couple hundred books, many of them donated by the U.S.
                    government, children's books, this sort of stuff. And the Cubans would lock them
                    up for anti-state activities or some such title. And the ALA never registereas
                    the National Press Club always does whenever journalists are abusenever
                    registered a prominent complaint against them.</p>
                <p>But the intrusion of the government into the private life of Cubanthey have no
                    private lifand the complete dictatorial powers and the horrible way in which
                    they are imposed, made a lasting impression on me. While I was in Havana, we had
                    dinner at the PAO's residence with the spouses of about fifteen of the
                    dissidents. I remember one of them saying to me at the end of the evening,
                    “Whatever you do, please do not lift the embargo, because it will accomplish
                    nothing for us and will only extend the longevity of Fidel Castro.” So everyone,
                    of course, just plays a waiting game. Unfortunately he's apparently in
                    remarkably robust health, but everybody is just waiting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well when you were in Canada, as I recall, when Chr�tien
                        went to Cuba this was a big deal, being a prime minister and all. And he
                        asked for certain things, including letting people go. And Castro just did
                        nothing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Exactly right. Not a thing. Not a thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So did this register with the Canadians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: I think it may have. Yes. I mean, I think it didn't help John
                    Chr�tien's legacy. He was on his last run anyways and it was quite clear that he
                    wasn't going to be running again for Prime Minister, I believe, at that stage. I
                    don't think it was enough to make voters switch parties, or switch allegiances,
                    but it definitely did register. And several columnists wrote about the fact that
                    he'd gone down there to confront Mr. Castro in his own den and made these
                    demands, none of which were granted, which is an embarrassment for a Prime
                    Minister of a country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you got back, USIA had been amalgamated into
                        the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: It was amalgamated in '99. And I came back about two and a half years
                    later. And of course the amalgamation is still going on. Consolidation is the
                    approved word.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find this? The new game?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Still settling down, still very much settling down. It was terribly
                    important that we get elements of USIA, if not all of it, over here into the
                    main State Department building. I think for Public Diplomacy to play a central
                    role it has got to be not just integrated on the organization chart, but the
                    people have to be over here so they are mixing with each other. In WHA/PDA, I
                    found, obviously, more interaction with all the people in the geographic offices
                    that I needed to deal with, the people in the Andean regional office and the
                    Brazil and Southern Cone and the Caribbean office, than I ever would have had I
                    been over in the old USIA building. I found that was terribly important. And the
                    more enlightened Office Director welcomed you in and welcomed my Desk Officers
                    to their weekly staff meetings. So USIA elements weren't really integrated into
                    Departmental operations. And I personalland this is just my vieI think that the
                    people in IIP and ECA, the two bureaus over there in the old USIA building, need
                    to get over here somewhere, if not in the main building, preferably, then at
                    least in something like the building across the street so there's much more
                    interaction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well I must say that I've done a lot of interviewing of
                        USIA retirees. And really when you get to a Washington assignment for
                        someone, frankly, it's kind of boring because it's pretty much nuts and
                        bolts and personnel and there is hardly any tie-in to policy. And then when
                        you are overseas, I mean, they're probably the point of the spear.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: I think that's exactly right. I've always felt that overseas our jobs
                    in Public Diplomacy were so much more interesting than any other job in the
                    embassy. But you get back to Washington, the whole flow, the whole balance scale
                    is just so different. The regional offices in Washington, the political offices,
                    really do tell the field what to do. They come up with the marching orders,
                    whether from the Undersecretary, whether from P or whether from the Office
                    Director in the Caribbean region. Cables go out, or e-mails now more, to the
                    embassy saying “Here are your marching orders. You do this and this.”</p>
                <p>Whereas it's the opposite for us. In Public Diplomacy we react to the field. It's
                    the field that takes the lead and decides, due to their local circumstances, the
                    best way to implement American foreign policy through Public Diplomacy. And then
                    we support them. So they come to us, not with demands, but with requests for us
                    to support. I think jobs in Washington in the political cone, for instance, or
                    archetypal political jobs in Washington, are more rewarding because they are
                    really involved in making policy, and then you send it to the field to be
                    implemented. Whereas it's kind of the reverse flow in Public Diplomacy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, you did this for two years. And then what?
                        Retired?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>SHINKMAN: I retired. There must be a better word. As soon as I knew I was going
                    to retire, as soon as my wife and I had made that decision, I banished the word
                    “retire” from my lexicoI think when you hear that word you think about going out
                    and playing golf, moving to Ft. Lauderdale, that sort of stuff. And I was 61
                    years old, just turned 61, and obviously planned to work for many more years,
                    not least because Riggs Bank wants me to work until I pay off our mortgage or
                    whatever. So I knew I was going to be doing other things.</p>
                <p>The State Department runs an excellent program called the Job Search Program
                    where they give you two monthit used to give three months, but two months is
                    still generouwhere they give you a month of intensive training in how to do
                    interviews, what to wear, how to search for jobs, how to network, all that sort
                    of stuff, and a second month where you go out and apply it. I finished working
                    in WHA at the end of July last year, 2004, with the intention that I would go
                    through the Job Search Program, fully intending to find a job that I would start
                    on the Monday after I officially retired, working 8-5 in some office somewhere
                    else.</p>
                <p>But over the course of those two months, I decided that that wasn't what I wanted
                    to do. I wanted to A) make sure I only did things that I really wanted to do, (
                    At this stage in my life I don't need to do things I don't want to do.) and B)
                    maybe I could pull some pieces together and come up with some bits and pieces,
                    and put them together and have a fun life with a little more flexible schedule.
                    So I did that. This isn't really State Department oral history, but I have had
                    an affection for motorcycles for the last almost 40 years. 38 years. And an
                    affection for a particular brand of motorcycle called Harley Davidson, an
                    American manufacturer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The hog?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Well, many of them are called hogs, yes. For the last 28 years, since
                    1977, when I got my first Harley. I've had Harleys with me at my posts all over
                    the world. And over the years I've gotten to know several senior executives in
                    the corporation - they are in Milwaukebut, particularly well, the Vice President
                    for Government Affairs. So I wrote him a letter last summer when I was in the
                    Job Search Program and said “You know, I'm looking for something to do. You
                    don't have an office in Washington. What do you think?” I got a nice letter back
                    from him saying “Gee, what an interesting idea. But actually we have a small
                    government operations office. It's a handful of us” three or four of the“and we
                    are doing pretty well as we are. So I don't think we have anything to offer
                    you.” So I said “Okay, fine.”</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>I've never been to Milwaukee, but Harley Davidson celebrated its hundredth
                    anniversary two years ago in 2003. It is sort of a Mecca for Harley riders, so I
                    said to my friend “I think my wife and I are just going to come out anyways to
                    see Milwaukee. I'd like to see it. And while I'm there, can I meet with you?”
                    So, nice guy, he said “Sure, come on out.” And he ended up making a day's worth
                    of appointments for me with the people in the Office of Government Affairs and
                    the Office of Communications, both fields that I'd fit comfortably into. And I
                    had dinner with two of their Vice Presidents and my wife.</p>
                <p>We came back to Washington, and I went back into the job search, continued the
                    Job Search Program. Looked at some other options. And then about that same time,
                    I ran into a very good friend, a Foreign Service Officer called Joe Johnson, a
                    Public Diplomacy officer. He was the head of an office called e-Diplomacy, which
                    is in IRM, the Bureau of Information Resource Management. e-Diplomacy's jothis
                    small office where we are sitting right now, of about 15 to 18 peoplis to try
                    and integrate policy and technology in a way that policy drives the development
                    of technology and not the other way around. It's not the IT people who come to
                    you and say “We have this marvelous new program. Now you can use it to go out
                    and do your job.” We go to them and say “We need to accomplish this. What can
                    you develop that we can use to accomplish this?” It's an interesting job. I've
                    never worked in technology before in my life.</p>
                <p>In this Office of e-Diplomacy they have a billet for each of the cones. They have
                    a billet for a Public Diplomacy Officer, an Econ officer, a Consular officer, an
                    OMS, a Political officer. And the Public Diplomacy officer job was open. There
                    were no bidders on it. Joe said to mhe and I had chatted on a number of
                    occasion“You know, I'd be happy to have you come and fill this job. If you don't
                    want to work full time” which is what I had told hi“I think it can be done on a
                    less than full time basis.” It was always with the understanding that if a
                    Foreign Service Officer without a job, if HR calls up and says “We've got this
                    unassigned FSO. We need a spot for him.” Zing, he's going in there. I could be
                    out by the end of the week.</p>
                <p>So I said “Sure, I'll give it a try.” And, starting last November, I started
                    working in e-Diplomacy about five hours a day, about 25 hours a week, which is
                    great fun. I'm learning all kinds of stuff that I never knew before. And I think
                    at this stage in my life, it's not a bad thing to be learning challenging new
                    things. At about the same time I got a phone call from my friend at Harley
                    Davidson saying “When you were up here, everyone was very impressed with you” it
                    was a very nice thing of him to sa“and I wonder if maybe there aren't some ways
                    that we can collaborate.” So that was an exciting phone call to receive.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>Over the course of the next month or two we worked up an agreement where I now
                    represent Harley Davidson, particularly in developing their sales in east Asia,
                    where there is a large demand for motorcycles. There are economies out there
                    that are growing very fast, so people can afford to buy motorcycles. But at the
                    same time there are outrageously unfair tariff and duty regimens. A lot of those
                    problems are being dealt with through bi-national trade associations, business
                    councils. Harley is a member of these various business councils, all of them
                    based in Washington, but rarely can the company afford to have somebody come
                    down for a one or two hour meeting and then go back to Milwaukee. So now I
                    regularly attend on their behalf.</p>
                <p>I am working for Harley Davidson for four or five hours a week. The most recent
                    example being this morning. I went to a briefing by the ambassador of Thailand
                    about Tsunami relief. And we are trying very harthey have non-tariff barriers
                    preventing us from selling our motorcycles in Thailand. So, I attended as I
                    wanted to meet the people at the embassy. And, we are also making a large
                    contribution to Tsunami relief.</p>
                <p>Those two things are kind of fitting together. I have much less job security now.
                    I mean, I have worked for the Foreign Service for twenty-six and a half years
                    where you knew that that paycheck was going to be coming in even if you didn't
                    have a desk to go to. You had absolute job security. Now, I have virtually none.
                    Harley Davidson could pull the plug, although we agreed to do it for a year and
                    see how it works out. And the Office of e-Diplomacy could do the same thing
                    tomorrow. However, they seem to be well pleased with what I'm doing in
                    e-Diplomacy, so I don't think that's likely to happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You opened up two lines of inquiry. One about the Harley
                        Davidson. I would think that what you would be up against the Isuzu or
                        whatever it is, the Japanese motorcycle makers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: There are four major Japanese manufacturers. They are very, very
                    powerful. Honda, Suzuki, Kawasaki and Yamaha. And they are very big companies,
                    very powerful companies. Two of them also make cars. But Harley Davidson is an
                    American icon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A tremendous name.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Tremendous name. In terms of brand recognition, it's right up there
                    with Coca Cola and Boeing and IBM and those sorts of names. And the fact that we
                    only manufacture motorcycles in the United States makes it really an American
                    icon. And an awful lot of people like that. Harley also makes great motorcycles.
                    They have done an absolute turnaround in the last 25 years and gone from making
                    not such solid, reliable motorcycles to ones now that are completely reliable.
                    They are just great, great machines. Harley just came out with a new model two
                    years ago that's incredibly fast with a liquid cooled engine that's really
                    nifty. It's a great company, which make great products, which are in high
                    demand.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>And what's funnnot in an amusing sensis that some of our target countries have
                    tax structures that keep us out but don't really accomplish anything because the
                    country doesn't make large motorcycles. Harley only makes large displacement
                    motorcycles and the duties are so high that they stop people from buying them.
                    So no tax revenue is generated. They are not revenue enhancing measures. All
                    they do is keep us out without protecting any domestic industry. So we are
                    struggling with that. And I think we're making some progress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On e-Diplomacy, what the hell is this? What do you mean?
                        What do you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: Well, I work on various things. Any Public Diplomacy officer will know
                    the letters DRS, the Distribution Record System where they keep track of
                    contacts. Every embassy has some sort of a contact record system. They are
                    usually fragmented. The Political Section will have one, probably. And then all
                    the systems will be consolidated for the Embassy's Fourth of July party. And
                    then once that's gone, the impetus to coordinate it all goes away. These systems
                    run from very sophisticated electronic systems literally to posts where the
                    senior FSN has a shoebox in the bottom drawer of her desk with 3 by 5 cards in
                    it saying who the current Minister of Culture is. There is a feeling in this day
                    and age that we need to marshal our information better. There also, of course,
                    is a mandate from the Congress that we need to keep better track of the people
                    we spend money on, particularly student exchanges, post 9/11, of course,
                    International Visitors that we bring into the country, as well as students we
                    bring here. We need to keep track of who these people are, partially for
                    security reasons but also to document how we've spent our money, and then to
                    follow up with them.</p>
                <p>You know, the International Visitor Prograthat I'm sure you sent people on when
                    you were on active duty and I sent people on when I was on active dutit's
                    probably the most life changing thing you can give to a contact who you respect
                    abroad. It costs a lot of money. To send someone here for a month costs well
                    over ten thousand dollars. It cost ten thousand dollars the last time I checked,
                    which was probably four or five years ago. So it's a major investment of money
                    by the U.S. government. And we find that we don't keep track of them very well.
                    And IVas they are callewill quite often over time just lose contact with the
                    embassy. Well, that's crazy. After we've invested this money in a person, we
                    should maintain contact. So there are directives from Congress to do a better
                    job of tracking that.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>This all comes under what I now know as the generic title of “contact
                    management.” And so in e-Diplomacy we are looking asince I'm a Public Diplomacy
                    officer and Public Affairs abroad has taken the lead on this generallat
                    developing some sort of a systeperhaps with Microsoft, perhaps with some other
                    companthat could be used not just to consolidate information at post so that the
                    Political section knows who Public Affairs is in touch with and vice versa, but
                    also so the area office in Washington knows who the embassy has been in touch
                    with, and that other U.S. embassies in the region may know who people have been
                    in touch with. This is a major exercise, to go from the shoebox in the desk
                    drawer to a enterprise-widwhich is a phrase I now know means across the whole
                    State Departmensystem. I think it will be years before we get to it. But that's
                    the sort of thing we are looking at.</p>
                <p>Looking at what's called “content management.” You look at a web site. Virtually
                    every U.S. embassy in the world has a public web site and a private internal
                    intranet site. And there is very little coherence among them in terms of how the
                    sites look and how you maneuver in them, how you navigate. There's a feeling
                    that really, in this day and age, major corporations are much better than the
                    U.S. Government is at sharing the knowledge they have, the information they
                    have, in the company. We need to do a better job of that. You hear all sorts of
                    things like “communities of practice,” the COP. Again, these are all interesting
                    expressions that I have learned. I hadn't the foggiest idea what they meant
                    before I moved to e-Diplomacy. And my knowledge is still somewhat foggy, but
                    it's somewhat . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you know the acronyms, so you can throw those
                        out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: I can throw them out with the best of them. Like any good FSO, I'm
                    great with initials. We do that sort of stuff and it is interesting work. It
                    really is. And I'm dealing with people whnot so much in this office although to
                    some degree in this officwho are completely technical oriented ... you know, the
                    IMOs abroad, the Information Management Officers at posts, and trying to keep a
                    level-headed FSO generalist perspective on things. It is fun, it's interesting
                    work. It really is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Well, I guess it's a good place to stop.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: I think so. I've enjoyed this enormously.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to thank you, but I want to say one thing. As a
                        professional consular officer for thirty years, watch it on those damn
                        motorcycles because I havincluding FSOI have arranged for the shipment back
                        of the remains of motorcycle . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SHINKMAN: On this cheerful note, Stu. No. I am aware of that and I am
                    careful.</p>
