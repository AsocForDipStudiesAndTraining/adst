                <p>This paper is dedicated to the late Jim Howard who encouraged me to include in
                    this oral interview some information on the early days of the Foreign
                    Agriculture Service and its predecessors.</p>
                <p>Richard S. Welton, October 1996</p>
                <p>This is Quentin Bates, a retiree from the Foreign Agricultural Service, (FAS)
                    interviewing Richard Welton. He spent almost his entire career with that
                    service. We are going to discuss first some of the highlights of Dick's career,
                    and then get into the history of that agency. Dick has had for some time a
                    strong interest in that history, and has done considerable research on it. Today
                    is January 6, 1996.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's begin with a bit of your background, where you grew
                        up, your education, and so forth.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I grew up on a general livestock farm near Moorefield, West Virginia, on
                    the south branch of the Potomac River. I did my undergraduate work at the
                    University of Maryland, graduating in agricultural economics in 1956. I think I
                    graduated on Saturday and started to work for the new FAS on the next Monday. I
                    worked with the Livestock and Meat Products Division as a commodity analyst in
                    Washington for about five years, and then went to Argentina as Assistant Attach�
                    in 1961.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which I remember very well.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>WELTON: You were there at the same time. We worked there for about five years
                    together. Then I came back to the trade policy part of the agency in early 1969,
                    when you were there as well. I spent about four years in Washington, and then
                    went overseas again to Spain in 1973, as Assistant Attach�. Excuse me, I missed
                    a post: I went to El Salvador as Agricultural Attach� in 1966, and then came
                    back to the trade policy area in early 1969 and then went to Spain as Assistant
                    in 1973, and moved to Mexico City two years later as Agricultural Attach�. I was
                    there about three years, and came back to the Agency in the Attach� Service in
                    Washington. I spent a little time with the Foreign Visitors Staff, and then
                    became Area Officer for Western Europe, and then Deputy Assistant Administrator
                    for the attach�s. I served for some time as Acting Assistant Administrator
                    between the time that Wayne Sharp accepted another assignment, and Jim Rudbeck
                    came back from Rome. I retired in 1989 after 33 years with FAS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dick, you certainly had an extremely interesting and
                        varied experience in your career. When and how did you begin to develop an
                        interest in the history of the organization?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: When I was in the Attach� Office here in Washington, I ran across a file
                    that had a lot of the background and history of FAS, and particularly the
                    attach� service. We had a junior professional development program, which I
                    worked closely with, and one of them took an interest in that subject, and
                    drawing on some FAS circulars that had been published in the 1960s and 1970s,
                    put together a chronology of FAS, even going before that, back to the early
                    years of the country. The interest in foreign agriculture — Columbus, for
                    example, introduced cattle and horses, and I think even swine to the colonies.
                    That was the basis for the livestock industry. And a lot of our crops, of
                    course, were introduced from Europe, and the reverse was also true. I think
                    potatoes had been developed in the New World, and tomatoes and corn. Maize was
                    of U.S. origin; the Indians taught the settlers how to plant corn, I recall. So
                    that chronology was the basis for further discussion of the history of FAS. A
                    number of our colleagues have had an interest in pulling some of that history
                    together. Jim Howard was instrumental in compiling and publishing a history of
                    the Foreign Market Development Program, Market Promotion Overseas, which is
                    quite thorough and quite complete. He had asked some of our other colleagues,
                    like Horace Davis, to put down their ideas on the history. They have done some
                    of that, but it's never gotten into one publication, and we certainly don't
                    intend to cover the complete history here, but I thought we would try to append
                    to this interview the chronology and a few other items of information on the
                    origins of the service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I sat in on the meeting in which a group of us agreed we
                        would take this project on, and we perhaps foolishly volunteered to take it
                        on. Ray Ioanes was one of those who was very instrumental in pushing this,
                        along with Jim Howard and several others in the group.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>WELTON: As I mentioned the older FAS started in 1930. That first FAS was a
                    division of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, (BAE) which was a very
                    important organization in the inter war period, between World War I and World
                    War II, of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it was fairly unique in the world at that time. It
                        had tremendous prestige, and as I understand it, a great many of the top USA
                        agricultural economists during that period were in the Bureau of
                        Agricultural Economics.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: That is true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a division of the BAE?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: FAS was a division of BAE. Actually, before that, there had been a Bureau
                    of Statistics and it had sent a fellow named Edwin Moffitt to London in
                    1881.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In BAE?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: No, before BAE. BAE was established in 1922. This was before that, even
                    before 1900. This fellow had been sent to London in 1881, to report on crop
                    prospects and other agricultural developments. It appears that there was an
                    officer, or someone in the embassy in London, reporting on agriculture, almost
                    from that date on. A 1960 publication mentions a section of foreign markets,
                    established in 1894, which was in the old Bureau of Statistics, which had
                    monthly reports on agricultural developments coming in from London during that
                    period. And then later, after World War I, the prototype for the Agricultural
                    Attach� , as we know it, was sent to London in 1919. His name was Edward Foley
                    and his title was Commissioner of Agriculture at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What agency was he responsible to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I think he was responsive to USDA. At that time there was a Foreign
                    Markets Investigations Division in the Bureau of Markets. Later the foreign
                    agricultural section was part of the Statistical and Historical Research Bureau
                    before BAE was organized. In 1939, that FAS became the Office of Foreign
                    Agricultural Relations, (OFAR), as we know it. It was actually a staff section
                    of the Secretary's office. It was separated from the BAE in 1938. It then became
                    a staff office of the Secretary's office and the attach�s at that time, in the
                    1930s, certainly were reporting to the Secretary of Agriculture, to the old FAS,
                    prior to that. But in 1939 the 9 Attach�s were transferred to the Department of
                    State.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back for a minute. You had mentioned at the
                        beginning some of the early activities of the Department of Agriculture, or
                        other agencies, very early on. Can you expand a little bit on that, of going
                        way back ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I say sometimes that we shifted from being seed collectors — that was a
                    primary role of the early emissaries abroad, to data collectors in the 1930s.
                    Even as early as the Civil War or thereabouts, Mark Twain wrote in Innocent's
                    Abroad, about the seed collectors. I believe it was written in 1869. He said “I
                    was proud to observe [on his ship] that among the excursionists were 3 ministers
                    of the gospel, 8 doctors,... naval chieftains with sounding titles, an ample
                    crop of professors...and a gentleman who had Commissioner of the United States
                    of America, to Europe, Asia, and Africa, thundering after his name!” And he said
                    he almost shrunk in his seat from the awful blast of that title. But then he
                    said that if he'd only known then that “he was only a common mortal, and that
                    his mission had nothing more overpowering about it than the collecting of seeds,
                    and uncommon yams, cabbages, and peculiar bullfrogs,... I would have felt so
                    much relieved.” This activity went on for a number of years and still goes on,
                    but I think now generally these researchers go out from the Agricultural
                    Research Service. They have contacts, of course, abroad, and I'm sure they use
                    our Attach� offices at times, but I don't believe we're much involved in that
                    activity on a continuing basis anymore.</p>
                <p>I might mention one seed collector that was kind of intriguing. A fellow named
                    Frank Meyer, was sent to China in 1905, and there's a picture of him in a horse
                    cart in the 1962 USDA yearbook. I saw this picture first at the Attach� office
                    in Beijing, so I was kind of curious about him, and explored it a bit further.
                    He traveled as far as Turkestan, at least, and if you look on the map, that's a
                    long way to go with a horse cart. He was in China until he disappeared
                    mysteriously on the Yangtze River in 1918. I don't know if he was shanghaied,
                    but his body did turn up later. In fact, he left a bequest to the seed
                    collection branch, and they fashioned a medal in his honor, and that's still
                    awarded each year, I believe, to the outstanding seed collector of the year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is still an ongoing activity?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I think so, yes. There are several regional laboratories that handle
                    these collections of plants and seeds. You have to be very careful, of course,
                    because of the disease or pest risk. I might mention in this regard that, as you
                    know, back in our early days in Argentina, we received a letter from a
                    researcher in Pennsylvania, that had gotten some wild seed potatoes from
                    Argentina. This was in the early 1960s that we received the letter. He had
                    written it to Paul Nyhus, the Attach� there in the late 1930s, just like it was
                    last week, or last year. Fortunately, our foreign national employee, Eduardo
                    knew that there was one potato specialist still around that was around at that
                    time, and might have ...</p>

                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was retired wasn't he, but still alive.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: That's right. The potato expert remembered the incident, and where the
                    potatoes came from. So we replied and gave him the information, just like it was
                    routine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Never heard from the guy about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: We didn't, but maybe some successors did. I mention, too, that I was
                    reading Jim Kempton's guidelines on the Attach� Service, entitled The Official
                    Life and Hard Times of an Agricultural Attach� which has some very good advice,
                    even for today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Jim Kempton was our Attach� for about 15 years in
                        Venezuela. That's the longest tour anybody ever had.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I believe so. I was fortunate enough to go to his retirement party in
                    1957. He told some interesting stories there about his experiences in USDA,
                    which went way back, I think, to before World War I, when he first came in. One
                    story he told was that when he was a young new employee, and having lunch, the
                    Secretary would come down for lunch, and he would notice all of his bureau
                    chiefs sitting around, and would know that if he sat with them, they would be
                    bending his ear with personnel complaints or whatever, concerns of the day. So
                    he would pick out one of the youngest employees and have lunch with him. Kempton
                    said he never got that close to the Secretary of Agriculture again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Jim was a fantastic storyteller.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Yes. As you know, one of the Assistant Secretaries of State for Latin
                    America had standing instructions that he was to see any agriculture report from
                    Jim Kempton. They went pretty far afield at times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very earthy at times, but always funny and
                        interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: He was an excellent writer.</p>

                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>WELTON: One of the things I noticed in his attach� guidance document was that you
                    should establish contact with museums and the scientific community, because you
                    might get some requests for rare seeds. And in my years overseas, I think the
                    only contact we had like that was on the seed potato case, and that was a bit
                    dated. But most of the guidance was very good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dick, you mentioned about the collection of seeds,
                        livestock, and that sort of thing back in those early days. At what point
                        was there an official interest in trade problems? That, of course, is one of
                        our major activities now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: And of course the agricultural trade surplus is an important contributor
                    to holding down the balance of payments deficits that we know today. But that
                    started very early on. I mentioned the Spanish bringing livestock to the country
                    and taking tobacco back. But obviously the real interest in trade didn't develop
                    until the U.S. became settled in the 1600s by the English. They developed a
                    quite active trade in tobacco and tobacco was certainly king among our export
                    products in the early years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did cotton start becoming important?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Not until the early 1800s. Tobacco was the leading export until the early
                    1800s and then cotton took over as king, certainly through the mid-1800s.
                    Agricultural products accounted for over 70% of USA total exports prior to 1900
                    and cotton was over 50% of the total from 1840 to 1860. Later, grains came on as
                    a leading export commodity, partially as a result of the Irish potato famine in
                    the 1840s. I think grains did replace cotton as the leading export in the 1860s.
                    Of course, as you know, during the Civil War, the South was trying to ship
                    cotton to England to finance the war effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With blockade runners.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Yes, they had blockade runners. But grain started coming in about that
                    time as well. I don't know if we had any relief programs during the 1800s to
                    Europe, but if there were, it may have been involved in feeding the Irish. But I
                    don't think the Irish had that big a lobby in Congress at that time. I'm not
                    sure about that point. We may have to leave that to other historians. Certainly
                    grain exports got a big boost from the opening of the Great Plains and the
                    development of mechanical harvesters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At what point did the government start getting interested
                        in the statistics of trade?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>WELTON: The Department — I think I mentioned the fellow that they sent to England
                    in the 1880s. Even before the Department was formed, during the Civil War in
                    1862. Before that, agriculture was covered by the Patent Office. I remember a
                    story: Art Minor, one of our leaders in the modern FAS, was briefing a group
                    from Japan at one time, and he mentioned that the Department of Agriculture
                    started off as the Patent Office. This got the Japanese all excited. They got so
                    interested in that facet I think he hardly got them back to the history of
                    Agriculture. Anyhow, I think the Patent Office started collecting statistics as
                    early as 1839, when Congress appropriated some money for that purpose. In 1842,
                    the chronology on agricultural reporting mentions that a Patent Office report
                    discussed foreign markets and duties for such commodities as cotton and fats and
                    oils. Then the system of reporting was basically established in the latter part
                    of the 1800s. And besides the fellow in London, they were getting some
                    information from other diplomatic posts abroad during that period. By 1894,
                    there was a foreign markets section in the Bureau of Statistics in USDA, and
                    they were publishing some reports — I remember reading one from a missionary in
                    Argentina on sheep raising in the Pampas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there any record of any trade negotiations in those
                        days, or any diplomatic protests on some of these duties and taxes that
                        you've mentioned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I doubt if we had formal negotiations on a wide scale. I think that's
                    largely a post-World War II phenomenon. But there certainly were discussions
                    with some of our neighboring countries and other major trading partners and some
                    trade issues could well have taken place. I have read of some discussions about
                    the British Imperial preference. And of course prior to the Revolution, the
                    colonies had a colonial preference in London. And the colonies were prohibited
                    from shipping rice and tobacco to other countries prior to 1730.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we also made a protest in Boston Harbor, with a tea
                        party.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Yes, there was that one. And I think I read also that there was quite a
                    trade with tobacco going — well, not tobacco so much — but food commodities
                    going to the West Indies. Sugar, of course, was their export crop, and they
                    didn't devote much time or energy to food crops. So they needed to import grains
                    which came mostly from New York and Pennsylvania. In fact, I think we exported
                    quite a bit of flour to that area in exchange for sugar, I presume. In fact, I
                    saw bread mentioned as well. It must have been pretty stale. In fact there were
                    problems with quality and the Pennsylvania assembly adopted rigid inspection
                    laws in 1720. And there was small trade in meat products as well during those
                    early years. I read somewhere that meat was a leading export from Pennsylvania
                    in the early colonial days, which surprised me a bit. It must have been beef
                    jerky. We know that a little later Argentina became a major beef supplier to
                    London and Europe.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess they iced it down.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Refrigeration came later, probably in the late 1870s. About the same
                    time, the opening of the West coincided with a substantial growth in USA
                    agricultural exports which were still over 70% of total USA exports until 1900.
                    Prior to 1870 the value of USA agricultural exports was less than $200 million
                    annually. That total more than doubled in the 1870s and reached $700 million by
                    the 1890s. The World War I boom and the food relief efforts that followed pushed
                    that figure to $4 billion in 1919. But it fell sharply in the 1920s and in fact
                    was already down to $2 billion by 1921. It declined further during the
                    Depression in the 1930s and by the end of the 1930s we were down to about $500
                    million a year. And then of course, during World War II — we'll get into that a
                    little more later — exports rose again. We were the only supplier to some parts
                    of the world. Our shipments to most of Europe and Japan were eliminated during
                    that period. But by the time I came into the Agency in 1956, we were probably
                    back to a level of $4 billion or thereabouts. And then there was a fairly steady
                    rise in exports after that period. I remember when, and Ioanes mentions this in
                    his interview as well, that President Nixon came out with a goal of $10 billion
                    for agricultural exports in the late 1960s, and some of us thought that was a
                    pipedream. But it wasn't too long after that, in the early 1970s, that Russia
                    came in for large amounts of grain, and we did reach that goal and surpassed it
                    rather substantially in the 1970s. By 1981 we had reached a peak of about $43
                    billion. But then exports dropped rather substantially. Dick Smith mentions in
                    his interview that they declined every year that he was Administrator. Not
                    through any fault of his, in my opinion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can remember when it was just beginning to rise pretty
                        rapidly. It was about 1969 or 1970, when we celebrated the first $1 billion
                        exports towards any one country, which was Japan. We had a big celebration
                        and I helped organize that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I hear that Japan is up to about $11 billion today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are shipping about $1 billion worth of meat, aren't
                        we?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Oh yes. You and I worked on the famous beef and citrus negotiations with
                    Japan in the early 1970s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a career in itself — negotiating with Japan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: They said their stomachs were not big enough to absorb all this beef. But
                    they learned differently. And beef exports has become a major success story.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Japanese stomachs have expanded substantially.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Perhaps so. But anyhow, in total we got up to a record $43.8 billion in
                    FY 1981 and agricultural shipments didn't get back to $42 billion until 1992.
                    And then we had a very good year in fiscal 95. I hear they are now projecting
                    $58 billion for the current fiscal year. It's been a very successful result of a
                    lot of efforts by a lot of people over a lot of years, in fact, to reach that
                    level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Agricultural reporting, for quite a number of years now,
                        has been one of the core activities of the Foreign Agricultural Service, and
                        of the Agricultural Attach�s specifically. What about the early days of that
                        activity?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: It certainly has been, and I've mentioned some of the early pioneers in
                    that effort. We also should point out in the early years travelers abroad
                    brought back information and the embassies were involved in supplying
                    statistical data. One of the things I recall from my early days in FAS, and you
                    will too, is that in the commodity divisions, they received the annual trade
                    books from a number of countries all over the world. Those were sent in from the
                    embassy under, I think we called them CERP publications. I believe CERP stands
                    for Current Economic Reporting Program. We had in each of the commodity
                    divisions some statistical clerks who would laboriously take off that data each
                    year and put it on the large world trade tables, and the information which was
                    compiled from those reports, got published and sent out to the various interests
                    in the states and around the world. Also, in the early 1900s, a Californian
                    became interested in getting more worldwide data. He had seen the reports from
                    USDA on U.S.A. agricultural statistics in great detail, and thought that we
                    should have similar information from abroad. He was instrumental in finally
                    selling the King of Italy on establishing a worldwide organization, which became
                    the International Institute for Agriculture, the predecessor for the Food and
                    Agriculture Organization (FAO), which is also headquartered in Rome, and which
                    has been compiling statistics on worldwide agriculture since that time. One of
                    the early yearbooks mentions that prior to 1930 very few countries had done an
                    agricultural census. But with the help and support of the International
                    Institute, some 60 countries took a census of agriculture during 1930. So that
                    was an important step in compiling and disseminating this most basic
                    information.</p>
                <p>I might also mention that in USDA, began a series of monthly reports on
                    agricultural developments around the world in 1919 called foreign crops and
                    markets. When I came in in 1956, we were still submitting items for a weekly
                    report of that same title. It was combined with the Foreign Agriculture Magazine
                    in 1963. And that became a monthly information bulletin on foreign agricultural
                    developments, which has the name Ag Exporter today, but is still a monthly
                    publication. I believe that pretty much covers the early reporting and
                    statistical information. We may get more into that in a later period as we go
                    on.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think the quality of that reporting was very good almost
                        from the beginning, and pretty much accepted around the world as the best
                        statistics available.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: That's correct. We've had reports of foreign governments that pretty much
                    accepted the local Ag Attach�'s views.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've had experience on that. Once in a while I'd pick up
                        the official government report, and it would sound familiar, and then I'd go
                        back to a report that I had written which I had furnished to the Ministry of
                        Agriculture, and found that it was almost word for word my report.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I think some people wondered, with the International Institute, and later
                    FAO, why FAS and its predecessors felt it necessary to have their own people
                    abroad. The big reason was that FAO and its predecessor had to rely entirely on
                    what the host country government supplied it in terms of statistics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They felt that they couldn't publish figures that were at
                        variance with what the official figures were. There were many countries,
                        where the official data were not just guesses, but deliberately
                        distorted.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I think we had a very good experience in Argentina, where we had good
                    sources of information outside of the government. I never felt that anybody
                    deliberately tried to mislead us there, but when I got into Central America and
                    the coffee republics — this was the time of the International Coffee Agreement,
                    which had established quotas for each country — and their interest was to
                    convince us that they had a tremendous surplus of coffee, so that they could get
                    a larger quota. There I did feel that they misled us. In fact, the Ambassador,
                    before I went there, told my predecessor, that was Dick Smith, who later became
                    the Administrator that he had been called in to a Cabinet meeting, where they
                    had been discussing the coffee situation. And that the President said, “Now,
                    just how can we convince you that we've got all this coffee?” And the Ambassador
                    replied, “ Well, it might help if you stopped lying to the Agricultural
                    Attach�.” Diplomacy and tact weren't two of his stronger elements. Anyhow, that
                    was the situation we had in coffee.</p>
                <p>I remember also a personal experience when the Chairman, or whatever he was, of
                    the Coffee Company, which was a state trading agency, who invited me to
                    accompany him around to see the coffee plantations just before harvest. I was
                    staring at red coffee beans through the car window all day long, and got the
                    worst headache I've ever had. But he was trying to convince me that they had a
                    tremendous crop. But I'm sure there were a lot of similar experiences at other
                    posts as well.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>One thing I should mention, perhaps, on reporting: In later years when the agency
                    became more focused on market development, there's been a lot of concern that
                    perhaps the Attach�s were spending too much time on mundane reports on different
                    crops, rather than focusing on encouraging more export sales.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And were getting requests for information from a lot of
                        different sources.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: That's right. In fact, the commodity divisions might write or call and
                    request specific information. So to control that a bit, a reports office was
                    established in the 1950s in the modern FAS to review reporting schedules and
                    make revisions. And in fact, over the years, FAS has dropped some of the
                    commodities we used to report on. I started out as a wool and mohair expert in
                    livestock, and I believe there were 19 commodities that were dropped completely
                    during Dick Smith's tenure as Administrator. Wool and mohair were two of those.
                    And there were other similar commodities which we no longer report on, on a
                    regular basis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might note that I was directly involved in the
                        establishment of that reports office. When I came back from Colombia in late
                        1955, Ioanes gave me the responsibility for reorganizing and redrafting the
                        reporting schedule, and setting up this office to control the flow of
                        reports. I'm not sure that that wasn't the first formal...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I think that probably was the first formal office that handled that. I
                    don't believe there was a separate office with that function prior to that. Of
                    course the agency prior to the time I came in was fairly small.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was in 1956.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I just want to mention two other areas on reporting that I might
                    elaborate a bit on. Jim Howard mentioned that one of the things that might be of
                    interest is how some of the early Attach�s collected information. For example,
                    he mentioned that Owen Dawson, our man in China before World War II, would take
                    a train trip through the same growing area each growing season. And he would
                    count the telephone poles opposite each field, to get an idea of how much wheat
                    for example they were growing that year in comparison with the year before. And
                    I remember Brice Meeker, who was in Russia, had a mechanized gizmo, that would
                    attach right to the odometer on a car, and you could do the same thing. And he'd
                    have different crops, and he would punch a button whenever he came to a field
                    with that particular crop, to indicate how many miles of that crop they had in
                    that particular area. It was a good example of what we later called ground
                    truth, which they need to base the estimates that we can now calculate using
                    information from satellite data, which are overflying some of these major
                    producing countries.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>The other thing he mentioned was that Paul Minneman, who was in Cuba in the mid
                    1940s, and was asked to report on the size of the sugar crop, which of course
                    was the major crop in Cuba. He would visit the mills, and tell them that if they
                    gave him information on their production, that he would share the data of the
                    whole country with them, which they found of course quite useful and
                    interesting. That helped get information.</p>
                <p>I might mention one of my favorite stories about statistics involving a fellow we
                    both knew in Argentina, John Crume. He was in Iran, I believe, and got one of
                    these requests that went out from the Department from time to time in those
                    days, kind of an overall view of the tallow and soap industry, and the
                    production and consumption statistics. And John found out that there was one man
                    that really controlled the industry. In Iran, as in many developing countries,
                    one fellow would control the whole industry. In fact, in Spain one of the things
                    that Franco did was kind of parcel out those industries to his friends and they
                    of course prospered over the years from control of those industries. But anyhow,
                    the one in Iran — John was reading this detailed survey request to his source
                    and he was just providing the answers very readily to the questions. But John
                    got to thinking that the figures just didn't sound reasonable. He said to the
                    General, “The figure you gave me for soap consumption would work out to about 4
                    bars per year per capita.” And the general looked him straight in the eye and
                    said, “Would you like me to double it?” So he realized that he might not have
                    had the irrefutable source that he thought, which of course many of us
                    discovered over the years, that we had to get more than one source for our
                    information. That's the way it was done in many cases. Finding the people that
                    really knew the industry, obviously, was a key. And the offices developed those
                    contacts over the years.</p>
                <p>I might mention in this regard that among the most valuable resources that we had
                    in FAS, and I think you'll agree, were the Foreign National professionals who
                    stayed with our offices for many years, and really knew the key people who had
                    the information, which we needed. They were an invaluable resource, and still
                    are.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Many of them were very highly educated, and some of them
                        had been in the various Ministries. In Bogota, a former Minister of
                        Agriculture applied to me for a job, but we didn't have anything for him.
                        The one we had in Argentina, had also been a high-ranking official .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: And had received some training in the U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right. He'd been through the Point Four or a
                        similar program in Kansas. In some of the Iron Curtain countries, these
                        people were invaluable, but there was considerable personal risk and some
                        actually were imprisoned, not necessarily for what they had done, but they
                        were just under suspicion because they were considered to be working for the
                        enemy.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>WELTON: That's right. We worked with many countries where meat inspection was
                    part of our activities. Not that we were inspectors, but we would arrange for
                    visits by our inspectors, and that was true in Argentina.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also fruit inspections were important.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Yes. I remember when, before my time, when Dick Smith was in El Salvador,
                    just before me. They had to, in effect, tell the meat inspector in Nicaragua
                    that he had to close down General Somoza's plant. This inspector started
                    sweating rather profusely when they told them that. I think he had visions of
                    going before the firing squad shortly thereafter. Those were some of the risks
                    involved.</p>
                <p>Another thing that Jim Howard brought to my attention was that in the early
                    post-war years, although I'm not sure if we had any of these prior to World War
                    II, there were regional commodity specialists that might be located in London,
                    for example. They would travel all over Europe, providing information for the
                    whole region on cotton, fruit, or grain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Didn't we have one of those in Cairo at one time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: There might well have been. I suspect there was. P. K. Norris was one of
                    those, with cotton, I remember. Wheatly Palmer was another one Jim mentioned.
                    Jack Hudson on tobacco, Gordan Boals on grain, and Gordon I know was later the
                    Washington representative of the Millers National Federation, which was a
                    cooperator on flour exports. He was there for a number of years. A fellow named
                    Doc Motz on apples. I don't know if he reported on other fruits as well. And
                    there must have been someone on citrus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes, Henry Burke was a famous character.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: There is some talk of trying to revive something along that line. Our
                    resources from time to time get stretched and we have to reduce posts abroad,
                    and so forth. The question of regional reports is being considered I understand,
                    in the current setting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Other than the London and possibly the Cairo offices, what
                        were some of the other important regional posts that we had in the early
                        days.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>WELTON: They weren't all regional, in the 1920s we had an Attach� in Buenos
                    Aires. In fact, a fellow named Dr. Dilman Bullock was in Buenos Aires from 1920
                    to 1923. And I believe that other than London, Buenos Aires has the longest
                    continuous run of Agricultural Attach�s at post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I didn't realize that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: There may have been a brief period in the 1930s where Buenos Aires was
                    vacated later we had the Balance of Payments (BALPA) cutbacks where we reduced
                    overseas staffing because of budget considerations, and certainly the 1930s was
                    not a plush time for budgets either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think we had to pull the Attach�s out of Buenos Aires
                        temporarily for security reasons, didn't we, a few years ago?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: That's right. But we operated out of Montevideo for a period there during
                    the bad times in the 1970s after our departure. We pulled an assistant, I know,
                    out of B.A. in the 1930s, but it may have been closed for a year or two during
                    that period, I'm not absolutely sure. Anyhow, the other posts in the 1920s were
                    Berlin, Rome — we had a representative to the International Institute that I
                    mentioned earlier; Mexico City, Shanghai, Marseille...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were they concentrating on in Marseille?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I suspect more on competitive crops — maybe fruit. I'm not sure about
                    this, but it could well be. Certainly the focus of some posts was on competition
                    with U.S.A. Agriculture. B.A., Pretoria, Sydney, which were similar posts that
                    opened in the 1920s. I think the only other one was moved between Budapest,
                    Vienna, and Belgrade. That became kind of a regional post for the Balkans and
                    shifted around quite a lot. The Commissioner in Shanghai also had reporting
                    responsibilities for Japan in the late 1920s.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>I may have mentioned that Belgrade is now covered from Sofia, and we've had
                    regional posts shifting in that area from different locations over the years. By
                    1944, the Attach� Service was under the State Department, and some of these
                    posts that I mentioned earlier were still there, but we had added Rio, Ottawa,
                    Havana, and Moscow. A couple of those, I presume, certainly Moscow, had limited
                    staffing before the end of the war, but we were shipping a lot of food there
                    under Lend Lease at the time, and we had Ag reporters in several Latin American
                    countries by 1944, including Caracas. I think Jim Kempton was probably there by
                    then. Fortunately, the late Bob McConnell, whom we knew very well, when he was
                    an area officer, took the Attach� lists that had been utilized in FAS for a
                    number of years, and compiled a series on post staffing by post from 1945 on,
                    which is an excellent place to check on who was where when. It's been very
                    useful to a lot of people.</p>
                <p>I might mention that in 1939, when the Attach�s shifted to the State Department,
                    there were nine Attach�s. At that time we only seem to have seven posts still
                    operating overseas, and the extra two attach�s I assume, were on home leave or
                    assigned here in Washington, but they transferred to the State Department with
                    the Attach� Service. I mentioned earlier that Paul Minneman and Paul Nyhus, and
                    Dawson in China were all on that list. Another old timer was Cliff Taylor who
                    served in Buenos Aires and in New Delhi. And of that group, just a couple
                    reverted back to FAS in 1954. And the only one to serve for an extended period
                    after that was Paul Minneman, who was considered by many of us as Dean of the
                    Attach� Service in the 1960s. He went on to Bonn and Paris, and was there,
                    between those two posts for about 13 years, after 1955. Those are some of the
                    pioneers in the Attach� Service. At the time they switched back to FAS in 1955
                    Taylor was the most senior of the group as a GS-18, with a salary of $14,800.
                    Omer Hermann in Paris and Eric Englund in London were GS-17's.</p>
                <p>After the war was over in 1945, there was a substantial expansion by State in the
                    number of agricultural officers overseas covering agriculture, particularly in
                    Latin America, and we were getting back into Europe after the war. I'm surprised
                    to see in Bob's list, for example, that we were back in Belgium in 1945. It was
                    have been pretty late in 1945. I guess we liberated Belgium at the end of
                    1944.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Most of Belgium, anyway.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I guess that was the Battle of the Bulge, I think was Christmas of 1944.
                    And then there was some further expansion right after World War II.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a rather difficult time, in many ways. That was
                        the time that I came into the Foreign Service IN 1946, as a Foreign Service
                        officer. But I had been assigned to agriculture from the beginning. In those
                        early days, a great many of the agricultural people in the Foreign Service —
                        agricultural officers were essentially wartime temporary appointees. But
                        after, at the end of the war, probably more than half of them, or a large
                        percentage of them, anyway, went back to universities, to the USDA, or to
                        their pre-war pursuits. So that was quite an exodus, and the State
                        Department was rather frantically looking for replacements. When I came in
                        Francis Flood was an Assistant Director of OFAR, and he was on my oral
                        examining board. He asked me a great many questions about agriculture. I
                        asked myself why they were so interested in that, because I was actually a
                        history and government major and hadn't had any formal agricultural training
                        . But anyway, I had always had an interest in agriculture, having grown up
                        on a farm. So they sent me to the USDA graduate school, and I took courses
                        in one thing or another, and learned by experience. But I got most of my
                        training on the job. And there were several that were assigned as Assistant
                        Agricultural Attach�s with limited agricultural background. I know Bob Brand
                        said that the only connection in his background that he could think of was
                        that as an English major, he had taken a course on Piers Plowman, an Old
                        English class. He stayed with the State Department, as did the Foreign
                        Service Officers that had been assigned as Agricultural Attach�s. That was a
                        rather difficult period, those first few years after the war, personnel
                        wise.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: That raises an interesting point, Quentin. I'm sure you found your farm
                    background quite useful and helpful, because I certainly did, in establishing
                    rapport with agriculturalists overseas. I think they appreciated that. Certainly
                    when I came in that was something that was still fairly common. By that time we
                    were hiring largely agricultural economists and frequently they came out of our
                    land grant colleges and had some previous experience or farm background growing
                    up, which we don't find very much anymore, obviously.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There's not a very large pool nowadays.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Not as large, certainly. Also, I think I've read elsewhere that many of
                    the early Attach�s came out of an academic background, and some certainly with
                    Ph.D.s, certainly a larger percentage than we had later. And there were a few
                    that came from diverse backgrounds, even missionaries. I believe Fred Rossiter,
                    one of our early Acting Administrators, on a couple of occasions, had been an
                    agricultural missionary in China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think his parents were missionaries.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>WELTON: That could be. And I mentioned the fellow in Argentina, although I don't
                    think he was ever formally with the agency. He did send in reports from there on
                    sheep and wool in Argentina. And later we've gotten Bryant Wadsworth, whom we
                    hired in trade policy when I was in Washington, who had been a Mormon missionary
                    in Japan and was fluent in Japanese, and so he went back to Japan first as
                    Assistant Attach�, and then as an Agricultural Counselor, and spent a number of
                    years with us in Tokyo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were hiring when I came back from Argentina, in the
                        trade policy area — we were hiring mostly international economists, many of
                        whom had very little agricultural background, but trade negotiations were so
                        important at that time, that many of the agricultural economists did not
                        have the specific training necessary for that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: That was a common background of many during that period, that's correct.
                    And occasionally we would get someone who didn't have much training in either
                    field. We had one that came from Texas that had been head of their international
                    marketing division at the Texas State Department of Agriculture, but his major
                    was in music. I got a call, when I was in the Attach� Service, from one of
                    Senator Tower's staff fellows, who asked me what the requirements were for
                    getting into the Attach� Service, and I gave him the standard report, that we
                    liked to get Ag economists, generally with a master's degree in Ag economics. He
                    said, Well, I know one down there that doesn't have that background. He was
                    referring to the music major, of course. But, many of those turned out to be
                    excellent Attach�s as well. But Ag economists were what we were generally
                    looking for.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We've discussed the key functions of the Agricultural
                        Attach�s on the reporting side. What were some of the other activities in
                        the early days that the attach�s were performing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>WELTON: Generally, I would say, what some of us would refer to as the old-line
                    functions of the Agricultural Attach� in addition to supplying data and reports
                    on a wide range of commodity and livestock products, there was the broad general
                    representation function in which they represented both the Department of
                    Agriculture and the Ambassador on agricultural matters within the country.
                    Certainly along with that, they had a key role of keeping the Ambassador
                    informed of broader agricultural issues and developments that he should know
                    about in managing the post operations in those countries and in developing
                    countries, agriculture was certainly the major economic force. I recall in
                    Central America, the Protocol Officer told me one time that I might have the
                    second most important position there. I assume the Ambassador was first. I
                    recall the Ambassador would love to comment that at every cocktail party that he
                    went to he could see the cotton interests ganging up on one side of the room,
                    and the coffee guys were over in another corner. Sugar was another key commodity
                    there, and they were quite concerned about our import policies on sugar, and in
                    the case of cotton we were competitors, so we were accused of dumping cotton on
                    the world market, and that was a primary concern. So he was quite cognizant of
                    the fact that he needed to be well informed on all of those activities as
                    well.</p>
                <p>And of course, certainly another broad role is servicing the U.S.A. trade in the
                    host country. Often there are importers and exporters who wanted information on
                    the U.S.A. Some of the standard guidance we used to give attach�s going overseas
                    was to get your reports in on time, and take care of visitors. I think that's
                    probably still good advice. When I was serving in Mexico I used to say that I
                    served two countries, maybe three including Mexico, but certainly the U.S.A. and
                    Texas. I had to be aware of and take care of visitors and telephone calls from
                    the border, whenever there was a problem getting some U.S. product in, or maybe
                    something being shipped from Mexico that was causing problems on the other side.
                    Beyond that, depending on the post of course, participating and assisting in
                    international meetings was another role that the Attach� at post would get
                    involved in from time to time. I'm sure you can add a lot from your own
                    experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One activity that wasn't stressed so much in our briefings
                        and instructions when we went to the post, but that at some posts became a
                        very important one, was the AID program. Now the Agricultural Attach� was
                        very useful to those programs, in the sense that he could provide
                        information and so forth, and he had a little more direct access to the
                        Ambassador, and the Ambassador was responsible. And the Ambassador would
                        sometimes put functions on the Agricultural Attach�, somebody he knew and
                        trusted, that went a little bit beyond what FAS in Washington thought was
                        necessary. And you had to walk a kind of tightrope.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>WELTON: Occasionally I know we've had experiences where the Ambassador might be
                    quite interested — In Bolivia he was aware of the development of the soybean
                    industry in Argentina and Brazil, which happened after we were there,
                    fortunately, in Argentina. But he was quite interested in having AID assist with
                    developing the soybean industry in Bolivia, and our people in Washington weren't
                    too enthused about that, in USDA, that is, and the Attach� had to walk a
                    difficult tightrope there between those interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had the experience of having one of my former
                        Ambassadors, who was being transferred to another post, and came to the USDA
                        for a briefing. He was briefed by the Assistant Secretary, and the
                        Ambassador commended me very highly for the fine support I'd given him with
                        the AID program. There were some lifted eyebrows about that as they were
                        thinking — “Why weren't you out there pushing U.S. agricultural products.”
                        It was perfectly understood that there were legitimate functions that the
                        Attach� should and needed to provide in that area. But you had to walk a
                        tightrope.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: In Central America we had a very large AID mission under what we called
                    at the time a Participating Agency Service Agreement — PASA — where they would
                    contract with U.S.A. university technicians to help develop agriculture in the
                    host country. And we had a very good working relationship. They would get
                    together from time to time and I would sit in on their staff meetings and have
                    some input and also get a lot of feedback from them as well.</p>
                <p>Of course reporting was a major function of the Attach� offices prior to 1940. An
                    FAS report in 1970 titled The Agricultural Attach�: His History and His work
                    notes that:</p>
                <p>“Principal developments in then work of the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) in
                    the 1930's included: 1) more emphasis on commodity (rather than area) reporting
                    in the European offices; and(2) a marked increase in participation by FAS
                    officers at international conferences; and (3) a considerable extension in the
                    activities of the agricultural attach�s as advisers to the heads of the
                    embassies or legations to which they were accredited. Foreign projects of a
                    typical year (1936) included appraisals of French wheat policy, of the
                    agricultural production capacity of Germany, of the expansion of cotton
                    production in Argentina, of recent developments in Soviet agriculture, of the
                    present and potential agricultural resources of Manchuria, and of agricultural
                    production in the Philippines.”</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>Those were sort of the old-line functions that the Attach�s took care of back in
                    the old days, and still do today with , perhaps, slightly different priorities.
                    Of course , the two major areas of responsibility that took on a much heavier
                    role in later years were the market promotion function and the trade
                    negotiations functions of the agency. Although I'm sure in the early days they
                    would on occasion have reason to complain to the host government on particular
                    trade actions that involved Ag interests. I was interested in reading that when
                    the transfer was made to the Department of State of the Attach�s in 1939, they
                    did spell out in the Secretary's Memorandum of that time, the functions of OFAR
                    in Washington, which mentioned that one of them was to direct and coordinate the
                    participation of the Department of Agriculture in the reciprocal trade
                    agreements program. I think there was a Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act (RTA) in
                    the late 1930s, but of course, after 1939 World War II was underway, and the RTA
                    was pretty much in abeyance then until after the war. We'll get into that later.
                    And it also mentions as well that USDA would direct and coordinate Agriculture's
                    participation in the development and cooperation programs in Latin America,
                    which had started earlier, and got expanded quite a bit by Point Four in the
                    Truman Administration after the war, to other regions of the world. And some of
                    the OFAR people were quite heavily involved in that activity.</p>
                <p>Someone interviewed Leslie Wheeler, who was Administrator of the old FAS and OFAR
                    for many years, about the shift, and he mentioned that this Memorandum, setting
                    up OFAR, gave the new office specific authority which they in fact had been
                    carrying out under the old FAS, in addition to the staff relationship they had
                    with the Secretary's office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dick, with regard to the technical assistance work that
                        this organization has done over the years, I understand that it goes back a
                        long way. What have you found are the origins of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: One of the first references I found, Quentin, was in 1871 when the
                    Commissioner of Agriculture was at the time — I believe his name was Horace
                    Capron — was asked to head a team to Japan to assist with agricultural
                    development there. I assume this perhaps was Japan's initiative to request
                    assistance from the Department of Agriculture. But this team, I think, developed
                    a plan to develop agriculture in Hokkaido. I believe I read somewhere that this
                    was sort of the origin of the dairy industry in Japan, which Hokkaido I think is
                    still a leading producer area for dairy. And by 1900, I think, a lot of
                    countries had become aware of the research and extension success of agriculture
                    in the United States, and wanted to learn more about it. So they began to send
                    some of their students to study at land grant universities here in the U.S. In
                    fact, as you know, that was a source of some of our good contacts overseas, and
                    some of our Foreign National professionals came out of that experience.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>As I mentioned earlier, a comprehensive technical assistance program began with
                    the cooperation with the America Republics Act in 1939. An Institute of
                    Inter-American Affairs was established in 1942 to work with Latin American
                    republics on technical programs in education, health, and agriculture. Some of
                    our colleagues that were involved with this program early on included Carlos
                    Ortega, who stayed with the agency for many years, and Ross Moore, who was the
                    head of that activity in OFAR. Similar efforts were underway by the OAS, which
                    established an Inter-American Institute for Agricultural Sciences in 1940, set
                    up a research center in Turrialba, Costa Rica, which specialized in postgraduate
                    training for agriculturalists from throughout Latin America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's still in operation, isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Oh yes, it is. I meant to call Quentin West to see just when that was
                    started. He worked there for a couple of years after he retired from the
                    Economic Research Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Unfortunately Quentin West passed away several weeks ago,
                        a week or so before Ray Ioanes was going to interview him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: He certainly would have been a good interviewee, because he had a rich
                    knowledge of USDA's activities. One of my favorite Quentin West stories is this:
                    We were on a trip with Secretary Bergland to the Middle East. There was a
                    reception at the embassy, and a lady was checking us in at the gate, with a list
                    of the names of the Bergland team. One of the fellows from the private sector,
                    Bill Taggert, was in the group. Quentin was rather heavy, but Taggert was much
                    heavier. She asked Quentin if he was Bill Taggert, and he said, “ No, he's the
                    next size.” I enjoyed hearing some of Quentin's stories on that trip. He had
                    come into FAS on the regional side of the agency, and then went to the Economic
                    Research Service (ERS) when that was established in 1961, and later became
                    Administrator of the ERS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During that early period he came to Manila while I was
                        Attach� there in 1959.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I think Ross Moore left the agency about the time that the new FAS was
                    formed in 1954, but some others were in that group. Claude Horn, with whom I
                    worked later in Central America was among them. I'm not sure if Clayton Whipple
                    was in that side of the agency or if he was in the regional branches, which I'm
                    sure were heavily involved with the technical assistance part of it, certainly
                    for Latin America.</p>

                <p>I mentioned OAS, but of course FAO was established in 1945, and FAO was also
                    heavily involved in technical development assistance. I had an experience with
                    FAO in El Salvador. They sent an agricultural economist from Israel. And since
                    not many Agricultural attach�s from other countries were there, he sort of
                    adopted me as his confidant, and would come by to see me frequently. We would
                    visit on developments there. He came in all excited one day, and said that he
                    had found just the product for El Salvador, that was produced in only three
                    countries in the world. And I said, “ Mohair? “ And he looked at me sort of
                    aghast, and he said, How did you know that? So I had to confess that I was a
                    mohair specialist in FAS in my early years. But I don't believe that they ever
                    did do much with Angora goats. Anyway, he tried.</p>
                <p>And of course our good friend Afif Tannous was heavily involved in this activity,
                    particularly after it got expanded to other areas such as the Middle East, which
                    was and still is his area of expertise, and for which he has a worldwide
                    reputation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, we were very fortunate to be able to get a fairly
                        lengthy interview with him last year some time. He just celebrated his 90th
                        birthday, I believe, and he is still very alert and has a fantastic
                        memory.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I should run this section by him, to see if he has anything to add later
                    on, but I think he covered it well in his interview. I should also mention that
                    the OFAR had a key role in developing the Point Four section of President
                    Truman's speech, which of course broadened the technical assistance to other
                    areas of the world — the Middle East, Africa, and Asia, after World War II.</p>
                <p>Another related activity that got involved about that time was land reform. You
                    will remember Wolf Ladejinsky was the top Ag man for General MacArthur after
                    World War II.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. He was the father of the Japanese land reform
                        program. And he's venerated in Japan. A Japanese professor who had known and
                        worked with Wolf, and visited me when I was working with the Jaenke
                        Associates, about 7 or 8 years ago. And he brought me a very laudatory
                        biographic sketch of Wolf he had written, primarily concerning the work that
                        he had done in planning and implementing the land reform program.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Then he went back as Attach� to Tokyo in 1950-1954.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Our friend Joe Dodson was one of his assistants in Japan
                        during that time. Joe was later an Attach� in Tokyo, wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>WELTON: Yes. Land reform, as Afif said, became taboo when the Republicans came in
                    in 1953. The technical assistance activity was considerably scaled back when the
                    new FAS was set up in 1954. Afif, I believe was the liaison for FAS with the
                    development side of State and the AID predecessor agencies that were there at
                    the time. Afif also mentioned that development assistance had drawn considerable
                    flak in the late 1940s from California agricultural interests. This led to quite
                    a reduction in OFAR staff at that time. I was going to mention on Wolf
                    Ladejinsky that OFAR had sponsored an international conference on land reform at
                    the University of Wisconsin. I think that was in the early 1950s. Ross Moore
                    left to join ICA, which was the AID predecessor at that point. Wolf had also
                    left to join ICA by 1954, when FAS was set up. I also believe, and you may know
                    this better than I, that he was a victim of the McCarthy hearings at that
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Exactly. He was forced out eventually. He had relatives
                        still in the Soviet Union, and he was hounded out of FAS and became the
                        agricultural advisor to Diem, the Prime Minister of Vietnam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I didn't know that, or that he still had relatives in the Soviet Union. I
                    didn't know that was his origin. That's interesting.</p>
                <p>So technical assistance was phased down considerably in 1954 in the new FAS, and
                    the only major activity I recall when I came into the agency in 1956, was the
                    foreign training division, which arranged training for foreign graduate students
                    and others in the United States with the university land-grant colleges and
                    other facilities around the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Cannon Hearne was heading that up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Yes, and I guess he was the head of it for the next 20 years, a long
                    time. And then when the Kennedy Administration came in in 1960, that activity, I
                    believe originally went with the new Economic Research Service, which took the
                    regional and country area specialists out of FAS, which was still a major
                    activity in 1956. Some well known FASers who had been around for a long time,
                    like Hans Richter, and Lois Bacon, Mary Long and Wilhelm Anderson went to ERS.
                    So that was a major loss to the agency. And they also set up a separate agency
                    for the development side, IADS, International Agricultural Development Service,
                    headed by Les Brown, who became famous for his famine predictions in the book:
                    Man, Land and Food. Les was a graduate student with me at the University of
                    Maryland. I didn't know him all that well, but I'm sure we had some courses
                    together. And he's still on the scarcity bandwagon — China is his latest theme.
                    And one of these days it may turn out...</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He is the president of the World Watch Institute. They do
                        a lot of good research, but many people think he's gone a little far in his
                        predictions of drastic scarcities that he sees in the fairly near
                        future.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I believe that activity came back to FAS briefly — the development
                    activity — maybe when Dave Hume was Administrator, which was in 1974. But then
                    when the Carter Administration came in in 1977, they established the Office of
                    International Cooperation and Development as a separate agency. But that has
                    recently come back now in the latest reorganization plan, which began during the
                    closing stages of the Bush Administration, and has been carried out by the
                    Clinton Administration. That activity is back with FAS. The only major activity
                    which we had in the early years, which is still in the Economic Research
                    Service, was the regional expertise and country specialists. And those I think
                    still do the food balance sheets, which I guess they may have been doing since
                    World War II. It was probably started during the war. Obviously scarcity was a
                    concern then and I recall reading that the Attach�'s primary responsibility at
                    the outset of World War II was to locate exportable supplies of foodstuffs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suspect they did start during the war.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I might add at this point another major activity, which has been in and
                    out over the years, is the Office of the General Sales Manager. I believe that
                    started as a separate activity with the Kennedy Administration. You remember
                    when Ed Jaenke came to Buenos Aires, he came with Frank LaRoux who I think was
                    the first General Sales manager with that title. I suppose about that time the
                    PL 480 activity was transferred over to that agency and it gained agency status—
                    as the Export Marketing Service in 1969.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then it was brought back into FAS, but I don't
                        remember exactly when.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I'll have to check that too. [It came back in 1975, but has retained a
                    certain degree of autonomy in operating the PL 480 and CCC credit programs.]</p>
                <p>An interesting operation. It's been in and out over the years, largely because of
                    the insistence of one man, Jamie Whitten, Chairman of the Agricultural
                    Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee. Now that he's gone perhaps they
                    will be able to keep it in FAS. As you know, Jamie Whitten had one theme which
                    he harped on annually in the budget hearings, that the CCC had the authority to
                    sell agricultural products, and that's what they ought to be doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He strongly believed that should be our program; put CCC
                        surpluses on the market and sell them.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>WELTON: That's right — for whatever they would bring. Even in the height of the
                    scarcity period, in the early '70s, when grain prices shot through the roof, he
                    didn't miss a beat. He still harped on the fact that we ought to be out there
                    pushing our products, for whatever we can get for them. Anyhow, that's now
                    history. Although these things have a way of cropping up again from time to
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Congressmen who have agriculture as one of their
                        primary concerns — they are rapidly dwindling. We may not have quite as much
                        of that in the future.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: That's true. Perhaps one indication of this is that we now have for the
                    first time a career head of the General Sales Manager's wing of the FAS, Chris
                    Goldthwaite, who had been Acting for several years, and was named head of the
                    General Sales Manager's office in recent years. It's also curious to note Chris
                    is a Harvard graduate, and the current Administrator is also a Harvard graduate.
                    I don't think we've ever had two Harvard graduates in such high positions in
                    FAS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We wouldn't have had it in Jamie Whitten's heyday. Also, I
                        think it's interesting that this new agriculture bill which has been passed
                        by the Senate is a pretty drastic revision of the original farm legislation,
                        which has been in effect since 1949, and which is still the basic
                        legislation for agriculture, though drastically amended, from time to
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: It would boost the cost of our programs by a huge amount if they didn't
                    enact new legislation to supersede current legislation as it expires.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Otherwise the legislation would revert back to the
                        original language.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>WELTON: The other area that I touched on briefly, but hadn't gotten into in very
                    much detail, is the trade policy area of FAS. I did go back and review some of
                    the yearbook chapters on trade policy, which were written by such renowned
                    experts as Clayton Yuetter, who was later Secretary of Agriculture, and the
                    President's Special Trade Representative. I think the order is reversed — first
                    Special Trade Representative and then Secretary. And of course, was Assistant
                    Secretary when I went to Mexico in 1974. His chapter mentions that the first
                    trade agreement was negotiated with Germany, in 1844. But it was never ratified,
                    and the first one to be ratified and take effect was in 1855 with Canada. Also,
                    the 1890 Trade Act was the first to authorize trade agreements without approval
                    of Congress, which of course is key, because Congress has seldom looked very
                    favorably on trade agreements. Then, I was also curious to learn Ray Ioanes
                    wrote a little earlier, in the 1964 yearbook, that by 1940, agreements had been
                    negotiated with 29 countries, which surprised me. I didn't think we'd been that
                    active prior to World War II. But the sharp decline in farm prices after World
                    War I led to a succession of tariff acts I mentioned earlier, which culminated
                    in the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930. This, of course, has been shown to have
                    been very restrictive trade legislation, which hampered our trade for quite a
                    period. But from then on, there were a series of trade acts to reduce tariffs on
                    farm products and other commodities. Ray mentioned that the 1930 Act had raised
                    the average tariff on farm products to 85 percent. And Ag exports had fallen by
                    more than 50 percent during the early '30s, which of course were the Depression
                    years. We had Ag surpluses and programs to cut back on production. You remember
                    this period better than I.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the Henry Wallace era. We took a lot of heat for
                        killing the little pigs in trying to reduce the pork surplus.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I don't think that program lasted very long. But certainly the ploughing
                    up of grain and programs to curtail acreage in basic crops has been an integral
                    part of farm programs ever since.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It may be on its way out at this point.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>WELTON: They're trying to phase it out but I'm still skeptical that we won't have
                    another period down the road where surpluses are a problem and there will be an
                    effort to reinstate some of the acreage control programs. Getting back to trade
                    policy, the Reciprocal Trade Agreement Act of 1934 helped turn the Smoot-Hawley
                    Tariff Act around and reduce these average tariffs about 55 percent by the time
                    World War II started. The war caused a hiatus in all of that activity,
                    obviously. One thing they did do, during the war, was to set up the
                    interdepartmental committee to consider how to reestablish world trade, after
                    World War II. This was probably the predecessor organization of the one we were
                    familiar with in the '70s, and which I think continues to this day — what we
                    called at one time the Trade Staff Committee. I'm not sure what they call it
                    today, but a similar type of organization that involves trade experts from
                    Agriculture, Commerce, State, Tariff Commission, Labor, and all the other
                    agencies around town, who sit around the table and discuss different types of
                    trade actions that Agriculture , or others, might want to pursue to lower
                    barriers, or in some cases to try to raise them.</p>
                <p>Another thing that was started in 1945, actually, was that the U.S. invited some
                    15 countries to a conference on international trade and employment. That
                    conference was at Hot Springs, VA. The GATT followed in 1947, and we've had a
                    whole series of trade negotiating rounds since then. One thing on the trade
                    policy side that I found interesting in reading Reed Dunn's story on his work
                    with the cotton council was the Farm Bureau's role. He mentioned that the cotton
                    sector had been strong supporters of free trade in the New Deal era, but at that
                    time the Farm Bureau supported protectionism which I think is quite different
                    from their current stance in recent years, they've been strong supporters of the
                    trade agreements to reduce tariffs, and also have been strong supporters of
                    reducing USA price supports so that our products can compete in world trade.
                    Another key development in the 1940's was the signing of the International Wheat
                    Agreement in 1949. I had mentioned that there have always been groups very
                    active in resisting free trade in some areas of agriculture. Section 22 of the
                    Agriculture Adjustment Act of 1935 provided for import controls when imports
                    interfered with domestic price support programs, and that led to a quota system
                    for dairy products, wheat and flour, and peanuts. Sugar was covered by the
                    Jones-Costigan Act of 1934, but imports have been fairly tightly controlled
                    since that time for sugar. And then meat imports, particularly beef, were
                    controlled a bit later, under Section 204 of the Agriculture Act of 1956, which
                    set up voluntary restraint programs, which we've had with the major suppliers,
                    Australia and New Zealand, from time to time. Those were first applied in 1964.
                    But all of that has been superseded by the signing of the Uruguay Round
                    Agreement, which became effective January 1, 1995. Those quotas have been
                    replaced by tariff quotas, which are quite a bit more liberal, certainly in the
                    case of beef, than the previous ...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Has Section 22 actually been superseded now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Yes, it has.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Section 22 in the years that I was the U.S. delegate to
                        the GATT Agriculture Committee in Geneva, was one of the major targets of
                        our trading competitors, that I had to be constantly defending. We clung to
                        that through all the trade negotiations and the multilateral trade
                        agreements over the years, which the Common Market and other competitors
                        resented tremendously. And that was the source of much of the friction in
                        our trade negotiations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: It was certainly a major bargaining chip in our negotiations,
                    particularly with the Common Market, their variable levy system that we wanted
                    to get under the same controls with a maximum tariff and tariff quotas which
                    were all on the table.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess the Uruguay Round was the first negotiation in
                        which both the EC and the U.S. finally made rather significant changes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I think that's right. In fact, that agreement, the so-called Blair House
                    Agreement, probably held up the completion of the Uruguay Round for a couple of
                    years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, many people thought at the time that it would destroy
                        it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I remember there was a cartoon on one of the doors in FAS in the trade
                    policy area. Carla Hills saying that “ This Uruguay Round negotiation will
                    absolutely be finished by the end of 1992... “ , or maybe it was even earlier
                    than that, but it was the end of 1994 when they actually reached agreement and
                    it took effect on January 1, 1995.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have gone into this to some extent in my own interview,
                        but the major argument that we had in support of Section 22 restrictions was
                        that we also had in our farm legislation that the production controls and
                        what we were arguing with the Common Market at that time was that very few
                        of our competitors had as stringent production controls as we had. They had
                        subsidies, but pretty well open-ended in most instances as far as production
                        was concerned. And there was considerable logic in our argument, but we
                        didn't have all that much support from other agencies in our position. We
                        fought very hard, and I think some of our trade negotiators, Ray Ioanes was
                        the leader for many years in that effort. And Ernest Koenig, when he was
                        stationed in Brussels and Geneva — certainly he did a lot of good work in
                        that area. But in many instances, we didn't have much support from other
                        agencies, and outright opposition from many in the State Department. Those
                        were very difficult years to be involved in the trade policy area.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Yes. Another bone of contention was that the U.S. had gotten a waiver in
                    the original GATT legislation, which permitted us to continue the Section 22
                    restrictions. I guess there was an annual review of that waiver, wasn't there,
                    that was defended all the time?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and there was constant review in the committee in
                        Geneva.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I'll probably get into some of the trade rounds a bit more later. I just
                    wanted to go back and pick up some of this early history on trade policy. We
                    have, as you know, a staffing pattern of FAS at the time the new FAS was formed
                    in 1954. Oscar Zaglits headed up the trade policy area in OFAR at the time. And
                    I think you mentioned that he said it was pretty much a one-man division. He
                    didn't have anywhere near the staff that we were familiar with when we came back
                    from Argentina. We had two divisions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even a few years before that when P. K. Norris was heading
                        up that work. He had about 2 or-3 assistants and a couple of secretaries,
                        and that was about the size of the trade policy organization.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: But now they have six divisions, including a new office for food safety
                    and the trade statistics staff. Now they must have about 50 people in that area.
                    Most of that expansion began with the Kennedy Round and certainly grew during
                    the Tokyo Round. And of course the Uruguay Round later. Talking about the size
                    of the agency, we might go back and look at some of the budget figures. I
                    recalled seeing a photo of the FAS picnic in 1934. There are about 30 people
                    there, including approximately 10 dependents. So I would guess at that time we
                    probably had no more than 50-60 in all of FAS, including 10-20 in the field. I
                    mentioned those numbers to Ralph Phillips, who was in China during World War II
                    with OFAR, and he said that sounded about right to him. On the budget side,
                    going back to that picture, you'll notice that there are two long-time Attach�s
                    there: Dr. C. C. Taylor, and Paul Nyhus. They may have been on home leave, or
                    assigned to Washington at the time. Lazar Volan, who was our Russian expert was
                    also there. I was intrigued that we had a Russian expert back that far. I don't
                    think we had a lot of trade with Russia in those days but they may have been
                    grain exporters then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't think he was hired, nor did he serve as a Russian
                        expert, actually.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: That may be, although he certainly was after the war, when I came in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was Oscar Zaglits, who isn't in this group, but he
                        must have come in fairly soon afterwards. Most of these people were still in
                        what became OFAR. I think this was the original FAS, perhaps, in 1934.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It had become OFAR, but most of the people in the picture,
                        including an early FAS director, Les Wheeler were still on the job when I
                        came in 1946.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Several of these were still around when I came in 1956, including Volin
                    and Leo Shaben. This FAS newsletter was printed in 1965, and they mention that
                    two of them, Ruth Donovan and Louis Fillius were still at FAS at that time.
                    Volin and another lady, Geniama Edwards, were in ERS by then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Louise Fillius worked in my office when I came back from
                        Bogota in 1955, as Reports and Training Officer. I believe that she had
                        started to work for — I'm not sure if it was in USDA or not, but she started
                        to work for the government during World War I, and she retired not too long
                        after that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: She was still there in 1965, so it was probably shortly after that.</p>
                <p>I mentioned the agency grew rapidly in the mid-50s after the new FAS was
                    organized in 1954. Of course, Public Law 480 helped a great deal in providing
                    funding for that growth and the expansion — particularly of the trade programs
                    and market development side of the agency. Staffing in those areas had been very
                    limited before that time. By the early '80s, the number had leveled off at about
                    800, with some 120 Americans overseas and 180 foreign nationals at some 70 posts
                    abroad, covering some 110 countries. I think we're over 1,000 now with the
                    addition of the OICD staff, which came back to the agency last year. But
                    overseas I don't think our full numbers have varied a great deal since that
                    time. In fact, the recent budget figures show a slight decline in overseas
                    personnel since 1985. We've had some shifts in posts of course, and some of the
                    smaller posts are part of a regional grouping, and we just have one foreign
                    national at a number of those. One of your old posts, Brussels, at the embassy,
                    is now a post covered by our man in the Hague. We still have a sizeable
                    contingent of course, at the USA Mission office, in Brussels covering the
                    European Union.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>I think I'd mentioned earlier on the budget side was that Congress allocated
                    $1,000 in 1839 to the Patent Office, before USDA was established, to collect
                    statistics abroad. By 1934, that had jumped to $23,000, which was allocated to
                    the Bureau of Agricultural Economics (BAE), to gather information on markets for
                    American agricultural products in Europe and the Orient. I should also mention
                    that funding for FAS in 1930/31 came from the Federal Farm Board, the precursor
                    of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) which was created in 1933. We also
                    found reference to the budget in 1939, when the Attach�s shifted to State. The
                    FAS budget was $300,000. I don't know if that was just for the overseas portion,
                    but I don't think so. $100,000 was shifted to State to pay the cost of the
                    Attach� Service. Of course, as I mentioned Before we only had about 9 Attach�s
                    who were transferred to State in that reorganization, so it was still very
                    small. In 1954, when the Attach�s returned to FAS, I saw some material from Art
                    Minor — you know he was our Assistant Administrator for Management for many
                    years — and was heavily involved in that process. USDA requested $1.2 million
                    from Congress to run the new FAS, including $400,000 from State to offset the
                    switch of the Attach�s. Congress eventually authorized $800,000, all to be
                    transferred from the State Department. By the mid-80s, the funding for the
                    Attach� Service was about $20 million, and recently it was nearly $40 million,
                    and the total FAS budget was about $130 million. We're talking real money here.
                    I mentioned that the total staff had gotten up to about 900, with some 260 in
                    the field in 1995. I think that might be before the shift back of the OICD.</p>
                <p>I might also note at this point that the current FY 1996 budget proposes a number
                    of new posts including Vietnam, the Ukraine and Kazakhstan, plus six new
                    agricultural trade offices: Shanghai, two in Latin America, Russia, and Africa.
                    The total of those that they'll get — that seems a bit optimistic for one year,
                    and even if they are authorized, that doesn't always mean, as you know, that
                    they get filled. We still have to convince the Department of State to let us
                    have offices in some of these places. Sometimes they resist our closing offices,
                    and they also often resist opening new offices in some countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The State Department is being — I get the Foreign Service
                        Journal — they are being hurt pretty badly in these budget reductions, so I
                        can understand their concern about anything that increases the load on
                        State, any new additions of ours, which in one way or another will have
                        repercussions on their budget. The Embassy would be resistant, I'm sure.
                        They'd have to be fully remunerated for it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: There's a transfer of funds for administrative support, which of course
                    is involved when we open new posts abroad. One interesting or curious
                    development in the past year has been that Senator Helms, who is not known as a
                    staunch supporter of the State Department —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let it be known that that's irony.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>WELTON: ...also proposed that all of the trade functions go back to the
                    Department of State from both Agriculture and Commerce — but I believe that
                    wiser heads have prevailed. That proposal did not go very far.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But Senator Helms did hold up not only all nominations for
                        Ambassadors in key positions, but also the ratification of some very
                        important treaties on disarmament. He held it up for a couple of years
                        almost, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: He did hold up a lot of Ambassadors' appointments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All of that has been freed, and the START agreements have
                        finally been ratified.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: The next thing we might discuss a bit are the early Administrators. We
                    mentioned Leslie Wheeler, who was not the first Administrator — well, I use the
                    term Administrator, but we should clarify that, prior to 1954, the people that
                    we talk about were all Directors of either the old FAS in the Bureau of
                    Agricultural Economics, or the Office of Foreign Agricultural Relations, the old
                    OFAR. They had the title of Director rather than Administrator.</p>
                <p>The first Director of the old FAS was Asher Hobson. I think he had probably been
                    in the Bureau for some years. He probably retired in 1931, so he was just there
                    for a short time after FAS became a separate Division in 1930. Leslie Wheeler
                    then became Acting, and a few years later in 1934 became Director, where he
                    remained until 1948, so he was there for practically 17 years, the longest
                    running head of the organization. And Jim Howard, who also died recently, and
                    who has been heavily involved in this operation of oral history interviews, did
                    talk with Duncan Wall, who was head of the Information Division in OFAR for a
                    couple years, about Les Wheeler. I guess he had left before Jim came into FAS.
                    Did you know Wheeler at all?</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not very well, he was the director when I came in, but for
                        the first nine years of my service, from early 1947 until I came back from
                        Bogota in late 1955. I was overseas continuously, except for nine months at
                        Harvard, studying international economics and agricultural economics. So I
                        met Les Wheeler several times, but really didn't get to know him.</hi>

                <p>WELTON: I gather from Jim's conversation with Duncan Wall that he was rather an
                    intellectual type, as he said he was a very bright man. I guess he must have had
                    some abilities to stay in that position that long. And he didn't remember
                    exactly why he left. He left the agency, I believe, to head up an Aid mission in
                    Latin America, but he had gotten some criticism, I think, as a result of the
                    transfer of Attach�s out of FAS in the late '30s. I mentioned that the
                    development assistance side became rather big during the war, and there was some
                    resistance to that from some of the agricultural interests in the U.S. So it
                    appears that he probably decided that he might be better suited for ICA or AID
                    at that time. And some of the early ones also left via that route were Stanley
                    Andrews, who I think was heavily involved with Ray Ioanes in the German recovery
                    program after World War II.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The German mafia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I think we called them the German Club also. As you know, there were a
                    number of those in FAS in the early years. Francis Flood, although he didn't go
                    to ICA, opted to remain with State as an FSO in 1954.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Francis was one of my bosses in Canada, my first post. I
                        knew Francis very well. He was Acting Director of OFAR for just a few
                        months. He'd been the Associate Director for some time — in fact, he was
                        Associate Director at the time that he was on my oral examining board for
                        the Foreign Service and recommended that I be slotted for Agriculture, after
                        I was appointed as a Foreign Service officer. Francis had asked me a number
                        of agricultural questions, and having been raised on a farm, I knew
                        something about it, although I had not studied agriculture in college. I was
                        actually a history and government major. But then OFAR gave me a few months
                        intensive training, including special courses at the Department of
                        Agriculture's Graduate School. Then I was sent to Ottawa early in 1947 as
                        Assistant Agricultural Attach� and Francis took over the Attach� slot later
                        that years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: After Wheeler left, we had quite a series of Directors — well, Stanley
                    Andrews was there for a couple of years, but other than he, there was a series
                    of either Acting or Directors for the next few years. Even during the early
                    years of the new FAS, there were a number of short term Agency heads. Between
                    1952 and 1955 7 different Administrators, including several that were just
                    Acting for a short time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Fred Rossiter one of those?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Fred was Acting on two different occasions. Then he became Attach� in
                    Canada for a number of years, about 9 years, after FAS was established.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I knew Fred quite well. I think he was the son of
                        missionaries in China.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Yes, I believe Jim Howard mentioned that his father was an agricultural
                    missionary in China. A couple of them: Francis Flood, and I believe John
                    Haggerty, that were in this group, then went to the field — I think both of them
                    stayed with State when the Attach�s transferred back in 1954.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, Francis became a Consul General in Scotland.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I've mentioned that two of them had stayed with the State Department when
                    the Attach�s transferred back in 1954, including Jack Haggerty. He came back
                    then from State and didn't come back to FAS, but Dick Goodman was telling me
                    that he was on the Food and Fiber Commission that Hubert Humphrey set up in the
                    early 1960s. Woody Berg, who had been our Attach� in Denmark, and later became
                    Dean of Agriculture at the University of Minnesota, was the main man there, but
                    Haggerty was delegated to pull a lot of stuff together for that committee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Woody Berg was one of the early graduates of the training
                        course I set up in 1956. He told me many years later that he had found that
                        course very helpful.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: You trained him very well. Then when we had the change of Administration,
                    of course, the Republicans came in with the Eisenhower Administration, after the
                    Democrats had been in office almost throughout the years of the old FAS, and the
                    old OFAR as well. Of course, there was quite a turnover, and a couple of the new
                    guys didn't last very long either. Francis Wilcox was the first Acting Director,
                    and I think he was there just two months. I gather he was from Sunkist, and
                    maybe he decided government service wasn't for him, and Sunkist looked better.
                    Anyhow, he didn't last very long. And then the name that really intrigued me was
                    Romeo Short, who was actually the first Administrator of the new FAS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He didn't last very long either.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: No, he sure didn't. He lasted four months. Then he became Assistant
                    Secretary. But he only lasted about two months there. I don't know whether he
                    ran afoul of the Secretary, or the White House, or what. But he didn't survive
                    very long.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he from the Farm Bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>WELTON: Yes, he was. One of these quirks of timing. He was the head of the
                    Arkansas Farm Bureau. And then Vice President of the National Farm Bureau. But I
                    thought if he had just come to Washington in 1994, instead of '54, he might have
                    been Secretary of Agriculture. Anyway, he was short-lived with FAS. I don't know
                    if he was short, or a Romeo either. I don't think we had many Romeos as
                    Administrators, but there were a few that were short.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who followed Short then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Fred Rossiter was Acting for a period again, and our friend Clayton
                    Whipple.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes. And Clayton was a short timer also?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Yes, but Clayton stayed around quite a while, as Deputy Administrator for
                    several years. In fact, he was the one who recruited me at the University of
                    Maryland, and talked me into coming to FAS. Clayton had a great job teaching a
                    course at Maryland in international agriculture, but he'd bring his tobacco
                    division chief, or some of the regional branch chiefs down to give a lecture
                    every week. He was mostly just a rapporteur, and introduced the speakers, but
                    didn't have to prepare the lectures. Some colleagues note that his work habits
                    with FAS followed a similar pattern.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Gwynn Garnett then follow?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: No, Bill Lodwick.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill Lodwick was from Mount Pleasant, Iowa, which is 25
                        miles from my hometown. And of course his son still farms in that area. I
                        was talking to him just a few weeks ago.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: The son Seeley became Assistant Secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But Bill went to Mexico as Attach�, following that, for a
                        few years. And at that time, I think that's when Gwynn Garnett came in.
                        Gwynn had just taken over not too long before I came back from Bogota in
                        1955.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Gwynn was Administrator when I came to work in 1956 and he was
                    Administrator until 1958. And Gwynn, of course, was a very dynamic
                    individual.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. He was also from the Farm Bureau.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Gwynn also died recently. He was certainly one of the architects of the
                    PL 480 agreement. His obituary, I noticed, mentioned that during his experience
                    in Germany, he'd gotten the idea that if countries could use their own currency,
                    they would be in a better position to import agricultural products, and use them
                    for the development of their economies. So that was the kind of thing (PL 480)
                    that gave FAS a big boost in the 1950's and later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Farm Bureau got behind it and helped push it
                        through.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: And I guess by that time, too, the surpluses were building up and were
                    becoming quite a concern, so I imagine it was certainly very easy to get a lot
                    of support from the farm state legislators for PL 480. Which I believe was
                    called a temporary surplus disposal program, which is still around 40 years
                    later. Although there's been some talk that it may be now phased out. If so,
                    USDA would rely more on its credit programs we have to sell abroad in developing
                    countries.</p>
                <p>And then we had Max Myers from South Dakota for a couple of years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I may have unwittingly helped to recruit Max. I went to
                        South Dakota State on a recruiting mission which took in a tour of seven
                        land grant colleges. Max was the head of the agricultural economics
                        department at South Dakota State, and he set up my appointments. Then, not
                        too many months after that, he came to Washington as Administrator.
                        Actually, negotiations had already been going on were before I got there,
                        which I hadn't been told about!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: He probably didn't leave a very great impact on the agency. But Ioanes
                    was his deputy, and of course Ioanes became Administrator in 1962.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But in the meantime, of course, Bob Tetro was the
                        immediate successor of Max.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Max was forced out when Truman came in as Secretary in 1961 with
                    Kennedy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tetro became Administrator, and then was Administrator for
                        a little over one year. We had our World Attach� Conference in May 1962,
                        which I came up from Buenos Aires for, and I think the turnover had been in
                        April of that year.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Actually, I guess he wasn't officially — I thought he'd probably taken
                    over in January, but according to this he wasn't on board until March of
                    1961.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, he actually, for all practical purposes, had taken
                        over in January. But it didn't become official until a couple of months
                        later. And then almost exactly a year later Ioanes took over and Bob went to
                        Rome. Bob died in 1991, I think it was. Bob had had a long history of
                        service in FAS. He'd been Attach� in Rome and Buenos Aires, and then came
                        back from Buenos Aires to be Assistant Administrator for Ag Attach�s, and I
                        was on his staff as Reports and Training Officers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I guess he was the first Assistant Administrator for Attach�s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that's true.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I think there was a period when Attach�s and some of the other programs
                    were lumped together, but I believe Tetro was the first Assistant Administrator
                    in the modern setup that's pretty much continued since that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think one of Bob's problems was that he was very much
                        interested in the international organizations, and had been for years. And
                        that was one of his priority interests. And people like Jamie Whitten, and
                        many other legislators, didn't give a damn about international
                        organizations... And many of the farm groups in the U.S. I think that that
                        was one of his major problems. And Ioanes who had been Deputy Administrator
                        for a number of years replaced him. Ioanes had come in after he came back
                        from Germany. He was a Special Assistant, or some such title, to Gwynn
                        Garnett. Ioanes recruited me, came to Bogota and interviewed me for the job
                        of Reports and Training Officer which I took over in late 1955.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Ioanes was then Administrator for 11 years. His was the second longest
                    tenure in the organization's history after Wheeler's.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And he remained Administrator until he retired,
                        actually.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: And he of course had been Deputy Administrator, or certainly had had a
                    key role in the agency, almost from the beginning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Chief Operating Officer, you might say. Max Myers had
                        had no experience in government, and he just didn't really get hold of that
                        very different job too well. A very capable, very nice guy, but he just
                        didn't fit in that slot.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>WELTON: Ioanes was quite a dynamic individual, and still is. And commanded a lot
                    of respect in the interagency forum.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A brilliant mind. His breadth of knowledge was just
                        amazing. He seemed to be in touch with everything. He always conducted
                        himself very well, and was very impressive at hearings and meetings when he
                        met with the congressional committees, because he was so knowledgeable and
                        always seemed to know everything about everything that they were discussing.
                        He was widely respected, but not always liked by his contemporaries in the
                        State Department and other departments. Aggravating sometimes, because he
                        was very — what term would you use to describe his —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: He wasn't soft spoken. Diplomacy, perhaps, was not one of his fortes,
                    either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And he'd be the first to admit — in fact, I was just
                        talking to him the other day, and he made a comment somewhat along those
                        lines.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I think he could be rather hard on his inner circle at times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a very demanding boss with a hands-on style - did
                        not delegate much authority.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I never saw too much temper in the broader agency staff meetings,
                    although I remember when I retired, I got a nice letter from Bryant Wadsworth,
                    who served in Japan and a number of other posts. He came in while I was in Trade
                    Policy, and worked for us for a while. He said that his first staff meeting was
                    one where one of the staff kind of took on Ioanes, and it ended rather abruptly.
                    That was his introduction to FAS. That was an exception, but I think some also
                    perhaps criticized him for browbeating people, so that he didn't get as much
                    interaction as maybe he should have. But not many people wanted to take him on,
                    that was for sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But he got things done.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Yes, he was very effective. I remember one of our longtime Attach� wives
                    — she had worked, actually, in FAS, in the Information Division. She said she
                    always thought of Ioanes as the prototype of an Administrator, and I thought
                    that was very well said.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>David Hume — we had a series of career administrators after Max Myers: Tetro,
                    Ioanes, and then Dave Hume, who was highly regarded within the agency and
                    outside too. He had headed up the Dairy and Poultry Division, and then I think
                    he was in charge of the market development side for a while. He had been an
                    Assistant Administrator, and then had served in Tokyo and London two of the
                    largest posts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, he was Attach� in London when I was in Brussels. He
                        was then Administrator until he retired.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I think he would have stayed longer if there hadn't been a change in
                    Administrations. The Carter Administration came in and kind of eased him out a
                    few months later. And then Tom Hughes was Administrator, who had been...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then didn't we have a series of non-careers, as far as FAS
                        was concerned, for a while.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Not a series, really, because Dick Smith came after Hughes. Hughes had
                    been on Secretary Freeman's staff, and I think you may know this; I'm not sure
                    this is correct. That he was a roommate of Mondale? I think he was Mondale's
                    roommate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are you sure it wasn't Freeman? Anyway, he was one of his
                        top staff people when Freeman became Secretary.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: He had a very good Deputy, in Tom Saylor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From the Hill, I believe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: He was widely admired by the staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He knew government, he knew agriculture, Tom Saylor
                        did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Tom Hughes was very temperamental, and he, I don't think, fully trusted
                    the career staff. But he was able to accomplish some things there. And then Dick
                    Smith took over for five years, came into the agency about the same time I did,
                    and had grown up with the agency, and also rubbed some people the wrong way at
                    times, but I think he was successful. He was certainly in charge too. I don't
                    think there was any question about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Although he jokingly said that he was the first
                        Administrator who saw exports go down.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Almost steadily. They set a record in 1981 and didn't surpass it until
                    last year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't think people blamed Dick. There were extraneous
                        causes of that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: And then another non-career appointee, Tom Kay, who had been the FAS
                    legislative liaison, and I think had also been across the street as
                    congressional liaison for the Department as a whole. I'm not sure, but I think
                    maybe he was a Deputy Assistant for International Programs for a period, and he
                    left when the Bush Administration came in. I remember he said when he left that
                    he was bipartisan, because he'd been fired by both the Democrats and the
                    Republicans. Ioanes was the other way around: he had survived both the Democrats
                    and the Republicans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bud Anderson?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Bud Anderson came back then. A long-time career Attach�. In fact, Bud was
                    supposed to come back earlier to replace Tom. No, that was it; maybe that's
                    where the confusion comes in on the Assistant Secretary slot, Tom was named for
                    either the Deputy or maybe the Assistant Secretary position at that time, but
                    ran into some flak and it never got approved. In fact, I was slated to go to
                    London myself, to replace Bud at that time, if he had come back. But that didn't
                    get worked out. Then Tom left in 1989 and Bud came in as Acting for a while, and
                    then was Administrator for about two years.</p>
                <p>Then we had another political appointee, Duane Acker, who had been head of OICD,
                    and in fact, that's probably where the recombination kind of got its roots. He
                    was acting head of OICD for a period while he was also Administrator of FAS.
                    Later he moved across the street into one of the Assistant Secretary positions
                    in mid-1992, and his deputy, a young man named Steve Censky, was Acting for a
                    while until the Administration changed in early '93. Rich Schroeter, who was
                    head of the trade policy side, and still is, was Acting until mid-1994, when Gus
                    Schumacher came in, who had been with the World Bank, and the Secretary of
                    Agriculture for the state of Massachusetts, when Dukakis was governor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Rich Schroeter was a junior officer in Brussels, one of
                        the Assistant Attach�s in the mission in the Common Market while I was

                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Well, he was head of the Fruit and Vegetable Division for a while.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. And then he became Assistant Administrator for
                        International Trade, and then was Acting Administrator for two years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: A little over a year and a half; a long time. This Administration took a
                    long time to get organized, to get people in place. Anyhow, that completes it. A
                    full list of the Administrators (and Directors) is attacked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back a ways. We've discussed the fact that during
                        the Carter Administration, the Administrators and some of the top-level
                        people were brought in from outside. They weren't necessarily non-career.
                        Some came from the Hill. But they weren't FASers. But I understand that when
                        the Republicans won the 1980 election, for the next several years, the
                        Administrators were largely career. Is that correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Well, that's true. Dick Smith took over as Administrator in 1981, and he
                    stayed until he retired in 1985. He was followed by Tom Kay, who was not career,
                    but had been in the previous Republican Administration with FAS as a
                    Congressional Liaison man. In fact, Tom had a great line at the FAS staff
                    meeting when he came back in 1981, also as Congressional Liaison. He said, “As I
                    was saying four years ago, when I was so rudely interrupted...” Tom was almost
                    career by that point, and he had earlier served on the Hill, but was not
                    technically a career officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't he on the Agriculture Committee staff? Or was he
                        Tom Foley's assistant? I can't remember.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Gene Moos was Foley's assistant, who later became Assistant Secretary and
                    still is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anyway, I remember working with Tom Kay when I was with
                        Jaenke Associates.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Dick had held a key position as Assistant for Management and
                    Administrator was there, of course, at a crucial time, when the Foreign Service
                    Act included the Department of Agriculture's overseas staff, and Commerce's as
                    well. This got the agency back all of the privileges of the Foreign Service, and
                    we had the option to become Foreign Service officers, but remained on the FAS
                    payroll and under FAS supervision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All of the Attach�s were not Foreign Service officers,
                        were they? I never did quite understand the procedure.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>WELTON: Yes, they were all offered the opportunity to come into the Foreign
                    Service — to, in effect, be blanketed in. Certainly those that were in the
                    field. There was a bit of a distinction on those that had served overseas and
                    were back here in Washington. Many of them had only served one tour overseas, or
                    had served in only one post, and I've forgotten just what the criteria were, but
                    there was some limit on which ones could be blanketed into the Foreign Service
                    here in Washington. As I recall, Larry Thomasson, when he left the Assistant
                    Administrator's spot, noted that about 80 percent of those who were eligible
                    opted into the Foreign Service at that point, and a few more, I think, came in
                    later. But not all of those that were in Washington were given the option of
                    joining the Foreign Service. All those in the field were. So that was quite a
                    change for the agency, and required, in effect, a dual personnel system, which
                    created some management problems that we hadn't had before. There were also
                    problems with morale, because of the split. Those in the General Service
                    category didn't feel like they had the same opportunities necessarily, that the
                    Foreign Service people did for promotion. The promotion system was different,
                    and of course the requirements for getting in were different as well. They were
                    certainly more rigorous than those for the civil service. We did require an oral
                    examination. Not everybody passed. I was on the board for many of those, and I
                    think in the early years maybe only about two thirds passed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who composed the board?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: We would have, I believe, a panel of two Foreign Service officers from
                    the FAS, and one from State or another foreign service agency, on the panel with
                    us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it was dominated pretty much by the Agricultural
                        members.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Ah, yes, we had the key vote. And I might mention also that Dick Smith
                    had been in the previous administration, or prior to the Carter Administration,
                    he had been, I believe, deputy Administrator for both Attach�s and Management,
                    which was a very powerful position because they were both very large elements of
                    the Foreign Agricultural Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Deputy Administrator, or Assistant?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I think he may have started out as Assistant Administrator for both
                    areas, and then I believe he was later Deputy Administrator to Dave Hume. Under
                    the Carter Administration he reverted to Assistant Administrator for Management.
                    Larry Thomasson came back to be Assistant Administrator for Attach�s. They were
                    both key supporters for the Foreign Service Act.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had heard talk that some people thought that was
                        railroaded through.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I notice that Larry mentioned in his farewell letter to the troops before
                    going back to the field in Canada that we had a big conference in Williamsburg,
                    where all of the top level staff met and had an opportunity to express their
                    views, including all of the Assistant Administrators and all of the Division
                    Directors, many of which were not eligible for the Foreign Service. Larry, in
                    his letter, said that we didn't take a vote because the field staff wasn't at
                    the conference. They were overseas. But we knew that they were for it. I think
                    the real reason they didn't take a vote was that it might have been defeated, by
                    those present.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At least a very high negative vote.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Exactly. I'm not at all sure it would have passed. Anyhow, that was the
                    way that transpired.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you think? You were very heavily involved in all
                        this for years after that. How do you think it worked out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I had kind of mixed emotions. In some ways, it was certainly easier
                    without the dual system. But there were advantages, of course, in the assignment
                    process. We almost felt obligated to appoint some people to overseas positions
                    previously. And we did with some misgivings at times. The entry requirements
                    being more strict, limited that pool., but provided, certainly, adequate numbers
                    to fill the overseas assignments. There were certainly, from a personal
                    standpoint, some benefits, with a little better retirement, and being eligible
                    for retirement at 50 instead of 55. I don't think many officers other than Dick
                    Smith, took advantage of the early retirement option. But it was a plus to have
                    that opportunity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Dick Bell?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Dick had already left by then. He came in about the same time as Dick
                    Smith, and maybe rose even more rapidly in the organization, going from GS-7 to
                    Assistant Secretary in about 15 years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Although he spent a few years as the Deputy Director of
                        the Grain Division.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>WELTON: I believe he was Director or Acting Director for a brief period. Then he
                    went across to the Under secretary's office as his deputy. I believe the title
                    was still Assistant Secretary at that time. He then became Assistant Secretary
                    near the end of the Nixon Administration. Then when the Carter Administration
                    came in, he of course was out of that job. He could have been assigned back
                    overseas, I'm sure, but he had a better offer outside. He left to eventually be
                    the head of the Riceland Foods Cooperative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is he still involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: The last time I heard he was the CEO of Riceland Foods. He's still there.
                    The other thing I wanted to mention was that Tom Kay, having a congressional
                    background, was quite helpful in achieving many of our goals in Congress on farm
                    legislation in 1985 and this led to the export enhancement program (EEP).
                    Earlier it was called targeted export assistance (TEA). But on the flip side,
                    Congress also levied a lot of added responsibility on FAS during those years.
                    Special reports, and different things that we had to do to satisfy their
                    desires, without increasing our staffs or budget very much. Also this was the
                    period that the General Accounting Office became very active in overseeing the
                    FAS operations, both there and abroad. It tied up a lot of time in the Agency,
                    and led to some criticism of the operations. Tom may have made a mistake in
                    taking them on, so to speak, rather than being cooperative, and trying to do
                    everything that they felt was necessary to have changed. I remember his poking
                    fun at them at one of our annual cooperator conferences, where they were in
                    attendance. The cooperators were pleased with that, but I don't think it
                    improved relations, and that may have created some additional problems in later
                    years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We haven't discussed too much the question of the titles
                        of the Attach�s. Were the Attach�s permitted to use the titles — to be given
                        the titles of Counselor, before this went into effect, or was this part of

                </p>
                <p>WELTON: This was part of the Foreign Service Act of 1980, which incorporated USDA
                    and Commerce. It did make it a lot easier to obtain the Counselor rank, even
                    Minister Counselor.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had it been possible ... it hadn't been too long though,
                        had it, before that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Previously, I believe it was the 1979 Act which ...</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OKAY. Because when I retired in 1974, Art Minor, way back,
                        maybe even in the '50s, but at least in the '60s, Art Minor and others had
                        been working very hard on it. They took it to the very top levels on three
                        or four different occasions, and State was always adamantly opposed. They
                        just refused to permit it, and no one was willing to try to force it down
                        their throats.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: As I recall, the 1979 Act, which established the Agricultural Trade
                    offices, also mandated at least 10 Agricultural Counselors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it was really forced down the State Department's
                        throat, legislatively.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Right. Those weren't in place yet by the time the Foreign Service Act
                    took effect, but with the Foreign Service Act we were then able to provide the
                    Counselor rank — and that took considerable doing on selecting which posts where
                    those Counselors would be named, and so forth. So it was always a hassle to try
                    to get an additional Counselor named for a post where we felt they should have
                    Counselor rank, and State perhaps didn't. But the Foreign Service Act certainly
                    made that a lot easier. In fact, it became almost routine that any Class I
                    officer, which was the equivalent to a GS 15, at a Class I, II, or III post,
                    which included just about any post that he had anyway, would include the
                    Counselor rank.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know that for many years when we were trying to get
                        State to grant our more senior people the title of Counselor; at that point
                        we weren't thinking of Minister, but anyway Counselor, we thought that we
                        were very seriously handicapped in our work in many ways. Do you think that
                        it worked out that way, that we did gain considerable benefits from it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Oh, I think so. Certainly having the Counselor rank put us on a more
                    equal footing with the Economic Counselor, in particular. In many posts, as you
                    know, the Agricultural Attach� had to go through the Economic Counselor, and in
                    many cases was tasked by the Economic Counselor to report or contribute to
                    certain economic reports at post, which many of the Attach�s felt took away from
                    their regular agricultural reporting. This was always a bone of contention in
                    some posts. Having the Counselor rank, and even Minister-Counselor rank later
                    for many of the important posts, put them on a more equal footing, and got them
                    included in the senior staff meetings at the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The country team meeting.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>WELTON: Yes, the real country team meetings, whereas they may have only been
                    included in what was called the expanded country team previously. It was
                    certainly helpful, I think, in that regard. We mentioned Dick Bell was one of
                    our Assistant Secretaries, but there were a number of others that also
                    contributed a lot to the FAS mission over the years. When the Eisenhower
                    Administration came in, it was the first time that the Department was organized
                    along functional lines with Assistant Secretaries — an Assistant Secretary
                    responsible for, say, soil conservation and related agencies, and another one
                    for marketing and foreign agriculture. Previously, I believe you mentioned that
                    when Brannan was Secretary in the '50s, why, there was just one Assistant
                    Secretary, or Deputy Secretary at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was one Under Secretary and one Assistant
                        Secretary.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: But some of the large agencies were headed by very powerful individuals,
                    more powerful than the Under Secretary or the Assistant Secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Neither of them had much influence before...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: He was there when the Secretary was gone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that was about it. The agency heads were kings in
                        their own areas, pretty much ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: That was certainly true with the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, which
                    was the policy planning areas for USDA and I'm sure others of a similar
                    stature.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They all had strong constituencies outside, and in the
                        Congress as well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Anyhow, Benson organized it with the Assistant Secretary in charge of
                    certain number of agencies. The first one, I believe, in charge of the Foreign
                    Agricultural Service, was John Davis. I see mention of his name in some of the
                    earlier documents. When I came in, in '56, Earl Butz was Assistant Secretary. Of
                    course, he went on to become Secretary later. And a couple of the others that I
                    think played a key role were Clarence Palmby, whom we both know. He didn't
                    follow Butz, because we had a change of administrations. John Schnittker, I
                    believe, was later Under Secretary under the Freeman in the Kennedy
                    Administrations. I think he was a fairly strong individual as well. And then
                    Palmby came in with the Nixon Administration. He had been head of one of the
                    major cooperator groups, and took a active role certainly, and was very
                    supportive of FAS operations when he was Assistant Secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Schnittker played a pretty direct role in negotiations as
                        well. I remember he came over to Geneva for the final negotiations and the
                        signing of the Kennedy Round in May 1967. He and Ray Ioanes came for the
                        last few days of the negotiations, and they were there for the victory party
                        that Mike Blumenthal for that your agreement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I think Dale Hathaway also took an active role in the negotiations when
                    he was there with the Carter Administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Probably in the Tokyo Round. Mike Blumenthal, with the
                        rank of Ambassador, was the chief negotiator for the Kennedy Round, and
                        later Treasury Secretary.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I guess Hathaway was there for the Tokyo Round, I believe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I believe so.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: And then of course, in the Uruguay Round, Dan Amstutz and Crouder were
                    the Assistant Secretaries for a period. And then Joe O'Mara, who had been in
                    Geneva, came back. He was a FAS career officer, and had served in several posts
                    and had been the Assistant Administrator for Trade Policy under Dick Smith, and
                    Tom Kay as well. He played a key role in the negotiations on the FAS side. Then
                    he came back from Geneva, and went over to the Secretary's Office, and really
                    sort of carried the negotiations, I would say, during the changeover to another
                    Democratic Administration with Clinton in '92. He was one of the few that
                    remained after the transition, and had a leading role and was a Special Advisor
                    to Secretary Espy on international trade. He was really the point man on
                    finishing up the negotiations for Agriculture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was during this period that Rich Schroeter, who had
                        been Deputy Assistant Administrator, and then Assistant Administrator, for
                        International Trade — and then he was Acting Administrator for almost two
                        years. It was very strange. Was it that they just politically had trouble
                        getting a consensus on who would take over?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>WELTON: Yes, I think so. As I recall, there were a number of candidates mentioned
                    for the position. But the eventual winner, Gus Schumacher, didn't surface until
                    at least a year later. It took quite a while just to get the Assistant
                    Secretaries all in place, too, although Gene Moos came in fairly early. A number
                    of those positions were hanging for a couple of years. I'm not sure they are all
                    filled yet, as a matter of fact. It took a long time. Certainly those Assistant
                    Secretaries that I mentioned played a key role in the '50s, '60s, and '70s, both
                    in the interagency framework, and with the trade negotiations with foreign
                    countries as well. Clayton Yuetter was certainly another one in that category,
                    who went on to be the Special Trade Representative, and then came back as
                    Secretary of Agriculture. So he had a leading role in various high-level
                    positions over a considerable span of years. He was Assistant Secretary, I
                    recall, when I was in Spain in 1974. In fact, he came to Spain to personally
                    look me over as to whether I could take on this big assignment in Mexico when
                    they brought Dick Smith back. I was in Spain as Assistant, serving with —
                    actually, a former Assistant Secretary — Clarence Miller, who had been in the
                    USDA during the Benson era. And of course, the Secretaries generally have been
                    very supportive of FAS as well, over the years. They appreciated, I think, the
                    importance of exports to the domestic farm economy, and recognized that there is
                    good press there, if it is done right. I might mention that I had the pleasure
                    of accompanying both Secretary Bergland to the Middle East, and Secretary Block
                    to South America, and back to our old post, Buenos Aires, on that trip. Also, I
                    want to mention one of the fellows who was quite helpful in arranging those
                    Secretaries' trips, was Lou MacElroy, who was a retired Colonel, and had come to
                    FAS in the early '70s. He was our main liaison man in making the arrangements.
                    He took care of the gifts, which was always a bit of a difficult and sensitive
                    operation, and did liaison with the Air Force on the planes. You really go
                    first- class when you travel with the Secretary. It wasn't Air Force One, but
                    Three, Four, and Five aren't bad either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's often the same plane, but they call it Air Force One
                        when the President is on it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: And they have them made up in different ways. It reminds me that I never
                    traveled much on luxury planes, but you see in the movies the way those were
                    fitted out. First Class service in terms of food and drink as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I go back far enough to remember when we all went first
                        class, both on planes and on ships. That lasted until, I guess, when we were
                        in Argentina, in the '60s.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I believe when I went to Argentina we could still go first class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, that's right. But it was in the '60s, while we were
                        there, that they changed the regulations.</hi>

                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>WELTON: It was shortly thereafter, because I don't think I ever got to go first
                    class after that. I know I made a domestic trip in the late '50s, and it was
                    standard procedure, maybe even required, that we go first class in those
                    days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was just routine, anyway.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: As a Grade 5 or Grade 7, it seemed a bit much for me. This was when they
                    rolled out the red carpet on the United flights, as I recall. MacElroy — he was
                    a bit of a character, and had a bit of a temper too. He would certainly stand up
                    for the Secretary, when appropriate, and even when it wasn't appropriate at
                    times. I recall when we landed in Panama. It was just a layover for refueling,
                    but it was going to be a couple of hours. Mrs. Block, when she came down the
                    steps, and was greeted by the military brass, said, “Say, I'd like to see a bit
                    of Panama while I'm here.” And this, of course, kind of threw them into a tizzy,
                    because they hadn't really foreseen that, and certainly didn't think it was
                    reasonable, since we were there such a short time. So the Colonel, or the
                    General, grabbed Mac when he got off the plane, and said, “She wants to see
                    Panama. What are we going to do?” And Mac says, “ Well, you better get your rear
                    in gear, General.” or something to that effect. And he did. But Mac got along
                    really well, generally, with the embassy staffs that were making the
                    arrangements. I was there mainly to brief the Secretary, and making sure the
                    Attach�s were on their p's and q's at all times, and taking care of their
                    wishes. The secretaries generally were good travelers, and didn't get into
                    trouble. But you can't always say that for everyone in the Secretary's party. I
                    remembeone of the Deputies we had that, was a bit of a lady's man. It didn't
                    take him long to seek out the lay of the land, so to speak. And he was sort of
                    famous, or infamous for that. But we didn't have that problem with the
                    Secretary. Although I think there was a story about one of them fraternizing a
                    bit too closely with the French Minister of Agriculture, who was female, I
                    hasten to add. Certainly we didn't have any problems like that with Secretary
                    Benson who later became the head of the Mormon church. I had a different problem
                    with Secretary Benson in Colombia. He would ostentatiously refuse to take coffee
                    from his hosts.</p>
                <p>We're digressing here a little bit, and we've gotten into the modern era. Perhaps
                    we need to go back and pick up on some areas we only touched on before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Following the war, as we've said, we had major relief
                        operations for a number of years. There was a severe shortage of food, and
                        all of the extra supplies that we built up earlier were pretty well depleted
                        for a number of years. But then, at what period of time did these surpluses
                        begin to build up again?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>WELTON: In the early '50s the surpluses became a problem once again, similar to
                    those of the '20s. In fact, the surplus disposal programs basically had their
                    roots in the Depression of the '30s. The Federal Farm Board was established in
                    1929 as an action agency to implement farm programs. That provided funding for
                    outlook services, and also provided funding for the initial Foreign Agricultural
                    Service Division in the BAE, as the Board was interested in increasing foreign
                    sales of agricultural products. The Commodity Credit Corporation was established
                    in 1933, as a legal entity which provided — and still does — the funds to
                    operate the Department's Price Support Program and related programs, including
                    those to assist exports. It can buy and sell surplus agricultural commodities,
                    and also donate food for domestic or international relief agencies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I understand it had very broad authority to do that.
                        Congressmen like Jamie Whitten were always goading Agriculture to use its
                        authority more, to a greater extent.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I think we mentioned before that he would raise that every year at the
                    hearings on the Hill. Ray Ioanes told me that Jamie often accused him of trying
                    to follow the State Department's lead all the time. He said he got so fed up
                    with it that he stood up one day at a hearing and said, Mr. Chairman, I just
                    want you to know that I don't even wear striped shorts, and he kind of dropped
                    his pants there and mooned the committee. I don't know if you call that a
                    harvest moon, or perhaps a half moon. He hastened to add that it was all male in
                    those days, as I'm sure it was. But anyhow, we certainly did hear that from
                    Whitten all the time, that the Department had the authority to buy and sell, and
                    they should be out there selling agricultural commodities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For whatever price they would bring.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Right. CCC also had the authority for food relief donations. I don't
                    think it did much of that abroad before World War II. Of course, the situation
                    shifted quite drastically during the war, and we had a War Food Administration,
                    which was set up in the Department to help allocate scarce food resources at
                    that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that under the authority of the Secretary of
                        Agriculture, or was that a separate agency?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>WELTON: No, it was in the Department, but the Administrator of the War Food
                    Administration, reported directly to the White House. But I gather from some of
                    the things Art Minor wrote, and some of the others I have talked with, they
                    worked very well together, so there wasn't as much friction as there might have
                    been in that kind of setting. I'm sure there were disagreements at times. In
                    fact, I believe it was Miner who mentioned that one of the top officials of the
                    War Food Administration said the USA would have a tremendous surplus of food
                    after the war and wouldn't know where to put it. But others argued that there
                    were still a lot of hungry people out there. And of course, there were. Even
                    during the war we had the Lend-Lease activity to the former Soviet Union, which
                    was quite substantial, I'm sure. The Attach�s at the time were quite heavily
                    involved in supplying information on food supply and needs around the world
                    wherever they were located. I mentioned, getting back to the relief programs,
                    and the subsidy programs — they were different, but came along about the same
                    time. In 1935, there was Section 32 of PL-74-320 was enacted, which earmarked a
                    certain amount of all customs receipts to be used for export subsidies. So that
                    was the basis for some of the subsidy programs utilized after the war, in
                    fact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This became a bone of contention in subsequent trade
                        negotiations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Yes, I'm sure. Our subsidy programs always draw a lot of fire from other
                    competitors around the world, and is probably always the number one issue when
                    the Secretary or President meets with the Australians, certainly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Our position is that in most instances it's the pot
                        calling the kettle black. Particularly when the EC complains, or the
                        Japanese.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Later, Public Law 480 came along in 1954, which provided a lot more
                    funding and set up the program which has been in effect to this date, State was
                    always concerned, certainly in the early years, with whether this would displace
                    normal supplies from other nations around the world. In fact, one of the things
                    the Attach� had to do was to get certification that the importers would purchase
                    from their normal suppliers as well. There was frequently a bit of contention
                    between the agencies in getting that assurance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1960-61, I was Executive Secretary of the Trade Staff
                        Committee, I believe it was called— an interagency committee which developed
                        the PL 480 agreements. Of course, that was always a major item of
                        controversy, particularly with the State Department and some of the other
                        agencies. Would these sales replace commercial sales, or on the other hand,
                        would they adversely affect agricultural production in the recipient
                        countries, in effect, to make them more dependent on foreign aid, rather
                        than less? Both of those were heatedly argued. And of course, there was a
                        lot to be said on both sides.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>WELTON: I didn't have much experience in the field with PL 480. Argentina, of
                    course, was not a recipient. They were one of the competitors that we were
                    dealing with. However we also covered Paraguay, and the economic chief there — I
                    think he told you, didn't he, that he would never do another PL 480 program for
                    less that $20 million. The headaches were just too much to make it worthwhile.
                    The only direct experience I had was in El Salvador. They had one of the first
                    private credit programs, and they were supposed to be the first ones to pay off
                    this particular agreement amount. But the Salvadoran agency that normally made
                    those payments — they had a budget cut, and somehow became involved in an
                    interagency struggle there to see who would make the payment. It got delayed and
                    delayed, and finally after considerable effort, we got this last payment. But by
                    that time, there was another few dollars of interest involved, and I told the
                    agency I would be happy to pay it, if they really insisted, but that I didn't
                    want to go back to collect those few dollars. I think they agreed to let that
                    pass. Considering what they wrote off in later years for India, which was way up
                    in the billion dollar or more range, it was small potatoes. It would be an
                    interesting study for someone to go back to see how many of those we did collect
                    in full.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the interesting things, a little bit different, was
                        when we took over properties in Lebanon, for default of payments. Bill
                        Horbaly was the Attach� and he was appointed to the Board of Directors of
                        the leading bank in Beirut.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: We inherited some interesting assets, including a night club and
                    casino.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm not sure how that happened.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: They'll have to interview Bill to get the complete story on that one. I'm
                    sure there are a lot of stories like that involving the PL 480 program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At least tens of millions of dollars were involved in that
                        one. It was a very large sum.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: It would have probably been in that area. I doubt if it was more than
                    $100 million, but it might have been.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>One additional piece of legislation which was important in this whole area was
                    Section 416 of the Agricultural Act of 1949, which provided authority for the
                    donation of commodities by the CCC to people overseas. This remains in effect
                    today as well. Certainly by the mid-'50s, after the Marshall Plan and the German
                    Program that many of the founding fathers of the FAS were involved in, the
                    Surplus Disposal Programs, had became an important part of the FAS activity
                    after 1954. I saw somewhere that between 1955 and 1969 concessional sales
                    accounted for between 20 and 40 percent of all U.S. farm product exports. It's a
                    much lower figure today, but it's still fairly substantial, and certainly an
                    important part of our operations in many of the developing countries in the
                    world. In the old days, a lot of countries were recipients which we wouldn't
                    even think of today for concessional sales — Japan was a participant, and many
                    of the European countries. And certainly Korea and Taiwan later were recipients.
                    Egypt — it's interesting, Egypt is no longer a participant, because they
                    discovered that with — and here's where the two programs come together — with
                    the subsidy program, you can't use the EEP subsidy program with the PL 480
                    program. So you have to pay the going price, so to speak, for the PL 480
                    commodities. So they found it a better fit to buy under EEP and get the cheaper
                    price, and then use the Credit Guarantee Program to finance it. They've been
                    doing that for a couple of years. Anyhow, that about wraps it up on the export
                    programs. We may want to add a bit later, when we review this.</p>
                <p>I think that wraps up the early history of the Foreign Agricultural Service.
                    We'll pick up now with the new FAS in 1954.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As I understand it, there were some major changes that
                        came about as a result of the Agricultural Act of 1954, the transfer of the
                        Agricultural Attach�s from the State Department to USDA. What were some of
                        those changes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: It became a much larger organization. I might mention that we have the
                    list of Attach�s that transferred to the new FAS at that time, which included a
                    lot of the Attach�s who were to play a key role in the Service during the next
                    10 or 20 years, like yourself, Horace Davis, Assistant Administrator for the
                    Attach�s in Washington, who also served in Russia and India, two of our more
                    important posts during those years. Chester Davis, who was in Cuba for many
                    years. In fact, he was there when we got kicked out of Cuba. And others, such as
                    Joe Dodson, Eric Englund didn't stay around too long— he was already a very
                    senior official in London at the time of the transfer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bob Tetro?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>WELTON: Bob Tetro, John Montel, Paul Minneman, who I mentioned had joined the
                    earlier FAS as an Assistant in the 1930's, and then after coming back to FAS in
                    '54 was our Attach� in both Paris and Bonn for a number of years. Bill Rodman,
                    who was a fairly young officer at the time, was in Argentina and then served in
                    a number of posts overseas. Bill was one of our — I don't know if I mentioned
                    this before — we sometimes called the attach�s yard dogs or house dogs. Bill was
                    one of the yard dogs, who spent most of his career in the field. The house dogs
                    would only serve in one or two posts abroad, and served most of their career in
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had 18 years overseas altogether, and 10 years in
                        Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Mine was just about the reverse. I also noted on this list some of those
                    that didn't opt to join FAS, but stayed with State and went on to become
                    Ambassador. In that category we have Clarence Boonstra, and Phil Habib.
                    Ambassador Habib, I remember, wrote one of the more amusing reports I ever saw.
                    They were having an exhibit in Seoul, Korea, when he was ambassador there. The
                    idea was to promote rabbits as a source of meat for the domestic population, so
                    that they could reserve the scarce beef supplies for the hotel and restaurant
                    trade. So they had this exhibit set up in this hotel. The Ambassador noted that
                    the rabbits were doing what rabbits do naturally and attracting quite a crowd.
                    He remarked to the Korean that was showing him through the exhibit, that it
                    might have been better to select the rabbits all of one sex for the exhibit. And
                    the Korean said, Oh, you can tell the difference, Mr. Ambassador? He said, No,
                    but it's obvious you have a mixture here. I always enjoyed that one.</p>
                <p>But to get back to our list of those that became Ambassadors. There were a couple
                    of others as well, that I may have mentioned earlier, that had served as
                    Agricultural Attach�s earlier in their career, including George Vest. He was not
                    on this list. I guess he was not serving in an Agricultural capacity at that
                    time. There is also on this list, one which I found quite interesting. Dick
                    Schwartz, who I found out had served overseas in the inter-war years. In fact,
                    he was a steno-clerk for the war relief mission in London in 1919. He was born
                    in London, so I think he joined as a local employee at the age of 18. Probably
                    our first example of upward mobilization. Later, he became an Assistant Attach�
                    and then an Attach�, serving after World War II in several posts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Another one of those officers, Howard Cottam became an
                        Ambassador in Kuwait, and then a professor after he retired, at American
                        University. I took a course from him, in 1975. He was also head of the of
                        the FAO office in Washington a bit later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I found this was a very interesting list. It also gives their ranks and
                    salary in those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Francis Flood was both an Attach� and Acting Director but
                        stayed with State Department. He was serving as Consul General at a Scottish
                        post, when he was stricken with cancer in 1956 and died a few months
                        later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Yes, that's right. And John Haggerty is also on this list. He was also
                    Director for a brief period. In fact, I don't know if I've told the story about
                    Haggerty. When he left FAS, well actually, I think he went to the field. He was
                    Director when the Administration changed, and he was called over to see the
                    Under Secretary. They had just established an intercom system in the Secretary's
                    office, and they didn't have all the bugs worked out. They didn't realize it was
                    on in the outer office. So Haggerty heard True Morse say to the Secretary,
                    Haggerty's outside, what do I do with him? And Secretary Benson said, “Well,
                    fire him.” So he learned about it a little sooner than he maybe wanted to.</p>
                <p>This infusion of new blood, plus a number that were recruited from within the
                    Department and outside the agency in 1954 and 1955 led to a considerable
                    expansion of FAS, and a substantial change in the organization of the agency. It
                    was pretty well established, along lines that exist today, by the middle of
                    1954. We had an Administrator, a Deputy, and several Assistant Administrators
                    for market development and commodity programs, management, etc.. We didn't have
                    an Assistant Administrator for Attach�s per se at that time, but that developed
                    later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When I came back from Colombia, in 1955, it had been
                        organized by then. Bob Tetro came back from Buenos Aires, to be Assistant
                        Administrator for Attach�s, and Gerry Tichneor was his deputy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: And I believe there was an Assistant Administrator for Trade Policy. That
                    was probably also a bit later. In 1954 Foreign Service and Trade Programs were
                    all kind of lumped together. We had separate breakouts later for the PL 480
                    programs and trade policy, and the attach� service. Dick De Felice came in a bit
                    later...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From the General Counsel's Office.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: He actually came to FAS in 1954 under Dick Roberts in the Trade Programs
                    Division, and Ioanes was Roberts' assistant at that time, before he moved into
                    the Assistant to the Administrator position in the Front Office. Then De Felice
                    took over trade policy, and I think was there just about as long as Ioanes was.
                    Ioanes left in 1974.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think Dick actually retired — he was just about the same
                        year.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: He was still there when I left for Spain in 1973.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ioanes retired in late 1973, I retired in June 1974, and
                        Dick. I'm not quite sure when he retired, but he was under contract for a
                        while, working on the Tokyo Round, I believe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Yes, I suspect he was. So he was involved for quite a number of years.
                    Part of the time that I was there, Howard Worthington was the Associate
                    Administrator, a very effective man involved in trade policy for a number of
                    years, in a number of different agencies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I replaced him as Deputy Assistant Administrator in 1968,
                        when he went to State as head of the Office of International Trade.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: And then he went to Treasury.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then he went to Treasury as Deputy Assistant Secretary
                        about 1974. Actually, first he came back to FAS as Associate Administrator
                        in 1970.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I thought he went to Treasury first, and then came back. I thought he
                    died as Associate Administrator.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, he was at Treasury, when he died in March of 1975. I
                        had recently retired and had just joined Jaenke Associates and I went to his
                        funeral.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I may have that reversed. Howard was very effective at interagency
                    meetings that I attended with him. I always remember one expression he used: A
                    good negotiator should remain calm but abusive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He really believed that, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I'm not sure he always remained calm, but ...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He didn't always remain calm, nor was he always

                </p>
                <p>WELTON: He was one of the relative few that we had that practiced the policy of
                    changing agencies about every 5 years or so, and moved up the ladder very well
                    in doing so.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember he was at Treasury, because on the day he died,
                        he was scheduled the next day to go to Geneva to an important trade
                        negotiation. The Treasury Assistant Secretary, his boss, said the next day
                        that Howard was a key player in the trade negotiations, and what a loss it
                        was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: He died very young.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was 46, I believe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: That organization chart in the mid 1950's established the basic structure
                    of FAS, which still operates today. Getting back to the Attach� Service, which
                    I'm most familiar with, at the same time, or certainly by the time I came in in
                    1956, they established the Area Officer arrangement with a group of about four
                    or five area officers for the different regions of the world. This provided a
                    lot more supervision and guidance for the Attach�s abroad from Washington. I
                    remember Horace Davis mentioned that in the early years, before World War II,
                    the Attach�s were very few in number. He said they operated pretty much as stray
                    cats overseas. There was not a whole lot of direction or guidance from
                    Washington other than I'm sure that they had reporting requirements. Other
                    things were kind of assigned as they went out. But not a whole lot of contact,
                    and certainly visits were limited in those days. By the 1970's we tried to have
                    either the Area Officer or the Assistant or Deputy Administrator visit each post
                    about once a year. We kept to that schedule pretty much while I was there, and I
                    think they still do. Also, the Attach� Conferences were another effective means
                    of communicating with the Attach�s. I don't know when those started, but it
                    certainly was very early; probably late '50s, early '60s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, there was one while I was in Manila in 1959 - A Far
                        Eastern Conference in New Delhi. Oh yes, and a Latin America Conference in
                        Mexico City in 1954, while I was in Bogota.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: There was a worldwide conference during Kennedy's Administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1962, I believe. Yes, it was a worldwide conference. I
                        came up from Buenos Aires.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: And I think there was another one in 1973. I think those were the only
                    two that I'm aware of, until one was held in the summer of 1996. But the
                    regional conferences have been held regularly since the 1950s, generally about
                    once a year.</p>
                <p>Another thing I've noticed on our list of Attach�s in 1954 was that there's been
                    quite a change in the diversity of the organization in recent years. In this
                    list, we had two females. One was Anna Gomez, in Mexico City. She stayed there
                    for many years, as an American resident Assistant Attach�.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was originally hired as a clerk, was she not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: May have been, I'm not sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But she was there for 30-some years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: The other one I don't think stayed with the Agency very long. It was a
                    few years before we had any females actually assigned as Assistants from
                    Washington. There was one named Donna Hersey who went to Caracas in the 1960s.
                    By the time I came back from Mexico in the mid-'70s, we had several overseas,
                    including two who had used upward mobility program and had previously been
                    secretaries overseas. One was Mattie Sharpless, who went on to become Assistant
                    Administrator, just before I left in 1989.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And still is?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: No, she has gone to Paris now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was fairly recently?.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Yes, just last year. And Molly Iler was the first one to achieve the rank
                    of Agricultural Counselor, in Rome. I don't think there were any minorities on
                    the 1954 Attach� list. Well, of course, Anna Gomez was a minority, but I believe
                    the first black Attach� was Garth Thorburn, who was probably on board when I
                    came in, in the mid-1950s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He went to Paris about in 1956 as Assistant. I briefed
                        him, because I'd been to Paris just a few weeks before.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: And then of course there were a number of others that came in later. Just
                    as an indication of the diversity in more recent years, I was intrigued to note
                    last year's postings for overseas assignment, when Mattie went to Paris. There
                    were a total of 21 officers, which included 11 white males, 5 blacks, 1
                    oriental, 1 Latin, 1 from the Middle East, and 2 other females besides Mattie..
                    That was almost 50-50. That was quite a change from even when I came back in
                    1977, when all of the area officers and the Assistant Administrator and Deputy
                    were all white males. We brought in Cline Warren, one of our black officers, to
                    be Area Officer during that period —about 1980. He was very effective in that
                    position.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dick you came into FAS during a rather interesting time,
                        when there was quite a buildup in personnel, and so forth. Why don't you
                        tell us a little bit about your experiences and career in those days.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: My interest in FAS was largely generated by the Deputy Administrator,
                    Clayton Whipple, who was also teaching a night course at Maryland at the time. I
                    came in in 1956, shortly after the Attach�s had switched over in 1954 or 1955.
                    They were bringing in a lot of us fresh out of the university at the time, and
                    of course a lot of other people were being recruited from industry and other
                    areas at the same time. We had many good people, and certainly there was an
                    excellent esprit de corps in FAS in the 19 50s and 1960s. I remember one of my
                    colleagues referring to the Forest Service as the Marine Corps of USDA, and I
                    think in some respects the Foreign Agricultural Service was along the same line,
                    very professional and with high morale. I'm afraid we've lost some of that in
                    more recent years, but I think it's still considered a very strong agency, and
                    an excellent group of people. Of course, when you bring in a big group,
                    sometimes you get a few that perhaps should have been passed over.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>We had some real characters in the livestock division, where I started out. One
                    lady, I recall, sometimes referred to the Cat Lady. She had about 25 cats. But
                    she was a good secretary. She had another interesting characteristic — she
                    talked to the hereafter, i.e. she claimed she could reach those that had passed
                    on. You may remember Grover Sims, an Economist in the Livestock Division, who
                    came to Argentina when we were there. I always felt bad about it, because I'd
                    made a series of appointments, and as frequently happens, you run a little late,
                    because you talk a little longer than you anticipate. I'd be hurrying along for
                    the next meeting, and he would be kind of huffing and puffing, and saying, Could
                    we take it a little slower? And the poor fellow, when he came back, had an open
                    heart operation, and didn't make it, so he died. It was probably one of the
                    early heart operations of that type. But I remember one of his colleagues had
                    the task of taking the deceased Grover's notes .This was Martin Morgan, who, as
                    you know, comes to our retiree lunches. So Martin had to finish up Grover's
                    report. And he mentioned that this secretary, the Cat Lady, was very helpful to
                    him, because she would talk to Grover, and helped fill in certain information as
                    she went along. And there was another statistician, who was almost committable.
                    She was very emotional, and would get very upset when Attach�s would send in
                    reports changing some of her statistics. She liked to have her tables
                    consistent, and didn't like to change all these figures for previous years. And
                    then there was another one, and this was a professional analyst, who told one of
                    his bosses — I don't want to mention his name, we'll just call him Turner — that
                    he'd taken out a hit contract on him. Turner, naturally was a bit upset. I don't
                    think anybody ever took action on the case, but kind of brushed it aside. But
                    Dick Smith was Administrator at the time, and we were having an Attach�
                    Conference in Europe, I believe. He asked Turner which plane he was going on —
                    he said he didn't want to take the same plane. Turner did not see the humor in
                    that one at all. Those were a few of the characters we had there in Livestock.
                    One other name that comes to mind ,not in the same vein, but in the Livestock
                    Division, that I had always thought had found the proper niche in FAS was Claude
                    Dobbins. You recall he came to visit us in Argentina with one of the livestock
                    groups. I've often thought it was useful in the foreign service to have a hook
                    that you can fall back on, and have a special characteristic which people
                    remember you by. Claude had an artificial limb.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He lost his hand during WWII.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: That's true. I remember being on a ranch in Argentina. They had a little
                    girl, about 5 or 6, I guess. She was fascinated that Claude could hold a
                    cocktail with that hook. I think he could hold a pencil and even write a little
                    bit with it as well. Her father asked if Claude would show her how that worked,
                    and he did. I'm not sure he liked to do that too often, but he consented to show
                    her how it operated.</p>
                <p>But we also had some people with unusual talents. One I heard about had been a
                    belly dancer in her college years. I don't know if we still had our nightclub in
                    Beirut at that time, but we could have used her over there.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that when we'd taken over the PL 480 debts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I think we did manage to get rid of that, maybe during Bill Horbaly's
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill was on the Board of Directors, I understand, to

                </p>
                <p>WELTON: And then there was a young man who had posed for some ads in one of the
                    ladies magazines. He's now our Assistant Attach� in Brazil. I'm not sure that
                    was a good choice to send him to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn't an underwear ad, was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I think it was, as a matter of fact.</p>
                <p>One other fellow that we worked with who had an interesting background was Henry
                    XXX, who was our colleague in Montevideo, when we were in Buenos Aires. Henry
                    had run for Congress, and had a lot of friends in high places. I remember Horace
                    Davis was Assistant Administrator for Attach�s when Henry was down there, and
                    came back for home leave, or maybe it was after he retired, I don't know. He
                    thought it was kind of a routine welcome home party, but I think they had
                    several Supreme Court Justices, a number of members of Congress, and other high
                    level Washington officials at this affair. Henry was there for many years, and I
                    don't know that he distinguished himself too much as an Attach�, but he did have
                    an interesting background.Certainly we had some excellent people. Some went on
                    to significant achievements outside the agency. I remember Susie Early was one
                    of our economists in the Livestock Division. She left FAS and went on to the
                    Trade Representative's Office, and is now the Assistant Trade Representative in
                    charge of Agriculture. And another colleague in trade policy, Don Phillips, also
                    went over there about the same time, and he's now the Assistant Trade
                    Representative for manufactured, industrial products. They both have key
                    positions there. And I'm sure there are others that we could think of.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Didn't Jim Starkey...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I don't know if he had the same position that Susie Early has now?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think he did.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>WELTON: Yes, he worked on the Tokyo Round. In fact, I remember Jim saying that
                    that would be the last major trade negotiation of this century.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then Howard Worthington had been in Commerce, came to
                        FAS, and went to State. He went back to FAS as Associate Administrator, and
                        then to Treasury as Deputy Assistant Secretary. And then of course died
                        tragically of a heart attack when he was still in his 40s.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Yes, I think we mentioned Howard earlier.</p>
                <p>There are a number of staff people that certainly made a strong impression on me
                    in the agency. I know Ray Ioanes paid tribute to the Front Office secretaries,
                    Frances Wolf and Vivian Cole. And I think all of us would certainly second his
                    high regard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Vivian was my secretary for a few years after we came back
                        from Argentina.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: They were almost like housemothers to us, in some ways, looking after us.
                    I remember Frances one time calling me and said, Ioanes wants to talk to you.
                    And I asked, On the phone or come up? or something to that effect. She said,
                    Well, he wants to chew you out. Which way do you prefer?Also, I certainly
                    learned to appreciate the Foreign Visitors Staff during my years in FAS. They
                    took care of arranging programs in the U.S. for our colleagues overseas. Many of
                    them of course wanted to visit certain areas of the States, and they had the
                    contacts with the land-grant universities and the State Departments of
                    Agriculture, to best fill those wishes. And they also of course worked closely
                    with the foreign Attach�s here in Washington in setting up programs for them,
                    when they wanted to go out and visit U.S. agriculture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might mention that one of my first bosses, who was also
                        on my examining board for the Foreign Service, and at that time was the
                        Assistant Director of OFAR when I came in, went on to be Acting
                        Administrator at one time, and then went back to the Foreign Service and was
                        Consul General in Edinburgh — Francis Flood. Francis had had a rather
                        colorful career as a journalist in Oklahoma. He also was a writer. He would
                        take some rather exotic trips. For example, he went across the heart of
                        Africa, the Sahara Desert, with another fellow, who actually wrote the book,
                        called Free Wheeling Through Africa. Then Francis went back and wrote
                        articles about this trip for his magazine, Stockman's Journal, or something
                        like that, in Oklahoma.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: There is a Stockman's Journal for livestock.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He also took a trip through the Indonesian jungles, and
                        wrote about that. He was a very colorful, and very brilliant guy.</hi>

                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>WELTON: We both knew Ford Miles, who I guess really was kind of our first
                    regional Attach� for a lot of Africa. We had people, of course, in the early
                    years, in Egypt and South Africa, but Ford covered the rest, almost. I guess it
                    was really West Africa. But still, he covered a large territory.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lagos?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I believe so. I remember him talking about — this was still when it was
                    under the French — and the French were very helpful to him in making
                    arrangements and really trying to keep track of him on his travels, and alerting
                    the next post on the way that he was coming through.</p>
                <p>I should also pay special tribute to one other one I wanted to mention on the
                    staff level, who was very helpful over the years. Ed Cornick, in our
                    publications office, just had a very pleasant personality, and would always go
                    the extra mile in digging out anything you wanted to know about U.S.
                    agriculture, and certainly any FAS publications. He was most helpful, and was
                    there for many years. I also wanted to pay special tribute to our secretaries in
                    the Attach� office here in Washington, Ruth Mihalic, and Peggy Jacobs, who
                    worked closely with me during the last 10 years or so that I was working in
                    Washington. They kept me out of trouble — a lot. I sometimes regretted that I
                    never got back into commodity work. I enjoyed working in commodity analysis, but
                    they and the area officers were certainly great people to work with in FAS, and
                    were quite helpful to me over the years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dick, you had some interesting posts in your career. Can
                        you tell us a little bit about them, and what were some of your experiences
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>WELTON: Well, we've talked quite a bit about Argentina, since we were both there.
                    Certainly it was in some ways the most fascinating post to work in. I probably
                    got to travel more than just about any post that I served in, probably because I
                    was there the longest. And there were a lot of similarities to U.S. agriculture,
                    and a lot of differences too. But it was a fascinating place to be at that time.
                    You mentioned all of the revolutions that we had. One of the more unique
                    experiences and perhaps one of the more harrowing experiences there was when we
                    had our car commandeered in Cordoba, I believe. The policeman flagged me down
                    and he said, Follow that boy on a motorcycle — he's stolen some cars. So I
                    didn't argue. He jumped in the back seat. Helen was with me. He rolled down the
                    window and stuck his pistol out one side. Then he'd slide across and stick it
                    out the other side. He was kind of weaving in and out of traffic. He turned down
                    kind of a dirt lane, so I had to follow him over some pretty rough terrain.
                    Helen was kind of curled up on the seat, panicked. Then he turned into what
                    looked like a warehouse. I always remember the policeman, after trying to shoot
                    this guy. He gets out of the car and says, Senor... He was very polite, asked
                    him to stop and apprehended him. I don't know how at that point he got him back,
                    but I'd done my job.</p>
                <p>The next post was El Salvador, which was almost an opposite extreme, in that it's
                    a very small country, and we also covered Nicaragua, so I traveled down there.
                    At that time I was going down about once a quarter. I found quarterly visits
                    were about all I needed to do in connection with the reporting schedule. I
                    sometimes felt that some of my best contacts were in Nicaragua, because we would
                    go down for most of the week, in a very concentrated visit. I'd call people for
                    breakfast appointments, so I'd make the rounds and try to make sure I'd see
                    everybody. It was an interesting time. Fortunately it was before a lot of the
                    troubles that broke out in El Salvador and Nicaragua. I could see it coming in
                    Nicaragua, but in El Salvador things seemed to be fairly tightly controlled.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was probably one of the problems — too tightly
                        controlled.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Probably so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The elite pretty well controlled things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Certainly there was quite a disparity between the so-called fortune
                    families and the rest of the people. They did have a fairly sizeable middle
                    class there too. But Nicaragua had more of a dictatorship and you could
                    certainly see it coming there.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>And then Spain was a short tour. The family didn't really enjoy it very much
                    there. It was interesting in many respects, but some key differences, perhaps,
                    worth noting was that being a cosmopolitan city, Madrid, there wasn't a very
                    strong embassy wives' group, and everybody sort of did their own thing. I
                    thought Helen really missed that. I said early in my career that I knew of two
                    American wives that really enjoyed the foreign service — Helen wasn't one of
                    those, but she went along with it pretty well, and was a good sport and good
                    host on most occasions. I probably pushed it a bit when I took some of our
                    cattlemen in to see her in the bedroom when she was suffering from a
                    particularly bad case of Montezuma's Revenge. I was in the process of showing
                    them around the house. I thought I should at least introduce them, but she would
                    have just as soon I'd passed on.</p>
                <p>And then of course it was a different experience. I had been Attach� in El
                    Salvador, and then I went to Spain as the Assistant Attach�. The Attach� was
                    Clarence Miller, who had been an Assistant Secretary years earlier, in the
                    Eisenhower Administration. Clarence had not had experience before that as an
                    Attach�, so we had to take care of a lot of things in supporting Clarence.
                    Clarence was very good with visitors and in the market promotion side, as well.
                    I think probably the most rewarding post in many ways was Mexico. I was there
                    also a fairly short time — only two and a half years — but I have asthma, so
                    that was a drawback there. But we had a lot of programs going on. Lots of
                    visitors, including Secretary Butz, who came there shortly after his ill-fated
                    trip, when he told the joke that got him in trouble. But he was a great
                    visitor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He visited us in Brussels, and met the top officials in
                        the Ministry of Agriculture. He was very capable and very helpful to

                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>WELTON: I thought one of the best Ambassadors I had was John Jova in Mexico. He
                    probably took more interest in his American staff''s welfare than any other
                    ambassador I've served under. He tried to get to know the staff. Secretary Butz
                    made a compliment — I asked that Butz meet with him and the larger embassy
                    staff, and there must have been fifty people there. And the Ambassador went
                    around and introduced them all by name. Secretary Butz said, Mr. Ambassador,
                    that was an amazing performance. You may have stumbled over one name or two, but
                    you have gotten to know all the people. Actually, I think all of the Ambassadors
                    that I had were fairly easy to work with. Probably the most eccentric person I
                    had was Ambassador McClintock in Argentina. He had a dog that went everywhere
                    with him, and he had a monthly visit to the staff, when he would come around to
                    the Attach�'s office every month. I remember somebody commented once that he
                    came in and we had a big dictionary on a stand, and he said, You don't use this
                    dictionary much, do you? He'd noticed that it was opened to the same page it had
                    been the month before. As I say, they were all fairly easy to work with. Some of
                    the wives, on the other hand, were a bit more difficult. I remember the DCM's
                    wife in Mexico, and we had an Ambassador's wife who had been a sheriff. She was
                    kind of difficult to live with at times. Kind of the epitome of the Ugly
                    American. I won't mention that name, of course. But those were some of my more
                    memorable experiences. One I might mention in El Salvador. It was one of the
                    advantages of a small post was that you get to know the Minister of Agriculture
                    and other high level officials better than at some of the larger posts, where
                    you may not have access to the Minister, except on rather rare occasions. We had
                    one of the U.S. cattlemen.</p>
                <p>This fellow, the Alabama cattleman — I think he was Secretary of the Red Angus
                    Association. He decided as a goodwill gesture that he would donate a bull to
                    individual countries. I think he did that for most of Central America, and maybe
                    even Colombia and Venezuela in South America. So they sent the bull down and I
                    went out to receive him, and turned him over the Ministry of Agriculture. And
                    then he came down a few months later to see how the bull was doing. So we
                    arranged to visit with the bull and the Ministry of Agriculture people. He also
                    requested a meeting with the President. Surprisingly, this was granted, and he
                    said, Well, I now know where I can get my other box of pecans. I was a little
                    nervous about taking this box into the President's office. So I said that there
                    may be some security concerns about bringing this in. He said, Well, I gave one
                    to President Kennedy. So I said that I thought we could do it here, and there
                    was no problem. I accompanied him to see the President, and I was surprised the
                    President invited us both in, just the three of us, so I had to serve as a
                    translator for him. But he got along okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Colombia, one of our visitors presented a prize bull to
                        the President of Colombia. And very shortly thereafter the bull got sick.
                        They sent a veterinarian up from the States to try to save it. I don't know
                        what the problem was, but the bull died a horrible death.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>WELTON: That was one of my fears with this one, because I remember when it came
                    into the airport, they came out to get him with a very small panel truck. And I
                    had visions of this bull jumping out of the truck and breaking its neck on his
                    way into San Salvador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And breaking somebody else's neck at the same time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: But at least he survived until Joe's visit was completed. I don't know
                    how many years after that, but as I said, I wasn't there very long. That was my
                    experience in El Salvador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any other interesting visitors?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Secretary Butz was one of the more interesting visitors. We had a lot of
                    visitors in Mexico. One of the groups that came around that was kind of
                    interesting was the Houston Livestock Show. I don't know if they organized that
                    before or when you were in Colombia. But they would certainly come around
                    Central America and northern South America, promoting their show, to encourage
                    visitors from those countries. They had a special Latin American visitor's
                    lounge for that, in Houston. In fact, I went up the show myself when I lived in
                    El Salvador. I tried to lay on a usual program for them, but I think they had
                    been playing pinochle all around Latin America, so really all they wanted to do
                    was sit around the hotel pool and play pinochle, and host the reception.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They came to Colombia while I was there. I got some sort
                        of certificate from their Board for helping out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Somebody told me they still tell this story in FAS, that I went out to
                    the airport to see them off, and one of them said, You didn't have to do this.
                    And I said, Well, I wanted to make sure you all got on the plane.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Argentina while I was back in the States at
                        the time for a conference or something, when Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr.
                        brought a group — he as a shorthorn?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Maybe that was before you arrived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess it was just before I arrived.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>WELTON: I remember we have pictures; John, our son, was just about two and a half
                    months old. They arranged a very nice 'asado,' a picnic, for FDR, Jr., and a
                    fellow from Maryland who was with the Hereford Association. And then the
                    Secretary of the Association. That was quite a nice introduction to the Pampas
                    of Argentina.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I benefited from the fallout of that, because
                        Franklin Jr. later on, when we had the World Attach� conference in
                        Washington, in 1962 — he arranged with the White House to have a reception
                        for the Attach�s from Latin America. They invited all of the Attach�s to the
                        White House, but Franklin Roosevelt took the Latin American attach�s all out
                        to lunch, and took them to the White House and introduced them to the
                        President, who spoke to the whole group.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I knew that the whole group had gone there, but I'd never heard that
                    story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then, he took us out to the ranch of this Maryland
                        breeder that you are talking about.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: Royer was his name.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A beautiful place. We had an all-day picnic there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: It wasn't very far, was it?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, it isn't very far out in the country. That was a very
                        interesting day.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: He was probably one of our more famous visitors. And I'm sure there are
                    other that I might think of later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the opportunity to get back to some of your
                        old posts since you left, Dick?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>WELTON: Yes, I had opportunities to visit them all, as Deputy Assistant
                    Administrator for the Attach� Service. We and the area officers tried to visit
                    each post just about every year. One time I counted up that I had been in 55
                    countries, all told, including my attach� days. But I got back to visit them
                    all. I got back to Argentina twice. The first time was in the early '80s, on a
                    regular supervisory visit. And then it was about 1985, that I went back with
                    Secretary Block, in his group, on a tour of South America. It was particularly
                    enjoyable, especially the first time, after 20 years, to get back there to visit
                    some of the old haunts. I stayed in the Sheraton Hotel, which is down near the
                    Retiro train station, right across the plaza, and down the bottom of the hill,
                    near the court also. I got to go back to the Italian area, the Boca, and walked
                    down Florida. Some of the restaurants are still there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's still a pedestrian area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I believe so. There's a new super highway to the airport, that goes
                    through town, so that you don't have to got clear around town, the way we used
                    to. And of course, I got to see a few of the people that were still around.
                    Edna, of course, is still there, as one of the assistants.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bob Tetro hired her back in the mid-'50s, a good 40
                        years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WELTON: I think she worked for the Military Attach� in the embassy.</p>
                <p>In Spain I just had one very brief visit, just overnight, when I went with
                    Secretary Bergman and his party to the Middle East. So I don't think I ever got
                    back there either as area officer or on a post supervisory visit. I got to see
                    some of the staff, but that was about it.</p>
                <p>I think I visited El Salvador twice; once just before I retired in '89, and once
                    with Secretary Block on the way to Buenos Aires. I think we stopped in El
                    Salvador and Guatemala — I think it was a 4-hour visit. They wanted to get him
                    out of there pretty quickly. Actually, we were there on a holiday, so it was
                    fairly calm, a good time to visit. The second time I was there there was a bomb
                    scare, and they sent everybody home in the early afternoon.</p>
                <p>I don't believe I got to visit Mexico on a supervisory visit. We went back as
                    tourists a couple of years ago, after I retired, to visit the office there.
                    Spent a week in Acapulco, and got familiar with that part of the country. I
                    don't think there were a whole lot of changes in Mexico City, although I thought
                    the traffic moved a little better. They've had to make some changes in that way,
                    to make some of the streets one way. They have cracked down on trying to control
                    some of the pollution problems. You can only drive even-numbered license plates
                    on one day, and odd-numbered on the other. I guess a lot more people have two
                    cars now, which may have defeated the purpose.</p>
