                <p>AMBASSADOR THOMAS F. STROOCK</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Andrew Low </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: November 27, 1993</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>This is an interview of Ambassador Thomas F. Stroock, conducted on November 27th,
                    1993 in Denver, Colorado. The interviewee, Thomas F. Stroock is from Casper,
                    Wyoming, is the former ambassador to Guatemala. The interviewer is Andrew Low,
                    his son-in-law.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay . . . Ambassador Stroock (chuckles) , Dad-in-law, I'd
                        like you to start by giving a little of your background, first your business
                        background and then your involvement with Wyoming politics.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: Well, after I graduated from Yale University back when the Earth was
                    cooling in 1948, I was hired by the Stanolind Oil and Gas Company, now the Amoco
                    Production Company, the producing subsidiary of Standard Oil Company of Indiana.
                    To go to work for them my first assignment was to be an interpreter in the
                    country of Colombia because I spoke Spanish, had taught school for two summers
                    in Havana, and had married a Cuban girl. To get me to go down there of course
                    they had to teach me the oil business because the idea was that I was to
                    interpret for their seismic crews down there. So they put me on a six month
                    training program that carried me throughout the west. First on seismic crews,
                    and then doing some work in the main office in Tulsa, and then on a drilling rig
                    out on the Four Corners of the west where Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado and Utah
                    come together. I was there when they had a revolution in Colombia, the famous
                    Bogotazo of '48?, and there were several shots fired at the Stanolind Offices in
                    Bogota and the decision was made to bring the whole company home and to close
                    down their operations in Colombia. So the man who had hired me, George
                    Jenkinson, who was a Yale graduate and had hired me off the campus at Yale,
                    called me and told me there was no job offer. And of course I sounded a little
                    desperate, and I was a little desperate, I had become engaged to be married and
                    committed myself to that on the basis of a job I was going to have there. They
                    were going to pay me all of $298 a month, which was a princely sum in those
                    days. So he called me back to Tulsa and interviewed me and he said, “There's a
                    job in Albuquerque, New Mexico with the company land office there. Will you go
                    to Albuquerque?” and I said, “You better believe I will.” And I went there and
                    then the job moved to Casper, Wyoming, and so I moved to Casper in 1948 and
                    started out in the oil and gas business there.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did you stay with Stanolind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: I was with them until January 1, 1952 when I started my own oil business
                    mostly because they wanted to move me out of Wyoming and I didn't want to move.
                    By that time we'd fallen in love with the place and I started out brokering oil
                    and gas leases and then taking pieces of oil and gas lease deals myself and we
                    gradually built up to be one of the more important independent operations in the
                    state of Wyoming.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you still in the oil business when you were appointed
                        ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: Oh yes, I've always been in the oil business, but like anything else,
                    you know, I guess it was the training I got at Yale, I've always been interested
                    in civic and political affairs. I've always been reasonably conservative in my
                    political views, and I stared to get interested in civic affairs: the United
                    Fund, chairmanships and community recreation chairmanships and ended up running
                    for the School Board back in 1960, and actually getting elected. A group of
                    young people wanted to make sure that their children got foreign language
                    education, which wasn't offered at the time. The true story about that is that a
                    group at a cocktail party decided that one of us should run and I left town for
                    a week to go to North Dakota on an oil and gas lease deal, and when I got back
                    one of the people at the party, a young architect by the name of Bob Wehrle had
                    circulated a nominating petition, gotten 25 names on it, gotten everybody to put
                    up a dollar for the 25 dollar filing fee, and had it ready for me to sign when I
                    got home. So I signed, became a candidate, and got elected to the School Board.
                    And of course one thing leads to another in a small state like Wyoming with less
                    than half a million people. When you're on the School Board then you get
                    involved in lobbying the legislature for school finances. That doesn't turn out
                    the way you think it should, so you end up running for the State School Board. I
                    became chairman of that. Then I was angry about the way the legislature had not
                    established a School Foundation Fund as they had promised to do. The Speaker of
                    the House, a man by the name of Joe Budd, personally told me, “Tom, I'll make
                    sure that that Foundation Fund bill passes.” That's what he said to me, but to
                    his colleagues he said, “Don't worry about it, it'll never happen,” and he never
                    brought it up. So the bill died, and—very angry about that—I determined to run
                    for the legislature, precisely to do something about the School Foundation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which year did you first run for the legislature?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>STROOCK: It was in 1967 that I ran for the State Senate. That year the Senator
                    who represented our county died, Bob Murphy, so instead of running for the State
                    Legislature, I decided to run for the State Senate. There are only 30 state
                    senators. I figured you had twice as much influence as the 64 House members. I
                    ran and got elected, and did serve on the Education Committee, and we did change
                    the Foundation Fund. One thing led to another and I ended up being Republican
                    State Chairman and Chairman of the Joint Appropriations Committee and Vice
                    President of the Senate. I was really very much involved in Republican national
                    affairs when I was Wyoming Republican State Chairman. I was elected Chairman of
                    the Western States Republican Organization and in that capacity was very much
                    interested in promoting the candidacy of a college friend of mine, George Bush,
                    to be President of the United States. “Poppy” as I knew him (it was much easier
                    to call him Mr. President than George). Poppy was the name that we gave him in
                    school. He was an obvious leader on campus and was obviously going to go
                    someplace. There was the interesting coincidence that he left the campus to go
                    into the oil business too, but in Texas, and professionally or business-wise we
                    never touched clubs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was President Bush, later to be President Bush, then
                        George Bush, was he the same year at Yale as you were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: Yes, he and I were classmates and I was a substitute for one year on the
                    baseball team where he was the captain. We took a couple of classes together,
                    and we were friends. I always admired him, and I remember when his political
                    career started, and he was going to run for the United States Senate, from
                    Texas. I went down to a meeting in Dallas. A whole bunch of Yale classmates and
                    friends who were interested in promoting his candidacy were there. Barbara Bush
                    told us that no candidate from Texas would ever be known as “Poppy” and we had
                    to quit calling him that and call him “George.” That was very difficult to do,
                    it was much easier to call him Mr. Vice President or Mr. President. In any
                    event, I got involved early on in Bush's political activities. When he was the
                    National Chairman, I was the State Chairman and I brought him out to Wyoming to
                    address the State Convention. I had an airplane at that time and we flew all
                    around the Western States. We made two tours of the Western States while he was
                    the Republican chairman. It was a way of promoting his future candidacy, and
                    when he ran his first campaign...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say he was being stationed in the National Chair?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: National Chair of the Republican party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>STROOCK: I was Republican State Chairman. When the campaign got started in
                    earnest in 1976? was when we did all this kind of activity. Then in 1980 was
                    when he really made a run at it. Ronald Reagan was far and away in the lead and
                    George was constantly playing catch up, particularly in the West. It was no easy
                    thing to be a Bush supporter and delegate in the West because the Reaganites
                    were really tough. While Ronald Reagan was not at all a vicious person, truly a
                    very kind man—his political supporters politically were very vicious and played
                    very tough. They threw at your head and it cost a lot to take after the
                    Reaganites. I started in Wyoming and built the Wyoming Organization and then
                    with Ken Neal up in Montana built the Montana Organization came down to Denver
                    with the Gates family and Wally Forbes' wife and we worked on the Colorado. I
                    ended up being in charge of the Rocky Mountain Region reporting to Jim Baker,
                    who was then running the campaign. We came close and when Poppy Bush became Vice
                    President we stayed in contact. Once I represented him, I think that had to be
                    about 1983 or '84 at a big ceremony in Spain honoring the 200th anniversary
                    birth of Father Junipero Serra who started the California missions. And I was
                    called back to Washington. There was a time there when they were talking to me
                    about becoming Deputy Commissioner of Indian Affairs—which was no job I wanted.
                    I didn't want to live in Washington and I sure didn't want to be in Indian
                    Affairs. I stayed in touch with the Vice President and he with me, and then in
                    1984 I was as active as one could be. The Reaganites of course took the lead
                    politically in the 1984 reelection campaign. Then in '88 I did the same thing
                    for the Bush presidential campaign I had done in 1980, except this time we were
                    obviously king dog on top of the hill and we had a much easier time of it. For a
                    whole series of reasons George Bush got elected President of the United States,
                    and when he became President begins the tale of how I got to be ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's stop there for just a second. You had mentioned that
                        by this time you spoke Spanish?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: Yes, I had spoken Spanish since I'd graduated from college. I took
                    intensive Spanish at college and I taught English and American History for two
                    summers at a school called Ruston Academy in Havana, Cuba and while I was down
                    there doing that I met your mother-in-law, my wife Marta.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And so as a result you've had the opportunity of speaking
                        Spanish all these years and kept it polished up.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>STROOCK: Not really. I used Spanish whenever I spoke to Hispanics. There's a
                    large Spanish speaking population in the Rocky Mountain states. I would
                    try—whenever I campaigned politically—to go after the Spanish-speaking vote and
                    generally got it, which used to drive the Democrats who opposed me out of their
                    tree. We would travel frequently to Spanish-speaking countries because it was
                    fun. While I had command of the language, easily read it, my writing of it
                    became rusty and when I got to Guatemala it took me a couple months to get that
                    back. At one point, when I was very young, I could speak Spanish as well as I
                    spoke English. When I left Guatemala I still wasn't back, even after three and a
                    half years down in that country. I still wasn't there because I think an older
                    tongue doesn't put itself around a language as quickly as a younger tongue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. But you had this facility with Spanish and that was
                        your other language besides English. You didn't speak any other languages,
                        right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: (chuckles) Just curse a lot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. So let's pick up then with 1988. How did it come to
                        pass that you were...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: Well after the election, of course, I called the then President-elect to
                    congratulate him, and he said, well, you know, the usual thing, “I couldn't have
                    done it without all you guys helping,” and “How wonderful you are,” and he said,
                    “I know you wanted to serve in the administration, and I'm going to have Chase
                    (Untermeyer),” whom I knew was one of his assistants and is going to be in
                    charge of White House personnel, “and I'm going to have Chase call you. And I
                    want you to come back serve in the administration.” He was right. I had wanted
                    to serve—with Poppy Bush you never state the obvious...because if you jump up
                    and down and state the obvious and wave your hands and arms and say, “Here I
                    am!” his inclination is to look past you and at someone else. He doesn't want
                    anybody who wants it too much, and I think maybe I learned something from that.
                    I think that's smart. But there was never any doubt in all the relationship
                    between us that if he ever got to a position like that that I would like to
                    serve in his administration.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>So when Chase (Untermeyer) called me two weeks later as they were putting
                    together the transition team, I had to tell him that I felt obligated to delay
                    because of the manner in which the legislature session was headed. I was
                    Chairman of the Appropriations Committee and we were having a terrible fight
                    over the budget. I was very interested in 1) preserving educational finance, 2)
                    raising a welfare scheme called a “family payment plan” and 3) not raising
                    taxes. I thought I had seen a way to do that. I talked to some of my friends and
                    was told if I left everything that I was interested in those areas, then they
                    were going to go down the tubes. Since I felt committed to the Governor and the
                    people who had elected me to at least finish out that term, I felt that I had to
                    go to the Wyoming Session of the legislature in 1989. But I told Chase to tell
                    the President that when the Session was over in March I would be very interested
                    in serving. Untermeyer left it with me that when the Session was over that I
                    should call him and that they were considering me for a position in the Agency
                    for International Development because I spoke Spanish, probably the Assistant
                    Administrator for Latin Affairs. That was in the phone conversation. So the
                    Wyoming Session ended—rather successfully I thought—in March of 1989, and maybe
                    a week after I had gotten home and collected my breath and gotten all the junk
                    off my desk, I called Chase (Untermeyer) in the White House and left word. He
                    called back, and I said, “There is a meeting in Washington that the National
                    Council of State Legislature is putting on that begins in about two weeks—the
                    end of March. It's for the presidents and vice presidents of the Senate and
                    Speakers and the Speaker pro tems the Houses of all the state legislators. It's
                    going to be a leadership meeting, and I'm planning to go with the president of
                    the Wyoming Senate.” Marta and I and Russ Zimmer and his wife Ila, went, and it
                    provided me a perfect opportunity. So we made an appointment for me to meet with
                    Chase at the White House. At that point he was still talking about the assistant
                    directorship of AID for Latin America.</p>
                <p>In the meantime I made some investigations. Tim Stanley, a classmate of mine at
                    Yale who's been very influential in Foreign Affairs and was Chairman of the
                    Atlantic Council, looked into it. The word that I got back was that it was not a
                    position that I would not much enjoy. In the first place I'd have to live in
                    Washington, which wasn't really what I had in mind. In the second place you were
                    constantly fighting for your turf. It was a very “turf-conscious” battle. The
                    Latin America Division of AID was constantly neglected because the big money in
                    AID went to Israel and Egypt. The Treasury Department was constantly trying to
                    take away your area as the increase in commercial activity picked up. Commerce
                    was in your way. It was a deal in which you were constantly fighting off others.
                    The director of AID at the time, a Dr. Brown, was seriously ill. He was known to
                    be dying of cancer, and when he left you had no idea who the director might be.
                    So my question to Chase was, “Chase, I understand all of this. If the
                    directorship becomes vacant, do I have a shot at that job?” He said, “Absolutely
                    not.” He said, “That will not be the president's appointment. That will be an
                    appointment made by Jim Baker, who was then Secretary of State.” And I said, “I
                    know Jim. Maybe I can go talk to him.” And he says, “No, that's not the way it
                    works.”</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>This was the gist of our conversation. I thought about it and the day I left
                    Washington I called him up and I said, “Chase, that's not a job I'm interested
                    in, and while I appreciate the consideration, thanks an awful lot.” And went
                    home and told Marta on the way back, “Well, that's probably the end of any offer
                    we'll ever get from the Bushes.” I said, “You don't turn these guys down. So I
                    won't hear anymore about it.” A couple of weeks went by and I had the
                    opportunity to go back to the inauguration of Dick Cheney as Secretary of
                    Defense. At the inauguration I spoke to Dick, and he asked, “What are you going
                    to do?” I told him the story. He said, “Well, what would you really like?” I
                    said, “Well, if I really could wave a magic wand, I'd like to be the ambassador
                    to Argentina because I could use my Spanish and I wouldn't have to live in
                    Washington and it's a fascinating, challenging job.” I said, “I don't want to be
                    ambassador in a country where all you do is drink tea and be social. I want to
                    do something.” He said, “Well, let me talk to the President about that and let
                    me talk to Jim Baker because I see them all the time.”</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>So I went back to Wyoming and about a week later—this is now about the second
                    week in April—the phone rang and it was the President on the phone. He said,
                    “Dick has talked to me and I've talked to Jim,” and he said, “We'd like to have
                    you serve as an ambassador.” He said, “The trouble with the one you want is—I
                    understand the one you want is Argentina—the trouble with that is that one of
                    the most senior Foreign Service officers on the professional staff, who also
                    happens to be black, is a man by the name of Terence Todman, and he has already
                    been picked by the Department to have that job, and I don't want to disturb that
                    situation.” He said, “But would you consider either Uruguay or Guatemala?” I
                    said, “Well, Mr. President, of course I would be happy to consider it.” He said,
                    again, “Get in touch with Chase.” So again I got a hold of Tim Stanley, and he
                    scouted among his friends and he said that Guatemala would be fascinating. It
                    was a difficult country with a lot of problems. There was a guerrilla war going
                    on. There were ethnic and racial considerations. It was close to the United
                    States and yet a scene of great turmoil. Whereas Uruguay was a long ways away;
                    it was very placid, much smaller, and there wasn't nearly as much that was
                    challenging to do. If it was his choice—if what I wanted was a fun job and to go
                    to wonderful beaches, I should go to Uruguay, but if what I wanted was a job
                    with a challenge, I should go to Guatemala. So I called Chase Untermeyer and
                    said, “Well, if I have a choice, the choice I would make is Guatemala, but of
                    course I would take either one.” I didn't want to put myself into a position of
                    being the dog in a manger again. The next day I got a call from Chase saying,
                    “The President is going to nominate you to go Guatemala; you can't say anything
                    to anybody.” And I said, “Well, I have to talk now to my wife about this.” He
                    said, “Well, the President's going to call. . .” and I said, “I'll talk to her
                    tonight.” So at eight o'clock in the morning I got to the office, having talked
                    to Marta late into the night and having agreed we would do it. And the phone
                    rang and it was the President, who knows Marta. He said, “Well, I know you
                    talked Marta into it so I want you to do this and come back, and I'm pleased
                    you're going to do this.” Marta and I had planned a one week vacation at
                    Windemere Island in the Bahamas, leaving in about three days, and I said, “Mr.
                    President, does it make any difference to the administration and you if Marta
                    and I go on this one week vacation? It's liable to be the last vacation we get
                    for a while, I would think. And then I'll come down to Washington.” And he said,
                    “No, that's fine.” But he said, “Can you keep your mouth shut?” and I said, “Not
                    only can I keep my mouth shut, but if I'm out of the country, no one's going to
                    know about it.” So we went to the Windemere Island. Alan Simpson, our United
                    States senator and dear good friend had been trying for months to get some
                    Wyoming people appointed to positions. Actually to go back a long way, I had
                    introduced Alan to President Bush when Alan was a new senator and Bush was a new
                    Vice President, and they became very, very dear friends. They became better
                    friends one of the other than I of either. Alan had been working on the
                    President on my behalf. Alan couldn't stand it when he found out. He had to tell
                    somebody, and he told Peter Wold, a young oil man from Casper who was visiting
                    him. Peter got back to Casper, and pretty soon in Casper the word was all over
                    that I was going to be the appointed ambassador. But they had the countries all
                    wrong and they didn't know where. In the meantime Marta and I are out of the
                    country and not supposed to say anything about it to anybody. When we got back
                    on the 28th of April the President made the official announcement of his
                    intention to appoint me, and I started to wind up my business affairs. That's
                    how it happened.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, I'd like to go back and pick up one point that I
                        didn't ask you about. Of course, you hadn't had a career in the Foreign
                        Service, but my recollection from all the years that I've been associated
                        with your family is that you've always had an Interest in American
                        diplomatic history.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: Oh, I love American history, but that's because when I was in Loomis
                    School in Windsor, Connecticut a History teacher by the name of Lou Fowles
                    excited my imagination with history. I've always read all I could about American
                    history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So at the point where you had been appointed now, or
                        nominated as the U.S. ambassador to Guatemala, had you had any opportunity
                        to read about the history of that region?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: Oh, well, I—sure, sure. I remember once when I was in college writing a
                    paper on the Monroe Doctrine. Was I any expert on Latin American affairs? Hell
                    no. Had I read about it and studied about it? Yes, and I've lived, as I said,
                    two summers in Cuba. I had some firm opinions about how screwed up our relations
                    with Cuba were and how they had gotten that way largely because of our own
                    errors and not because of force of events. There's no room on this tape, but I
                    know something about how Castro came to power in Cuba, and he came into power
                    because we screwed up. He could have been a friend of ours had we played it
                    intelligently instead of being an enemy for these past 37 years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd also like you to talk for a minute or two about your
                        management style as you developed it from running your own business and what
                        thoughts you had as you were going into the process now of running a much
                        larger organization in Guatemala.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>STROOCK: Well, I learned about management from my time in the United States
                    Marine Corps. And then when I got this job and found out that the Guatemalan
                    Embassy was huge, over 800 people. It was the “regional” sort of embassy for
                    most of the regional Central American officers were there. I went to a friend of
                    mine named Rod Kinski who managed an enterprise that started out as a small
                    dairy in Wyoming and became a huge multi-state enterprise called “Mini Mart.” I
                    got from him his library on basic management. I had graduated in Industrial
                    Administration at college with courses in management, so I went back and read
                    some of the old textbooks that I had down in the basement. And my basic
                    management style is to 1) set an example: I naturally work hard. I get up early
                    and stay late, 2) to clearly set out the job to be done with the person
                    involved: Do you understand it? Do you know what we want to do? What is your
                    time frame, and give yourself lots of time. Don't tell me you can have it by the
                    15th if there's no way in hell you can have it by the 15th. If you think you can
                    have it by the 20th, give yourself a few days and say the 25th, but I expect
                    then for you to do the job—I don't care how you do it, but I expect it done on
                    the 25th. I've operated that way in small organizations and learned from reading
                    that that would probably translate very well to larger ones. My style was pretty
                    much: “This is what you're expected to do, this is when you're expected to do
                    it, and I want it on my desk by such and such a time. If you're not having any
                    problems I don't expect to hear from you. If something comes up that you don't
                    think you can handle, get back to me.” I used to tell the staff all the time
                    that I don't like surprises. If something goes wrong I want to know, and if you
                    think we need to change course I want to know that, too. It seemed to work in
                    private enterprise, and as the story will unfold, I think it worked very well in
                    Guatemala.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I also want to take just a second because you mentioned
                        that you learned some of your management from the Marine Corps and I'd like
                        you to just take a minute or two and recap your career in the Marine Corps.
                        That was during World War II, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: Well, yeah . . . I never got to be an officer. The highest rank I ever
                    had was Platoon Sergeant in the Marine Corps, but I saw how the Marine Corps
                    worked. I saw how authority was delegated and how the lieutenant didn't have
                    time to worry about the details of how the platoon sergeant did his job. He just
                    wanted the platoon ready, present and accounted for at 0600 hours equipped in
                    such and such a manner, ready to do such and such a job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just take a minute or two and give us the dates that you
                        were in the Marine Corps and where you were assigned for duty.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>STROOCK: I was in (God when did I get in?) in 1943 after my freshman year, I went
                    into the Marines, and I went to Paris Island in June of that year. And then I
                    was in the 10th Marine Artillery Regiment of the Second Marine Division and
                    joined them on the West Coast. We went to Auckland, New Zealand where we staged
                    for Guam. Then we were in Guam, Saipan and Tinian. And then my name with about
                    4,000 others dropped out of the old IBM card record files as having an IQ of x,
                    whatever x was, and one year of college. And they shipped us back to the United
                    States to go to Platoon Leaders Class in preparation for the attack on the
                    Japanese home islands which, thank God, never occurred or I probably wouldn't be
                    here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now I think we were at the point where you had now been
                        nominated as ambassador to Guatemala. Rather than going over the whole
                        confirmation process, if we have time maybe we can come back later and pick
                        that up at the end, but perhaps it would be best at this point to jump to
                        the point at which you were confirmed and then cover the preparation period
                        when you were getting ready to actually go to Guatemala.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: Well once I was confirmed, I was in Guatemala ten days later. There
                    wasn't much there, the preparation all came before. After I was nominated, they
                    sent me to what I laughingly call “charm school.” Well before I did that, of
                    course, they had the usual investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
                    the State Department Security. And there are a hundred funny stories to tell
                    about that. A favorite is that the guy came to me afterwards, and he said, “I
                    haven't had one person say a bad thing about you, Senator (because I was a State
                    Senator at the time).” But he said, “Everybody agrees that the President would
                    have been better off if he named your wife instead of you.” (Andrew Lowe
                    laughs)</p>
                <p>And the other one that's my favorite is my great pal, John Hilsom, who has since
                    unfortunately passed away, was interviewed in his office in New York, and
                    afterwards he sent me a telegram. He said, “Unpack your bags. They have just
                    interviewed me. You aren't even going to be able to get on the bus to
                    Guatemala!” (laughs)</p>
                <p>Then we went to what I call “charm school,” which was fascinating, and there were

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is “charm school?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: It's the Foreign Service Institute's course for ambassadors. Everybody
                    who's going to go out as the United States ambassador, has to go through this.
                    It was then three weeks—I think it's now two weeks because they've shortened
                    it—but the last week that they've shorted was the most fascinating one. It was
                    the one on security. You went down to New Brunswick, Georgia to the Federal Law
                    Enforcement Academy down there. “FLETC” they called them, and took
                    courses...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the other subjects that they taught in “charm
                        school?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: They teach you about how the State Department is organized. Since it's
                    constantly being reorganized you have to learn about that. They give you courses
                    in all the basics that are needed to be an ambassador. It's fascinating that
                    some of the old hands who were coming back, for instance Paul Cleveland, who'd
                    been the ambassador in New Zealand and was going out as ambassador to Malaysia,
                    said that he found it fascinating. George Sotirhos, who'd been the ambassador to
                    Jamaica and was going out now to Greece, found it fascinating—Certainly we did.
                    We made good friends with Paul and Mary Lambert, who had been named to go to
                    Ecuador, and to Loret Miller Ruppe had been named to go to Norway, we to
                    Guatemala. One of the interesting people in our class was a girl—a lady—by the
                    name of Joy Silverman, a handsome young woman from New York, who never got
                    confirmed. She really lacked an education, but with her personality she would
                    have been an excellent ambassador to the Barbados. But it's probably lucky she
                    didn't get named because a couple years later, she'd had an affair with a man by
                    the name of Wachtler, who was the Chief Justice of the New York Supreme Court.
                    He had threatened her and her child, and there was an awful, terrible, horrible,
                    scandalous lawsuit that fell on her.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: (Saw Watler?)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: Wachtler? Was that his name? It was all over the pages of The New York
                    Times. He threatened to kidnap her daughter. Joyce got divorced from her
                    husband, Jeff whom we met, and so probably it worked out well that the Congress
                    refused to confirm her.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What other preparation did you have for going to Guatemala
                        besides “charm school?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: Well, you are appointed a consultant to the Department, you're brought
                    into the Department and put down at the Guatemala desk, and you “read in,” as
                    they call it, everything there is to read about Guatemala and its history. I was
                    really fascinated by it, spent a lot of time doing that. You read the cables. .
                    . I spent the three weeks in “charm school,” and I spent two periods of two
                    weeks actually in the Department at the Guatemala desk. The other thing you do
                    is that you have to go around to the Congress, the Senators, and introduce
                    yourself so that you have a chance to meet one on one with the Senators who are
                    going to be important to your confirmation and who are either going to vote for
                    you or vote against you. I had a fascinating time doing that.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>Alan Simpson particularly was very, very helpful—Malcolm Wallop was helpful in
                    one incident: Staffers—and I can go on for hours about staffers to
                    Congressmen—but they're terribly important in the confirmation process, and one
                    of the staffers, on Jesse Helms' staff, a young lady by the name of Deborah
                    DeMoss had taken it into her head that, because I was pretty well-known in
                    Wyoming as Pro-Choice in the argument over women's rights, therefore I was
                    pro-abortion, and therefore I was not suitably equipped to be the representative
                    of a conservative administration in Latin America. Well, just because I'm
                    Pro-Choice doesn't mean I'm pro-abortion, I think it has to do with individual
                    rights. She was giving me unmerciful Hell and Jesse Helms was threatening to
                    hold up my name, and Malcolm Wallop, who was one of Jesse Helms very good
                    friends, spoke to him on my behalf. Then, Senator Jesse Helms, invited me to
                    come over and meet him personally at the Senate. He escorted me up to the
                    Senator's personal visitor's gallery and sat with me and told me in his charming
                    liquid southern accent that any friend of Malcolm's was a friend of his, and
                    that he would do everything he could to push my nomination through. Since he was
                    the ranking Republican on the committee, he did. And I had very little trouble
                    getting nominated, except we could never get the damn committee to sit still to
                    hold nomination hearings. The nomination process has gotten lengthy, sloppy and
                    nasty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The confirmation process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: The whole process by which the Senate confirms the president's
                    nominations. A raft of us were held up, not because of any feeling on the part
                    of senators that we were or weren't competent. They were willing to confirm us
                    as individuals, but they had fights with the administration over totally
                    extraneous matters: committee jurisdictions, bills that involved countries that
                    we were never connected with. One of the things that I'm doing now with the
                    Council of American Ambassadors is try to see if Council can't bring some
                    decency, sanity, and time reference back to the nomination process. Frankly, I
                    was non-controversial, yet it took from May until October to get a
                    non-controversial person confirmed—that's six months. Now it's taking a year.
                    The confirmation process is ugly and unfortunate and needs to be speeded up. It
                    needs to be focused on the rabbit and not only on extraneous bushes in which the
                    rabbit might hide.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any meetings with the President before you
                        went down to Guatemala?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>STROOCK: Yes. This is after I was confirmed. My hearing was on September 22nd and
                    my official swearing in was on October 10th, and we got to Guatemala on October
                    18th. Between October 10th and October 18th we went through Washington to pick
                    up all the final documents and instructions. A lady at the State Department
                    named Sharon Bisdee who's marvelous, handles all of this, and she'd been working
                    with me since my actual nomination back in May. One of the things she organized
                    was an interview with the President in the Oval Office: that was exciting and
                    fun. Marta and I went there and, of course, the President knew us personally, it
                    was very warm and very cordial. He had a photographer there, taking pictures,
                    and when Marta came in, he bent down to kiss her. Marta moved her head so that
                    he would kiss her on one cheek and he moved his head so that he would kiss her
                    on the other cheek. Their foreheads bumped, and the photographer got a picture
                    of that. The President sent it to Marta with a note in it in his own handwriting
                    on the bottom which said, “Dear Marta, Oops! Your friend, George.” He was very
                    kind and generous with us.</p>
                <p>We spoke very little of substance at the time. He told me that I would be getting
                    my instructions in writing, that I had already received instructions of the
                    State Department, which I had—I had long conversations with Bernard Aronson, the
                    Assistant Secretary of State who had been confirmed in June and was grabbing
                    hold of the Inter-American Bureau called “ARA” in State Department parlance.
                    Mostly what he said was, “If you need me, call me.” I had his private number and
                    I knew his secretaries from previous political lives. As I best remember he told
                    me to remember that Guatemala is crucial to our entire Latin American program,
                    and our Latin American Program is to expand trade there and to become really
                    good neighbors. He was really concerned about the war on drugs, he was very
                    concerned about the interdiction of drugs, and he was very concerned about the
                    coming election in Guatemala. This now is in October of 1989, and there is an
                    election coming up in Guatemala in exactly one year—in October of 1990. The
                    President was concerned that the existing democratically-elected regime headed
                    by Vinicio Cerezo, turnover control of the country to a legitimately,
                    democratically-elected government. He was very strongly promoting democracy and
                    very strongly promoting the control of drugs in Central America. Those were the
                    substantive conversations we had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just for anyone who may be listening to this tape, part of
                        our instructions are that any time we use State Department lingo, we're
                        supposed to say what it means. So you used the phrase, ARA. Would you say
                        what that means?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: American. . . Republics. . . Agency. I never did understand—It's the
                    Assistant Secretary of State for (Inter-American) Affairs, and how that gets
                    translated to “ARA”—I believe it's “American Republics Agency.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you said Bernard Aronson was about to become the head
                        of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>STROOCK: He had been nominated, confirmed in June. Bernie Aaronson was the only
                    Democrat in the Republican political hierarchy in the State Department, and he
                    had been named Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, and had you already met with Mr. Aaronson before you
                        met with President Bush?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: Oh yes. I met Bernie early on when I first got there in June it was just
                    before his confirmation process, and he was there on sort of an advisory
                    capacity. There was no one in the Assistant Secretary's chair.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he give you a substantive briefing before you...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: Oh yes. He and I had several conversations over the course of that
                    summer, both before and after my attendance of the school and then while I was
                    down on the Guatemala desk and I came up to a couple meetings in his office that
                    dealt specifically with Guatemala. Q: Can you list what things were high on his
                    agenda? Issues for Guatemala?</p>
                <p>STROOCK: Quite frankly I'm the guy who established the agenda of issues for
                    Guatemala. The big problems in Guatemala when I got there were the concern about
                    drugs; the concern about the two attempted coups from the military, were going
                    to try to take over from the facade, of democracy that the country had; and the
                    fact that the country's economy, which had been very sound, seemed to be
                    teetering on the rocks, they were headed for big-time inflation; and, as well
                    endemic corruption down there was a concern.</p>
                <p>Guatemala had always been a spot that the United States could count on because we
                    had supported their military regimes, and as long as the military regime worked
                    with us, we were prepared to tolerate the excesses of that regime. We were very
                    concerned about Soviet influence in Central America. When I got there in October
                    of 1989 the Soviet influence in Central America was still a major concern.
                    Aronson's mission when he came on board was to take over the Nicaraguan
                    situation and put the contra situation off the map; to stop fighting with
                    Congress over what we should do in Nicaragua; to withdraw as best as might be
                    from the support of the contras; to promote as best we could some kind of a
                    reasonable solution to the horrible situation in Nicaragua. It was infecting and
                    poisoning our relationship with Congress about all of Latin America. Aronson's
                    job was to calm those waters; and he did it very effectively. His policies
                    towards Guatemala were all aimed at, “If we do this in Guatemala, how will that
                    reflect back on the Contra-Sandinista war in Nicaragua, and what will the effect
                    be on our position across all of Latin America. All these relationships were
                    very complex.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>General Werner had been named the head of Southern command in Panama. General
                    Werner was an extremely able officer, but in Panama there was this terrible
                    problem with Manuel Noriega. He was the Panamanian army officer who at one time
                    had been on our CIA payroll but had become a drug overlord and a gangster.
                    Panama was the center of drug traffic, and thus was the center of terrible
                    problems for the United States in many ways. While the sentiment in the Bush
                    administration was that we had to use physical force to take Noriega out, Werner
                    didn't want to do that. He felt that would reflect back badly on Nicaragua.
                    Secretary of State Jim Baker and Aronson believed that they had to act firmly in
                    Panama, otherwise the Nicaraguans would think they could get away with anything
                    and probably would try to get away with anything, might even try to ally
                    themselves with Noriega.</p>
                <p>So the first casualty—and I saw it firsthand while I was in the Department—was
                    that they removed General Werner from command, rather abruptly as a matter of
                    fact, from Southern Command, and placed General Maxwell Thurman in his place.
                    Max Thurman and I got to be friends, and Max got to his job in Southern Command
                    just about a week or two before I go to my job in Guatemala. It was interesting
                    to watch him inter-act with Bernie Aaronson. They changed what had been a policy
                    of banging heads with the Congress, into one of, “How can we accomplish what we
                    want to accomplish with the Congress; keep Soviet influence out of Central
                    America; and still interdict drugs and still promote democracy.” That was the
                    stew that was bubbling and cooking for Central America the whole time I was in
                    Washington.</p>

                        our relations with Nicaragua on the other hand and all of Latin America, and
                        the developing problems with General Noriega in Panama.</hi>

                <p>STROOCK: There was another development in the stew that one had to take into
                    account: and that was the long guerrilla war that started in 1960. There were at
                    the time as many as many as five thousand and perhaps as few as one thousand
                    guerrillas still active in the high mountains in the Altiplano of Guatemala.
                    They were the leftovers from what had been a very dangerous guerrilla movement
                    that almost succeeded in taking over the country in the late '70's and early
                    '80's. As we sit here and speak there are still remnants of that guerrilla
                    movement shooting up people in the jungles and the high mountains, occasionally
                    blowing up bridges and destroying electric towers. The guerillas are
                    increasingly marginal to Guatemala future, but there really will be no important
                    forward movement in Guatemalan society until that guerrilla war is brought to a
                    close. all the issues that you just listed are impinged on by that guerrilla
                    war, so an attempt to do something to shut down the guerrilla war was also in
                    the mix of concerns that the United States had and still has.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe the most orderly way to do this would be to take
                        these subjects one at a time and to track through your experiences in the
                        three and one-half years that you were in Guatemala subject by subject, and
                        of course as we go there'll be inter-relationships. I'll let you choose—but
                        you know we had drugs, the political problems, the upcoming election, the
                        guerrilla war, the general relationship with Nicaragua...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: When I first got to the State Department everybody was busy with their
                    own particular piece of the Central American pie, and nobody had truly
                    concentrated on the slice of the pie that said, “Guatemala.” The “Guatemala”
                    piece in the puzzle was still to be solved, and I rapidly realized that no one
                    was going to do it except myself. So while it was “studying in”, I decided that
                    I would try and keep things simple—in accordance with that management style that
                    you mentioned—try to concentrate on what in Spanish came to known as “los
                    Quatros D's,” “The Four D's,” They were drugs—of course not for drugs, but
                    against drugs, democracy, development, and human rights. Human rights doesn't
                    begin with “d” in English, but it does in Spanish, (”d...”). And drugs is
                    (”drogas,” and democracy is “democracia,” and development is “desarrollo...”).
                    So you can call them the “Four D's” in Spanish, and we did.</p>
                <p>In my opening statement at the airport when I arrived and in my opening speech to
                    the mission—which I called an “all hands on deck” speech, and in my opening
                    conversations with President Cerezo, I concentrated on the “Four D's”. I made
                    them our keystones and I would constantly refer to them. It got to the point
                    where people wanted to throw up when they heard me talk about them. But they did
                    become the focus of the mission, and we did, I think, make progress in all four
                    areas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's take one “D” at a time. You want to start with
                        drugs?</hi>

                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>STROOCK: Well, drugs was the one that most directly affected the average citizen
                    in the United States. There were two drug problems in Guatemala. The first was
                    the actual cultivation of the poppy flower in the narrow high valleys of the
                    Northern Altiplano, the ones in Guatemala that lead up northward into Mexico.
                    They're very deep; they're very narrow; they're ideal for cultivating poppy. The
                    small farmers take the poppy seed out to Mexico where it's chemically treated
                    and becomes heroin. We found only two chemical installations, you couldn't even
                    call them laboratories, that would turn the poppy into crude heroin in Guatemala
                    itself. Mostly what happened was that the poppy plant was picked, placed on
                    mules and taken on back dirt roads up to Mexico to be treated and turned into
                    heroin there.</p>
                <p>We were very involved trying to stop all this when I got there. We had our own
                    air force of six helicopters and six thrush airplanes, all under private
                    contractors reporting to the Drug Enforcement Agency, the DEA, to fumigate,
                    poison and eradicate poppy seed. We used to make large claims about how many
                    acres of poppy we had eradicated. I went along on a couple of these airplane
                    spraying trips. I never went in the thrushes because they would dive down into
                    those valleys, and I wasn't sure they were ever going to come out. Those thrush
                    pilots were brave guys. They would go into every valley and spray. I did go
                    twice in the helicopter gunships flying up above as protection and looked down.
                    Negotiating these efforts was tricky. An American plane had been shot down over
                    Nicaragua running contraband to the contras. They didn't want the same thing to
                    happen in Guatemala, which was why the U.S. armed forces never were involved. It
                    was a very inefficient way to operate, but nevertheless that's the way it had to
                    be. We had to secure permission from the Guatemalan government to allow us to
                    run these secret contract operations in their country. We had to base the
                    plane's pilots on Guatemalan air force bases, and we needed the cooperation of
                    the Guatemalan army. Well the Guatemalan army is a part of the problem, not part
                    of the solution in Guatemala. While they were and are very constructive and
                    necessary to us in the war on drugs, they also are one of the big threats to
                    growing democracy. They are one of the great causes of the violations of human
                    rights endemic in the country. Some of them were part of the drug organization.
                    They have an enormous influence on the country's ability in every area because
                    they are forty three thousand of them, they're disciplined, and they are the
                    only agency in the country that really works. We can get into that later, but in
                    many of these small, unstable societies it takes the military to make things
                    happen—no other agency, public or private, has the necessary money or
                    organization or manpower.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>In any event they were the only people we had to work with. In the three and a
                    half years we were there I desperately tried to move our drug enforcement
                    dependency from the army to a civilian police force—the (”Guardia Civil”), the
                    treasury agents. As I left we had succeeded in establishing some basic treasury
                    organizations that were involved in seeking out those who would transport drugs
                    and contraband into Guatemala, which was the second problem. We never succeeded
                    in getting our program of spraying and fumigating and trying to kill poppy
                    plants away from the necessity of cooperating with the Guatemalan army. We
                    absolutely needed their logistical bases. We couldn't operate without them. We
                    needed their permission to fly over the country because we couldn't do without
                    that. We needed frequently to call on them for repairs to our equipment. They
                    could have shut us down overnight, and they frequently threatened to do just
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they ever demand concessions in return for permission
                        to operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: That was the whole fight. My frequent conversations with the various
                    officers in the Guatemalan army almost always carried the implied threat of
                    cooperate or your drug effort will suffer. When we cut off military aid in
                    December of 1990, which is another story, the thought was that we had just blown
                    the poppy interdiction program because the military would shut it down. They
                    didn't because we were working with them through the back door of the Central
                    Intelligence Agency, which is again yet another story. But in our relationships
                    with all Guatemalan government officials, and with the army in particular, we
                    had constantly to keep in mind that we were interdicting and fumigating poppies
                    in San Marcos province, at their sufferance, and they could shut down that
                    program at any time. The farmers whose poppy was being fumigated didn't like it
                    at all. There was a tremendous uproar all the time claiming that we were
                    destroying and causing peasants to lose their legitimate crops, none of which
                    was ever proven and none of which was true. Nevertheless at least once a month
                    we got a complaint about that. It was a very involved and dicey situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any other aspect to the war on drugs in
                        Guatemala other than eradicating poppy fields?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>STROOCK: Yes. The biggest part of our drug problem was that Guatemala
                    increasingly became a way station for transmitting cocaine from South America
                    into the North American market. The coca plant itself is principally grown in
                    Peru. It is shipped into Colombia where it is made into cocaine. Then the
                    Colombians want to bring it into the United States. They used to bring it up in
                    boats through the Caribbean, but our naval interdiction efforts in the Caribbean
                    got very efficient, so they started shipping through Guatemala. The whole time I
                    was in Guatemala we had five United States Navy cruisers with radar and antenna
                    and support, cruising off the coasts of Colombia attempting to track drug
                    flights in airplanes and speedboats, leaving Colombia. They would come up to
                    Guatemala and Mexico then transship and the cocaine would go up into the United
                    States. Guatemala was an ideal place to do that because of the large farms, the
                    large banana plantations, the large coffee fincas, the large sugar ingenios, and
                    the large cattle ranches all had air strips. It was easy to drop into these air
                    strips and transship from planes to either mules or human beings or trucks or
                    other airplanes.</p>
                <p>To patrol this interdiction effort we had a very large DEA presence in the
                    embassy. We had a Guatemala City Office Chief, five DEA agents and two pilots.
                    There was constantly the desire to expand the operation and to make the DEA
                    bigger. We had something called “Operation Cadence,” which had its own staff of
                    people who were rotated in and out of Guatemala. The whole time we were there, I
                    think we seized a total of maybe sixty tons of cocaine. Our biggest haul was one
                    haul of about thirteen tons as I remember, which was towards the very end of my
                    stay there. This caused a Colombian hit team to come into the country, so we
                    heard, to try and kill me. This was why in my last month there, I made public
                    appearances with a flak jacket on, which was very uncomfortable and very damned
                    unpleasant. We were successful, I think, in training the Guardia Civil—the
                    Treasury—Police to become effective in this area. We did succeed in getting the
                    extradition of five drug traffickers under extradition treaties. That was an
                    enormous political effort to get that to happen. We did have pretty good
                    information on drug trafficking, and drug interdiction across all of Latin
                    America became the number one mission of the United States Southern Command
                    after Noriega was taken out of Panama, and after General George Joulman became
                    the commander in chief of Southern Command succeeding Max (Thurman). That was
                    the mission that George seized on as being the most effective thing he could do.
                    I had several meeting with him, several in Guatemala and two in Panama where we
                    got to be friends. George was right because he said, of all the things we did,
                    this was the one that would affect most on American society and therefore
                    justified the American taxpayer dollars being spent. He was hopeful that we
                    could make a serious dent in the drug transshipments.</p>
                <p>I wonder if we ever did. I am convinced after three and a half years that we did
                    not win the war on drugs. It's still going on, and I think we're losing. I think
                    we need to do something else, but at least a quarter of my time as ambassador
                    was spent dealing with the interdiction problem, with the cultivation problem
                    and with the extradition problem.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>We would try to stop the poppy from growing, we would try and interdict the flow
                    of cocaine through the country, and we would try and find out the people who
                    were involved with it and extradite them to the United States. Sometimes we
                    weren't even so delicate or diplomatically nice as to extradite them. There was
                    a Nicaraguan citizen, a known drug Kingpin, named Gadea, who came into the
                    country. We knew he was coming and we got the Guardia Civil to nab him as he got
                    off the plane, and we got them to put him on a special plane that was flown down
                    by the United States Marshal for Florida where there was a warrant out for his
                    arrest. All of this was done outside the extradition treaty, because he was an
                    undesirable alien. This was legal except the Guatemalans, in their hurry, forgot
                    to go through all the legal steps they had to do through the court. Where that
                    guy is today, I don't know, but we got him out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say, “Got him out,” you mean you got him onto the
                        airplane...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: Got him on the airplane and into the hands of the U.S. court in
                    Florida.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So he was arrested in court?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: That's right. We legally extradited under a very complicated extradition
                    treaty. it takes months to do. Some important figures, including Arnoldo Vargas,
                    the mayor of Zacapa and a key figure in the old Cali cartel, a known murderer, a
                    real thief had controlled (Zacapa) province for years. He had been involved in
                    transshipping cocaine for years, and we proved it. We got him, we extradited him
                    to the United States under the extradition treaties; and we got four others as
                    well. Sue Patterson the Consul General, one of the most dynamic ladies I've ever
                    met—she was not only attractive, but very bright and very hardworking; was
                    crucial in getting those guys, and the Guatemalans were fascinated by having
                    this very attractive, bright, petite American woman really pounding on their
                    tables to get these extraditions accomplished. Again with the management theory
                    we discussed, I would go with her when she wanted me to, and she would want me
                    to go when it got really sticky with the Army. Otherwise she did it alone and
                    she deserves a lot of credit.</p>
                <p>So we did make a difference in the war on drugs, but it did take up a lot of
                    time, and we didn't make enough of a difference. We won some battles, but we
                    never did win the damn war, and I don't know if the war is winnable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the war on drugs linked in any way with the corruption
                        problem in Guatemala?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>STROOCK: Yes. Unfortunately, half the history of small Latin American nations is
                    one of corruption, and drugs brought in a tremendous amount of money that
                    flooded through the country. The claim in Guatemala was that the guerrillas were
                    using drug money. The second president that I had to deal with, Jorge Serrano,
                    used to claim that all the time, but he wasn't always right. I'm sure that there
                    was some drug smuggling going on with the guerrillas, but the biggest amount of
                    the drug smuggling that was going on was with the rich new entrepreneurs and the
                    army, and we never could find out where that was done because they were very
                    clever, very well connected and very organized.</p>
                <p>

                        army was actually cooperating with the transshipping of drugs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: No the army as an institution was actively cooperating in suppressing
                    it, but individual army officers and soldiers were bought indeed. There's no
                    question about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were they actually being bribed to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: Yes, to look the other way or help as drugs were transshipped in all
                    parts of the operation. Many of our pieces of our information led us to believe
                    that lower ranking army officers—majors, lieutenants colonels—were involved.
                    Cerezo turned a deaf ear to that, but Serrano, the second president was a
                    strong, born-again evangelical Protestant—really hated that idea in his guts. He
                    really moved heaven and earth to try and shut it down, but even he wasn't
                    successful. We got our best cooperation from Serrano in this area of drug
                    interdiction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you talk about “shut it down,” are you talking about
                        shutting down corruption or shutting down drugs or both?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: Shutting down drugs. Serrano himself was terribly corrupt, so he wasn't
                    at all good at shutting down corruption, but he did want to try and shut down
                    drug trafficking, and yet it didn't happen. The huge amount of money available
                    through drugs was a big part of the large corruption problem in Guatemala. Many
                    money laundering operations took place. We held classes trying to train the
                    financial institutions in the country how to recognize and handle
                    money-laundering, but we never really did a good job because we don't know how
                    to handle it ourselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you speak out at any time about corruption?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>STROOCK: Oh Lord, it got to the point where I think they were tired of it. I
                    started out by saying that Guatemalans made a business out of , hell an art, out
                    of not paying taxes. I would say that they couldn't expect United States
                    taxpayers to support activities in their own country that their own taxpayers
                    refused to support. I would talk about corruptions in generalities because there
                    are some things that as an ambassador that you just can't say. To remain
                    effective, you couldn't say that you were convinced the president was corrupt.
                    You just couldn't do that. I had to maintain a relationship with him. I really
                    had to try and be his friend. But you could say that some of his friends were
                    involved. The first big drug incident that I got involved in, shortly after I
                    arrived there, illustrates this conundrum. The President, Cerezo, appointed one
                    of his buddies, a former colonel by the name of Hugo Moran, as director of the
                    port of Santo Thomas. Just before I arrived in Guatemala, Hugo Moran had been
                    involved in a drug transshipment at La Aurora, the main airport of Guatemala. He
                    and two of his cronies were involved in drug trafficking up to their eyeballs.
                    The CIA, the intelligence station, and the DEA, the drug enforcement agency, had
                    the proof. They even had pictures of these guys carrying the stuff out of the
                    airport. To get Moran out of the town, Cerezo named him as the chairman of the
                    Port of Santo Thomas, which is the country's leading port. Eighty percent of the
                    country's imports and exports go through there. A lot of drugs are transshipped.
                    This was just an open license to conduct illegal activities. Many of our
                    officers believed that President Cerezo himself was involved because his brother
                    definitely was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was like putting a fox in charge of the
                        henhouse...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: Exactly! So I went to the president and spoke to him about it. I made a
                    special trip down there to the palace for that purpose only. We would have
                    breakfast once a month—and I would bring it up each time, but three months went
                    by, and he hadn't done anything about it. At this same time, there was a flap
                    over the visas that were being requested by Guatemalan congressmen. They were
                    being held up because the congressmen refused to fill out certain forms. Sue
                    Patterson, our Consul General, felt that while they were entitled almost
                    automatically to visitor's visas to the United States on official visits, they
                    were asking for official visas to do private business. She was trying to make a
                    point, that congressmen should not expect special privileges from the United
                    States Consul General—in direct contradiction to the way they operated in their
                    country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Guatemalan congressmen?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>STROOCK: Yes. Sue was holding up four or five visas. I went down to see the
                    Interior Minister to ask that he cooperate with us in getting these Guatemalan
                    congressmen to clear their paperwork so we could issue them visas. When I came
                    out of his office after the interview, the press was waiting there for me. The
                    American ambassador attracted press down there. On TV and radio and newspapers
                    and everything else, they wanted to know why we were holding up these visas;
                    denying these visas were the claims. I said that we weren't “denying” any visas.
                    We were just requesting that everybody in Guatemala go through the same
                    procedures. Congressmen were, in our view, no more entitled to special
                    privileges than any other Guatemalan citizen, just as in our country. The press
                    insisted, “Well you are denying visas,” and I said, “No, since I've gotten here,
                    we've only denied two visas.” “And whose were those?” I said, “One of them is a
                    mayor of a small town up in the Peten, who is known as an illegal alien
                    smuggler, a 'coyote,' and we're not going to give him a visa. The other is
                    Colonel Hugo Moran, who we believe to be involved in drug trafficking. As far as
                    we're concerned Colonel Moran's activities have made him undesirable and we
                    don't want him in our country.” Well, that certainly created a storm. It's the
                    only time in our two year relationship that President Cerezo really got very
                    personally angry at me. He thought I put him down personally. And I told him,
                    “No Mr. President I didn't put you down personally, I just got tired of waiting
                    for you to act.” (chuckles) I'm just picking out one incident out of maybe
                    fifty, but there were fifty of them just like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe its time to move to the second “D,” democracy. That
                        would have been heavily tied up in the upcoming election. . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: Yes. Well, at the time the big concern was that the Christian Democrats,
                    who had controlled the congress—they had fifty-two out of the hundred
                    deputies—and who also controlled the Presidency had a candidate by the name of
                    Alfonso Cabrera. He had been the foreign minister and State Secretary Shultz
                    hated him because he lied to him. He was reputed to be heavily involved in drug
                    trafficking. There was no question that Cabrera's older brother was a drug
                    trafficker. He went to jail. There's no question that a large amount of drug
                    money supported Cabrera's political ambitions. He flew around the country in a
                    helicopter owned by a drug king named Escobar. He had known ties to both Cali
                    and Medellin cartels. But I must say that I was never convinced that Cabrera
                    himself was involved in drug trafficking. It's just that if he had become
                    president, he had so many chits out to those who were involved in drug
                    trafficking that it would have been impossible to control. Furthermore, the army
                    did not like Cabrera. We had all kinds of information that had he become
                    elected, they would have moved against him and overthrown the government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me stop you for just a second. The president when you
                        arrived was Vinicio Cerezo.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And how had he come to power?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: He was legitimately and democratically elected in 1985. The story of the
                    Cerezo election has been covered many times before and we shouldn't take the
                    time to go into it here, but he had the opportunity to be the George Washington
                    and Abraham Lincoln-rolled-into-one in his country. But he blew his chances and
                    suffered two coups, in which he succeeded in escaping narrowly with his life and
                    his government. The last two years of his administration, when I was there, he
                    didn't care really whether school kept or not. He was there to enrich himself,
                    which he did. He was personally corrupt. He took money, to our certain
                    knowledge, from education funds, and from road funds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And he shipped the money off shore, didn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: I haven't any clear idea what he did with it, I just know that it
                    disappeared. He bought himself a yacht called “Odiseus” for one thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were talking about Cabrera and the...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: Anyhow Cerezo was the president. He was an extraordinarily likeable guy.
                    If he walked in the room right now, I would be glad to see him. As a human being
                    he was despicable, but as a personality he was lots of fun. He was a guy you
                    could always have a good time with. He liked jokes. He liked girls—he really did
                    like girls! He liked to drink.</p>
                <p>But he was corrupt, and in the last two years of his administration he didn't
                    care whether school kept or not. When the economy started to inflate, he didn't
                    even try to control things. In any event, Cabrera had been his buddy who helped
                    him get elected, and so he in turn now was committed politically to help Cabrera
                    get elected. Cabrera was the candidate of the Christian Democrat Party. There
                    was a strong central group, the National Central Union, headed by a guy who I
                    knew very well. He has since been killed very tragically; murdered by political
                    opponents, but it was covered up to look like a robbery. His name was Jorge
                    Carpio. His brother, Roberto, was Vinicio's Vice President. That gives you an
                    idea of how involved all these families are in politics.</p>
                <p>Carpio owned the newspaper, El Grafico, and he had been the candidate against
                    Cerezo in 1985 and had lost. He had built up a pretty important party that
                    controlled a number of seats in the congress. It was the second largest party in
                    the country, and he was a very viable candidate.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>Then there was the extreme right wing that had nominated an engineer who had
                    become an economist, by the name of Manuel Ayau. He had been the rector of
                    Franciso Maraquin University. He had dual citizenship, American citizenship and
                    Guatemalan citizenship. He was running as the candidate of the MLN, the extreme
                    right wing party. As the campaign developed it became obvious that he was going
                    no place, so he made a deal with the VCN. He came on board as Jorge Carpio's
                    vice president. So Carpio and Ayau ran as one team and Cabrera was the major
                    opposition. There were several smaller parties in the election that weren't
                    given much of a chance, including the MAS, the Action Socialista, which, despite
                    its name, was a conservative republican party, run by Jorge Serrano. He had been
                    an associate of General Rios Montt.</p>
                <p>Past histories will tell about the Rios Montt phenomenon. He seized power in 1983
                    and was forced out by the army 18 months later. In 1990, Rios Montt was running
                    for the presidency on the FRG ticket. The constitution that the country operated
                    on, and still operates on, was specifically designed to keep him from becoming
                    president because of the events in 1983-84. But he claimed that he had the right
                    to run for president. The truth of the matter is that there wasn't any question
                    in my mind that had he been allowed to run, had the constitution not
                    specifically prohibited him from running, he would have been overwhelmingly
                    elected on the first ballot, in 1990, because it was known that he personally
                    was not corrupt. He really shut down corruption in 1983 when he was
                    president.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>It was felt that the Cerezo regime was so corrupt, so lackadaisical, and the
                    economy was inflating so fast, with no one paying attention to the store, that
                    Rios Montt, despite all the evangelical Christian craziness that he had
                    demonstrated in the two years that he had been the usurper president, still was
                    the preferable candidate. The people believed that he would have brought order
                    out of chaos. The Guatemalan people believe that to this day. He's got to be
                    figured on when talking about the future of Guatemala. He is very definitely
                    there, and very definitely interested, and still an active man; he's in his
                    early sixties. A dynamic guy. Unfortunately for him, the Supreme Court ruled,
                    shortly before the elections, that he couldn't run. The voters were looking
                    around for someone who was as close to him as possible and they settled on Jorge
                    Serrano. Jorge Serrano is a very interesting personality, one of the most
                    interesting people I ever met; very difficult man. He was born-again Evangelical
                    Christian, whose main problem was that he would not listen. He was an engineer.
                    He wanted to handle everything himself. He believed that he was a prophet of God
                    and that he spoke directly to God. Phil Taylor, our DCM, very accurately said,
                    “This guy's in transmit 99 percent of the time,” and he was. When I interviewed
                    him you could see that he wasn't really listening to what I had to say. He was
                    merely waiting til I got done so he could say what he had to say, and while I
                    was talking he was thinking about what he was going to say. He wasn't taking
                    anything in. He surrounded himself with yes-men, but he ran a very, very good
                    political campaign in 1990. In September of that year he had perhaps two percent
                    of the vote in the polls, and they were pretty accurate polls. Then the Court of
                    Constiutionality ruled that Rios Montt could not run. From that day on the
                    people drifted off the Rios Montt bandwagon and got on Jorge Sorrano's. He got
                    some money, and he went on television with some very clever ads with attractive
                    jingles. He said the right things. He did the right things. He hired Roger Ailes
                    from the United States as a political expert to come down and advise him. From
                    two percent in early September of 1990 he got to 24 percent in the elections
                    held in November. Jorge Carpio got to 26 percent, and the other parties didn't
                    reach double digits. One of the brighter stars in the firmament of Guatemalan
                    politics is a young former mayor of Guatemala City by the name of Alvaro Artu.
                    He had a party called the PAN, and they came in third. The Democrat Christians,
                    because of their corruption, came in a poor fourth, and Cabrera was out of
                    it.</p>
                <p>Guatemalan law requires that you can't just win the presidency with plurality,
                    you have to win with a majority. So there was a run off between Serrano and
                    Jorge Carpio. Carpio having had 26 percent of the vote, Serrano 24 percent of
                    the vote. And the thought was that they might split that difference; no one
                    really knew what was going to happen. But again, Serrano campaigned very well,
                    and Jorge Carpio campaigned very badly. He proceeded to attack Alvaro Artu,
                    saying that Artu had made a corrupt deal with Serrano to support him as Foreign
                    Minister if Serrano won. It was true, but saying it publicly and nastily,
                    somehow he didn't do that right. There's a right way and a wrong way, and he
                    picked the wrong way. Carpio hardly improved his vote at all. He went from 26 to
                    28 percent of the total vote. He only picked up two percentage points. All the
                    rest of them, unanimously, went for Serrano who was elected by a large
                    plurality.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it was 72 percent?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: Approximately. Then subsequently Alvaro Artu became the Foreign Minister
                    in the new Serrano cabinet. So Jorge Carpio wasn't wrong in his accusations.
                    Nevertheless, the whole campaign, which was beginning to heat up by the time I
                    got there in October in 1989, got very warm all year long. The threat and
                    counter-threat of “there's going to be a coup, the army's going to take over and
                    not have elections, Cerezo is going to resign and turn things over to Cabrera,
                    Rios Montt is going to mount a coup, the army is going to support Rios Montt”—I
                    mean, pick your daily rumor, and it would sweep the capital city. Since most
                    politics in small Central American countries are controlled in the capital, what
                    happens in a small group in the capital is much more important than what happens
                    inside the beltway in Washington. In Washington inside the beltway, you can
                    influence each other, but the huge mass of the country isn't that effected. In
                    Guatemala, what happens inside their proverbial beltway does indeed affect how
                    the country goes. The country is primitive enough, and the society is fractured
                    enough, with half the population being Indian and not really in the political
                    culture. What happens in the capital has tremendous influence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the turn out like in terms of registered
                        voters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: It was about 65 percent in both cases.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you know what percentage of person who would be
                        eligible to vote, had they registered, were registered?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: No. One of the problems in a Latin American country, particularly in one
                    like Guatemala, which is so poor, is that they haven't had a reliable census
                    ever. You are really guessing at how many people. I think there are more than
                    ten million people living in that country, but I still see figures that say
                    eight and a half to nine million. I think they're guessing at the population of
                    Guatemala City. I believe it to be an excess of two million, but they're not
                    quite officially showing it to be two million yet, so it's very difficult to
                    tell. Of course the country has a huge rate of illiteracy, so people vote with
                    their thumbprints when they can't spell. The Democrat Christians, have a well
                    organized organization in the countryside, and they literally truck the
                    Guatemalan Indians into town and march them up to the polls where they put their
                    thumbprint where they are told. Nevertheless, the election was legal. It was
                    clean. It was open. We had a lot of investigators, international and American
                    observers, down there during the election, and all agreed on this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the head of the observer team, do you recall?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>STROOCK: Well, there were many different ones. The UN had one. We had one.
                    President Carter was down there. So it was hard to say, but there were several
                    of them. I guess the UN would have been the principle one. It was headed by a
                    man by the name of Tomuchat. But I went around all the country on both election
                    days, up and down the countryside, and I'm convinced that they were open, clean
                    elections; that there was no fraud, either time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think voters were coerced?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: Well, I think that it was a cleaner election in that regard than you
                    have for Sweetwater County Sheriff in Wyoming. It's the same kind of coercion as
                    “Bring your friends into town on the truck and you all vote.” In any event we
                    did have a clean election, and I flatter myself that much of what we did in the
                    embassy; the constant talking and prodding and visiting the army and saying,
                    “you can't do that,” the visiting with the various political figures and saying,
                    “You have got to do this right.” I saw Rios Montt twice. I became a very good
                    friend of his vice presidential candidate, a man by the name of Harris Whitbick
                    who again had dual U.S.-Guatemalan citizenship Several of the major figures in
                    Guatemala society have dual citizenship. Harris had been in the United States
                    Marine Corps, liked to play tennis and was a good friend. I would say, “Harris,
                    as a leader in this culture there are things you really must do. You will lose
                    more than you will gain unless you run a clean election.” I really spent about a
                    quarter of my time from October of 1989-January of 1991 trying to promote a
                    legitimate election.</p>
                <p>Although we were accused of it, definitely we had no preferred candidate. That
                    was the other thing: we were accused because I got early on to be a personal
                    friend of Jorge Carpio. I thought he was a very educated, erudite, interesting
                    man.</p>
                <p>Marta and I got to be social friends of Jorge and his wife Marita. They would
                    invite us to their home in Antigua, and we would have them over for small
                    dinners—as personal friends—at the embassy. And because of that, it was assumed
                    that, certainly Serrano assumed, that I was supporting Carpio. But we never did,
                    and never could. We refused to take sides publicly or privately. I would tell
                    Jorge privately, “Jorge, you're my good friend and I hope you always are my good
                    friend, but you're gonna be my good friend whether you stay as editor of El
                    Grafico or whether you're president of your country. That's the way it's gonna
                    be.” Also, I got to be very, very impressed with Alvaro Artu, and I made a point
                    of meeting personally with all the candidates at any time that I could, refusing
                    to have my picture taken with them publicly (which they all wanted), because I
                    didn't want the United States to get involved in the decision of the election.
                    But we were very heavily involved in the mechanics of the election.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>One of the things we did was support the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, which was
                    run by a wonderful man by the name of Arturo Herbrugger who is today the Vice
                    President of Guatemala. He's 81 years old. He's a distinguished jurist. He's one
                    of the leading jurists in Central America, and he's one of the few uncorrupt
                    members of the Latin American judiciary I've ever met. A wonderful man of whom
                    I'm very fond. He ran the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, and we said, “Look, what
                    do you need to run an honest election in terms of computer capability, in terms
                    of FAX machines, in terms of communication, because if we can use computers,
                    where communication is instantaneous, it will tremendously cut down the ability
                    to manipulate the election.” We must have spent well over 300,000 dollars of our
                    AID funds with the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, on this program. It was one of
                    the few programs where I would not insist on having matching funds because the
                    Supreme Electoral Tribunal had no funds to match. As we get into development
                    I'll talk about the matching funds concept. But this was just an outright grant
                    of US AID money to the Supreme Electoral Tribunal to equip them, to have safe
                    and secure transmission of results, instantaneous communication, and safe and
                    secure computation results. Because of that the election was very well run in a
                    country where elections had not been very well run previously. The AID mission
                    that coordinated this was run first by Tony Cauterucci and then by Terry Brown.
                    They both did an excellent job. I really think that was one place where the
                    American taxpayer got a very good run for his less than half a million
                    bucks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was democracy still a major issue after Serrano took
                        office or was that really the end?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: No, no, no. It's always going to be a major issue. In fact Serrano fell
                    off the wagon after I left. I left in November of 1992, and in May of 1993,
                    Jorge Serrano tried to turn himself into a dictator. He tried to abolish the
                    courts, abolish the congress, and muffle press. He tried that twice before
                    during my stay there. He would convince himself that anyone who opposed his
                    programs was in the pay of a drug lord, was a narco-trafficker, trying to
                    destabilize his government and had bought off and bribed the TV and newspapers.
                    He was a great believer in the conspiracy theory and believed that just about
                    everything was a conspiracy against him. The newspapers would attack him in
                    cartoons, or when they would publish that his family had taken up buying polo
                    ponies and playing polo, or that he had purchased a (finca) and was trying to
                    throw some poor Indians off the (finca) land in Rio Dulce. All of this was true,
                    but he took these as personal assaults and personal attacks on him—the
                    equivalent of lese majeste—trying to destabilize his state.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>I sent our defense attach� to see the Army Chief of Staff, Tromciso Orvega, who
                    was his good friend, to say that this can never work. I went down to the police
                    myself to say, “If you proceed to continue to terrorize the newspaper editors
                    [which he was doing], and if you abolish the congress— “If you do that,” I said,
                    “you will make my life a lot easier. I will become the world's greatest senior
                    tennis player because there will be nothing for me to do except to go out on
                    that tennis court I've got in back of the embassy and practice so that when I go
                    back to Wyoming I'll be the senior's tennis champ. I can promise you that every
                    single program and every single communication between you and the government of
                    United States will be cut.” I think, truly, that this was one of the key factors
                    in delaying in his decision until after I left. A few times he really listened
                    to me because I really got in his face. But not very often.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you think you talked him out of turning himself into a
                        dictator?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: I don't know that I myself was responsible. There were several other
                    factors. The time wasn't right for other reasons, too. I think one of the
                    reasons that he did make the attempt in May 1993 was that there was no American
                    ambassador there. We had an extremely able deputy chief of mission. The DCM was
                    John Keene, who couldn't be a more able man, a better officer, who some day
                    surely will be an ambassador. He got an award for his handling of affairs during
                    those difficult days, but he couldn't go down and pound on the table the way a
                    Chief of Mission could. I used to pound it literally, pound my hand on the side
                    of the chair of the visitation office of Serrano. He didn't like it: he really
                    didn't like me. In private, he called me “Cowboy that Ambassador.” I did not
                    have the same nice, warm personal relationship with Serrano that I had with
                    Cerezo. Serrano was a tougher character. I think Serrano started out wanting to
                    do the right things, and we had great hopes for him the first six months. But he
                    interpreted everything that was in the least bit critical as being
                    destabilizing, and we were constantly being critical. Constructively critical,
                    but—still—critical. And he didn't have the ability to laugh. I mean when Cerezo
                    and I got done beating up on each other, we'd go play tennis. When Serrano and I
                    got done talking, he would stomp off with the steam coming from around his
                    collar. It was a totally different personality mix.</p>
                <p>As I say, Serrano was an extremely complex character. There was so much that was
                    good about him, and there was so much that was bad about him. The corruption was
                    bad, but his abilities to engineer and organize were good. Cerezo was controlled
                    by the army. The Defense Minister—Alejandro Gramajo—would come over to the
                    palace and was able to move Cerezo around. The army never dared tell Serrano
                    what to do. In fact, he told the army. He grabbed a hold of it, was its
                    Commander in Chief and the infractions they committed while he was President, he
                    knew about. He either approved of them or at least didn't object to them. Two
                    totally different sets of personalities.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>There was constant worry on our part about this guy who is an autocrat. He
                    literally would tell me, “I spoke to the Lord,” and I had an answer for that,
                    but I never used it, I was always prepared to say, “Well, you know I speak to
                    the Lord, too, and He tells me something different than what he tells you,” but
                    I wasn't sure that would do it. Instead, I said, “Well, I spoke to Bernie
                    Aronson, and he isn't quite the Lord, but...” I tried that on him once. It's
                    difficult to make him laugh, but he did on that one.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Should we move on to Development now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: I suppose we'd better. You need to know, and those who deal with the
                    history of this period need to know, that democracy is only skin-deep in
                    Guatemala. It's not a real democracy, it's just a facade. It's a Potemkin
                    village. They have the president, the courts, and congress, but the corruption,
                    and the lack of support, and the fact that there is no social contract down
                    there means that our concern about real democracy was truly justified, and our
                    continuing concern to make sure that it take some kind of root is really
                    justified. This was—and will continue to be—a big problem for our bilateral
                    relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's do move on to Development. Why don't you tell us
                        what the issue was in your mind? What it was you thought you could do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>STROOCK: Well, there were two ways to handle it. We had two programs. One was the
                    AID programs to try and help them get on their feet with our U.S. taxpayer
                    resources. The other was the trade program, the private effort, which was much
                    more effective, but much more difficult to handle. When I got down there, the
                    AID program the previous year, had spent almost 200 million dollars. The biggest
                    problem was that the Guatemalan government had not been taking in any money from
                    taxes. They were printing money and the inflation had grown to more than 20%
                    annually.. The quetzal, which was their unit of monetary exchange, had been
                    stable at one quetzal to the dollar exchange. When I got there it was 2.8
                    quetzals to the dollar, and it was heading north to three, of four, and then
                    five quetzals to the dollar. Inflation of 26, 27, almost 30 percent. A very
                    corrupt young man, Oscar Pineda, had become the Minister of Finance. The
                    extremely able president of the national bank, Frederico Linavas, had resigned,
                    and the new finance team had no grasp of what they were doing. They were in a
                    arrears to the World Bank, the price of coffee was falling, coffee being their
                    principal export, so the economy was in desperate shape. Because of cheating and
                    corruption, much of our AID money had been misused. The year before I got there,
                    we had given them so-called “Economic Support Funds, EST, which are direct
                    injections of U.S. taxpayer dollars, into the Bank of Guatemala in the amount of
                    80 million dollars. The quid pro quo for the 80 million dollars was that instead
                    of trying to control the currency, they would remove all currency controls,
                    which they did. So the 80 million dollars did accomplish convertibility and
                    opened up the economy, which was necessary. But instead of solving the country's
                    economic problems for two or three years, it didn't even solve them for two or
                    three months. The 80 million dollars were disbursed in August of '89. I got
                    there in October of '89 and it was almost as if, except for the convertibility
                    factor, this money had never been seen. So we immediately started to try and
                    change the way the economy was handled. We had a brilliant economist from
                    Georgia State University with AID mission by the name of Sam Skogsted. The
                    Economic Section of the embassy, which later on became extremely strong under
                    the very able leadership of one of the best economists, male or female, I ever
                    met, Geri Chester, wasn't all that strong before her arrival. It was the weakest
                    of the agencies that we had down there. So I depended on Skogsted and his
                    economic team from AID to help with the private sector.</p>
                <p>We were trying to get the government to privatize many of the agencies which were
                    so fat and bloated. They refused to privatize the telephone monopoly, (Guatel),
                    because it made so much money for the government. They had already privatized
                    the national airline, Aviatecu, the year before I got there, but they'd done it
                    in an extremely dirty and crooked way. Interestingly enough the president and
                    the lady who was his personal secretary, and who quite frankly lived with him,
                    Claudia Arenas, were the largest stockholders. They also were on the board of
                    directors. It was that kind of an operation.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>We tried to set out an economic program that they could follow. We insisted that
                    we wouldn't put up any more Economic Support Funds unless they did follow that
                    economic program. AID had 50 million dollars of economic support funds allocated
                    for Guatemala, in January or February of 1990. We didn't actually disburse any
                    of it, because we were negotiating the treaty under which it would be spent,
                    until September of 1990 in the middle of the presidential political campaign.
                    Then we only released 20 million dollars of it, directly into Guatemala's
                    account at the World Bank. Further, we made it a requirement that they would
                    take certain actions set out in a Memorandum of Understanding that we negotiated
                    in order to get the balance of 30 million dollars. They never took those steps
                    so we kept the 30 million dollars they didn't earn and held it over for dealing
                    with the next administration.</p>
                <p>We were trying to get them to do what was necessary to curb inflation, to stop
                    printing money, to privatize their government agencies, and to open up the
                    economy so that at least the “trickle down theory” of economics that they
                    believed in would work. The problem in Guatemala is that when they do run their
                    economy and run it right, they don't allow the workers to get any of it. Their
                    minimum wages are not enforced. The private sector says they're going to pay
                    minimum wage, but they rarely do. The social security system doesn't work. The
                    public health system doesn't work. I paint a very black picture because the
                    picture is black. The economy is good for maybe 10 percent of the Guatemalan
                    population. It's excellent for one percent. It's okay for maybe another ten
                    percent, and then 79 to 80 percent of the people live in constant and abject
                    misery. The benefits of an open economy aren't getting down to them because the
                    economy isn't open below a certain social and economic status. We were
                    constantly working on that. I think, along with the guerrilla war, this is the
                    long most important range problem of Guatemala. The people who control the
                    economy will not allow even the “trickle down” theory to work. There is no
                    social justice in Guatemala today—that is the sad truth.</p>

                <p>STROOCK: Well this was in the area of AID, and that's another problem altogether.

                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: No, it's all right. Let's talk about it. The other component in
                    developing a country is to try and develop the social system and, most
                    importantly the educational system. We tried to promote contacts, scholarship
                    programs that bring Guatemalan students to the United States, and Americans to
                    Guatemala, Fulbright scholars and that kind of thing. The Peace Corps is great.
                    We need to talk about the Peace Corps as a separate matter altogether. Remind me
                    to talk about the Peace Corps because I think it's very important.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>When I got down there, we had a program of a hundred and twenty million dollars
                    in what they call DA, Direct Aid, for specific programs: bilingual education,
                    immunization of children, nourishment of mothers, women's health care and road
                    construction for farm to market roads. What I found we were doing, to my utter
                    horror, was: when the program was approved in Washington, we would hire a
                    contractor, and put up the money in advance, letting the contractor draw against
                    it. Well you can imagine how much went into roads and how much went into
                    education and how much went into health care and how much went into somebody's
                    pocket. I found that in a sixteen million dollar program in health care, over a
                    million dollars was unaccounted for. The AID inspector general just couldn't
                    account for it. This was probably the most difficult decision for me as
                    Ambassador. The sixteen million dollar program was one for immunization of
                    children and in that society, children not immunized against the simplest germs,
                    such as measles, mumps, chicken pox, anything. The disease just takes them off
                    because they're not properly nourished. I had to decide whether or not I was
                    going to shut that 16 million program down because the Guatemalan health
                    department had stolen a million dollars of it. I got advice that I would be
                    responsible for the deaths of many, many children. I decided that yes, I would,
                    but unless somebody made a stand some place they'd likely run out and at least
                    half of what was left of the sixteen million bucks. So I shut the program down.
                    I had to fight the bureaucracy up and down to do it. It was amazing, when the
                    government there saw that we weren't kidding—it took about 90 days to convince
                    them that there was going to be no more money and that program was going down
                    the tubes—the corrupt Minister of Health (and he really was corrupt), named
                    Doctor Gellart Matas, began a real rain dance. He was a friend of the Ambassador
                    of the Order Knights of Malta. Gellart Matas had the Ambassador set up a dinner
                    to which I came, and there he made this plea to me. The Ambassador of the
                    Knights of Malta, who was really my friend, said, “Pancho, I appreciate this
                    dinner and I appreciate Dr. Matas being here, but the fact of the matter is that
                    American taxpayer money was stolen and until it's replaced, the American
                    taxpayer has no business supporting this program. If a lot of children die, it's
                    not the fault of the American taxpayer, it's the fault of the people who stole
                    their money. I think both you and the Minister had better understand that.” And
                    he backed off a mile, and Gellart Matas was finally convinced we were serious.
                    We finally got three people thrown in jail. We got half the money back, finally,
                    and we reinstated the program a year later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just for the record, what was the name of the ambassador
                        of the Knights of Malta?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: Pancho Balzaretti, Francisco Balzaretti. He's still there. He's a
                    wonderful friend and a good guy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you got three people put in jail...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>STROOCK: We got three people put away and got half the money back, we reinstated
                    the program. But in the course of doing all of this, I called on some of my very
                    firm memories of days in the Wyoming State Senate. I remembered how federal
                    funds were being sent to Wyoming to be spent on road programs. The federal
                    highways, the big four-lane highways, are built on a program that is 10 percent
                    state money and 90 percent federal money. The state Highway Department hardly
                    gives a damn about those highways. They send out an inspector occasionally to
                    look at it, but it's the Federal Bureau of Roads that builds them and worries
                    about them and essentially maintains them. The State Highway Department looks
                    after them, but most of the money comes from the feds, so it is not their main
                    focus.</p>
                <p>The main focus is on any program where the State Highway Department spends all
                    its money or at least pays 50 percent of the cost. I'm thinking of market roads,
                    industrial development roads, and roads like that, where the state has to come
                    up with at least 50 percent of the money. And there the state engineers are out
                    there examining that the money is being properly spent, because now they've got
                    real “skin” in the deal.</p>
                <p>Human nature is the same world-wide, and if the Guatemalans had 50 percent of
                    their own dough in the deal, then they're going to pay attention. I think this
                    served as a screen as well. A lot of programs we had promoted in the past in
                    Guatemala were our own great ideas, but they weren't what the Guatemalans really
                    thought was so great. As long as we were going to give it to them, why not take
                    it? But by the time I left, we had quit advancing money. We had only put up our
                    AID money after the Guatemalans had put theirs up. And we did it on a 50 percent
                    matching basis in every single program. The few exceptions were the specific
                    ones already mentioned, and another one which funded the Human Rights
                    Ombudsman's office so that it had agencies in all 23 provinces. Also, the Peace
                    Corps volunteers—we put up a fund of 250 Thousand Dollars. The volunteers could
                    come in and—up to a maximum of 5 thousand dollars—get a program going. But even
                    those were matched because while the five thousand dollars bought the materials
                    for the school house, it was the villagers who built the school. While the five
                    thousand dollars bought the plastic pipe for the potable water system, it was
                    the villagers who dug the ditches and put the pipe together and dug the
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they matched with their labor your funds.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: Yes, but I'm talking about actual fund matching because that was another
                    argument we had. The Guatemalans said, “Well, we'll match it with rent space and
                    with effort.” I said, “No, that's been done in the past, and it doesn't work,
                    it's not the same. Its got to be dollars.” And I think whoever runs this program
                    that we're talking about, will want to talk to Terry Brown our AID Mission
                    Director and get his vision on it because Terry is the one who really carried it
                    to fruition.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: I know it worked. I know it worked. It made our aid much more efficient.
                    You could see the efficiency growing in front of your eyes, you could see many
                    more miles of road for our dollar, you could see the roads were better
                    maintained, you could see that the schools were better built, you could see that
                    the schools which we had built with a hundred percent of our dough, weren't
                    properly cared for. They were falling down and dirty and messy and looked
                    generally neglected. Once those local people had half their dough in it, man,
                    they looked spick and span and were great.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there less corruption? Less money...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: I hope so. I don't know. Once you turn the money over to the people,
                    you're at their mercy. WE certainly scared a lot of people with our actions on
                    the health thing. I mean that reverberated around the country. I'd like to think
                    so. I can tell you that I saw the change that we got more bang for our buck, but
                    I didn't see whether or not we had curbed the corruption.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said before that there was something you wanted to
                        mention about the Peace Corps. Was it about that 250 thousand dollar fund
                        or...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: Well, that's the part that leads me into the Peace Corps. I think the
                    best thing that we do in terms of our people to people relationship, in terms of
                    being good neighbors, is the Peace Corps. Certainly in Guatemala. The Peace
                    Corps got out to small teeny rural villages that would never see an American.
                    Guatemalans were used to seeing Americans who are diplomats and visit in big
                    cars or helicopters, or ministers or preachers, who evangelize a certain belief.
                    They see either diplomats or religious types or rich tourists who dress funny
                    and travel in big tourist buses. But they don't see the real people of the
                    United States who make up the head and heart of our country. The Peace Corps
                    volunteers live in the villages just the way the villagers do and get to know
                    them and have a little bit of money to promote a local project and make people's
                    lives a little bit better. When the Peace Corps guy or gal leaves the villagers
                    may forget the particular lesson of how to plant trees, or they may not plant
                    anymore trees. They may not remember all the health instructions that the nurse
                    gave, or the water system may break and they may not remember how to fix it. But
                    as long as they live they'll remember that a young (or in some cases old),
                    American came and lived with them and shared their lives, and did it for no
                    other reason than to make the lives of those villagers better. And you're never
                    going to get anti- Americanism in a generation who has been exposed to these
                    kinds of Americans. That's the best thing we do overseas.</p>

                <p>STROOCK: Of the embassy, which was over-staffed. We reduced the staff of the
                    embassy substantially. And I think that there are many more places in that
                    embassy and many other embassies where the staff can be reduced in size. I don't
                    think that we have in the past used proper business management in running
                    embassies, but one place that we should not cut, one place where we get much
                    more than we give is in the Peace Corps program.</p>

                <p>STROOCK: Yes, it does. Before I got there there had been the murder of twelve
                    university students which had happened in August of 1989. There's a pretty well
                    accepted statistic that well over 120,000 people have been murdered by both
                    sides in the 32 year long guerrilla war. I am personally convinced that about 25
                    percent of those murders and atrocities were committed by the guerrillas and
                    their supporters, and about 75 percent of those murders and atrocities were
                    committed by the army and their supporters. There's an organization called the
                    “Patrulleros Civiles,” which the army has set up in each village. They are
                    taking a lesson out of Mao Zedong's book; that he who controls the sea controls
                    the fishing. The Patrulleros have been set up to make sure that guerrilla groups
                    don't move in and out of these small villages. They have ended up in too many
                    instances, tyrannizing and terrorizing these villages. By now they pretty much
                    control them.</p>
                <p>The army is the most important figure in the rural areas of the country—95
                    percent of it—for a very simple reason. If you are the mayor of a little village
                    up in the boondocks, or down in the jungle, and you want a road, or you want a
                    well, or you want potable water, or you want a community building built, you can
                    write and petition and budget and go down to the capital, which is where
                    everything has to be done. The government operates on an extremely centralized
                    system—you can't even get an automobile license outside of one building in the
                    capital. Well, as mayor, you can write and do all, but you'll never get what you
                    need, because the money isn't there, and the ability isn't there. But if you go
                    down the road to the local army barracks, and talk to the captain, or the
                    lieutenant in charge, he'll send a group of troops out and they'll dig the well,
                    or they'll build the school, or they'll build the road. That's where the army
                    gets its strength and support. They are the only effective force of any kind,
                    for good or evil, that represents government out in the country. And, of course,
                    they take advantage of it. They steal and rob and commit atrocities, and anybody
                    who speaks out against them is going to disappear.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>There is no social contract as we understand it out in the back country.
                    Furthermore, half the population of Guatemala is “indigena”—direct descents of
                    the Mayan Indians the conquistadores encountered. They speak 23 separate
                    different and distinct languages. Not dialects, distinct languages. So one tribe
                    doesn't understand the other. They're separated by their language, they're not
                    united. Perhaps half of them know how to speak Spanish, which is the official
                    language of the country. So at least 25 percent of the population doesn't speak
                    Spanish at all, just their native languages. They're people who don't read. They
                    vote with their thumb; they sign contracts with their thumb print.</p>
                <p>The land distribution system of the country is totally skewed. There are families
                    trying to make a living on a plot of land no bigger than this conference table.
                    As each family has more children the land will get divided further. There's no
                    primogeniture in Guatemala. When someone dies, and he has a plot of land as big
                    as this room, it gets divided up five ways if there are five living children,
                    and there generally are at least that many. That's another problem that we
                    haven't time to touch on in this conversation, but population control is
                    absolutely essential to the future of Latin American countries, and of Guatemala
                    in particular. If the economy grows at 3 percent annually, that would be
                    marvelous. But the population grows at more than 3 percent, so you're working
                    like hell to fall further and further behind on a per basis. The misery index
                    just keeps going up</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you as the Ambassador try to do about this human
                        rights?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: When I first got to the Department, and read the cables, it became
                    obvious to me that State was apologizing for the human rights atrocities that
                    had been committed for years. We were so concerned that the Soviet Union would
                    extend its influence in Latin America that we accepted the atrocities committed
                    by the rich oligarchs who controlled the economy, and the army who controlled
                    the rural countryside, and the corrupt governments who controlled the city
                    streets. We accepted corruption and atrocities as the price we had to pay to
                    make sure that the country didn't fall into the hands of the Soviet Union, or
                    that the Soviet Union wasn't able to make a Cuban-type base for ballistic
                    missiles aimed at us. It was a legitimate concern, and one which drove our
                    policy in Latin America for years, including the first two months that I got to
                    Guatemala.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>But there was a sea change in November and December of 1989: an amalgam of
                    Gorbachev, perestroika, glasnost, the fall of the Berlin wall, and the
                    fracturing of Eastern Europe. We saw the disappearance of the Soviet Union. Now
                    there was no reason to tolerate human rights violations by anybody, but
                    certainly not by the army. There was no longer any communist threat for them to
                    protect us against. If there ever had been a communist threat, there certainly
                    wasn't one now. That whole perception that existed in Washington for so many
                    years that we had to worry about leftist infiltration and takeover in Latin
                    America diminished considerably. It wasn't gone by the time I left, and I dare
                    say it isn't gone as we sit here and talk today. And yet, the reality is that,
                    in fact, it is gone, and American policy in Latin America and Central America
                    has to realize that it's gone. There is no excuse anymore for us to tolerate the
                    human rights violations we thought we had to tolerate in the past, particularly
                    in view of our own heritage of freedom and independence.</p>
                <p>I went down there with the belief that we had been much too accepting of human
                    rights violations in the past, that it was not in our national character,
                    heritage or interest to continue to accept it. And yet, I couldn't be a
                    do-gooder and ignore the fact that one had to work with what you had there, the
                    agencies that were functioning. The fact that the economy was controlled by the
                    few wealthy, you had to work with that. You couldn't destroy the economy because
                    you didn't like that. Despite the fact that the army had contributed to 75
                    percent of the atrocities, you had to work with the army. You had to try and
                    persuade all these people that things had to change.</p>
                <p>So I tried with the Cerezo administration, particularly after the fall of the
                    Berlin wall which was a dramatic event that was really noticed all over Latin
                    America. Perestroika and the glasnost hadn't affected them as much, but the
                    dramatic visuals that were carried all over the world by TV On the fall of the
                    wall made a big impression. That's a new factor in our policy now; instant
                    television communication and the fact that CNN is available in every little
                    village in the world. I kept asking; let's find the people who murdered the
                    students (it was undoubtedly the army), and make an example of them. Doing
                    justice would raise the army's estimation in the rest of the world, I said. I
                    tried that on Gramajo, the Defense Minister I don't know how many times. Senator
                    Dodd and Senator Warner came down and spent the night, and we took Gramajo out
                    to dinner. They each individually took it up with him, to no avail.</p>
                <p>A month after I got there we had the case of a young nun, Sister Diana Ortiz.
                    Something terrible had happened to her. When I finally saw her after she had
                    been kidnaped for 48 hours, she had been seriously beaten. But her story just
                    didn't hang together. What she said happened to her, just couldn't have happened
                    to her. Nevertheless, something had happened to her, and we were trying to get
                    the Guatemalan officials to cooperate with us. They refused.</p>
                <p>It was frustrating as hell because I knew that the fact that an American nun was
                    kidnaped, beaten and possibly, but not probably, raped and tortured was bound to
                    appeal, and did in fact appeal to American television, American newspapers, and
                    upset the Catholic church.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>Many, many Catholic bishops and priests accepted her story at face value. Who
                    wouldn't, if you didn't know that what she said happened to her, couldn't have
                    happened to her. But something bad did happen to her, and today we still don't
                    know what that was. As I sit here talking to you, I don't know what it was that
                    actually happened. I just know that for whatever reasons, she lied to us, tried
                    to implicate the embassy in the affair and refused to cooperate with our efforts
                    in any way. That story hit the headlines and we were getting stonewalled by the
                    Guatemalans. Every day you'd pick up the papers, read about another murder.
                    There were street children being tortured. A street child was kicked to death.
                    There are about 5,000—probably 10,000 now—children who live on the street every
                    night in Guatemala City, abandoned by their families. Of course, they're not
                    little boy scouts and girl scouts. They're 10 year old prostitutes, and 9 year
                    old thieves—and that kind of thing. But you don't murder and torture them. There
                    were pictures of three street boys who had been tortured. I'm convinced security
                    forces, maybe not army, maybe the police, did it. Their tongues were cut out,
                    their noses were cut off, their fingers were burned. I mean torturing children;
                    it was truly terrible. Something I didn't think people of the United States
                    could possibly condone. We tried to get the police to come forward as to what
                    happened, and to investigate. Unfortunately, the courts were hand in glove with
                    the police on this, so nothing happened. I got there in October. By February of
                    1990, I had my belly full. I'd spoken to the president, we had monthly
                    breakfasts, so we'd had four monthly breakfasts in which we'd discussed all of
                    these things. I'd made at least two special trips down to see the Ministry of
                    the Interior. I don't know how many times I've gone by the Defense Ministry with
                    the Defense Attach�, Colonel Cornell, to discuss them. We were getting nowhere.
                    They knew that the American Ambassador was going to leave in three or four
                    years. Their plan was to stiff him and pat him on the head. In time he would go
                    away, and things would continue in their natural course.</p>
                <p>I was scheduled to make a speech to the Rotary Club, which is the biggest
                    gathering with businessmen in the country. I got ahold of the Public Affairs
                    Officer, John Tracy; a marvelous Irishman, a great friend of mine and an
                    excellent PAO. I said, “I want to make a speech. I want to make it as friendly
                    as possible under the circumstances, but as firm as a rock about human rights.”
                    That's what it was. There was a phrase in there that said, “The United States
                    cannot long have productive relations with a country that either promotes, or
                    tolerates, human rights abuses of its own citizens because that is not in the
                    tradition of the American people.” Well, that created quite a sensation. The
                    press asked Vinicio Cerezo, the President, about it, and he said, “Well, I know
                    Tom. He's kind of a cowboy, and these are just his personal opinions, I'm sure
                    they don't reflect the opinions of the United States government.”</p>
                <p>So, for the first time, I really pulled in whatever chips I had. I called Bernie
                    Aronson in the State Department, and I said, “You guys have got to support me.”
                    I give Bernie a great deal of credit for a lot of things; but certainly on this
                    one. He backed me up 100 percent.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>He was mad at me, “Damn it, why didn't you send up the speech for me to read
                    before you gave it?” “Bernie, I did.” What we'd done, John and I, was to write
                    the speech in Spanish. We'd sent it up in Spanish because it was going to be
                    given in Spanish. What neither of us knew, and I didn't realize until quite a
                    bit later, was that Bernie didn't speak Spanish. He saw it but he didn't read
                    it, or have it translated. Because it was in Spanish he just skipped it. From
                    then on out, of course, I cabled everything I was going to say in English as
                    well as Spanish.</p>
                <p>Regardless of the fact that he was upset about that, Bernie backed me up 100
                    percent. He said, “What we'll do is we'll bring you home. We'll recall you as a
                    sign of our displeasure with the president's statement.”</p>
                <p>When I got back to Washington, I thought to myself; just being recalled and
                    coming back, that's not dramatic enough. I need something dramatic. I need a
                    letter signed by the President of the United States saying that Ambassador
                    Stroock does indeed speak for this administration. To get a letter signed by the
                    President through the fudge factory down at Foggy Bottom, is not going to happen
                    in a week. I wanted to get back to Guatemala in a week while this thing was
                    still hot.</p>
                <p>Joe Sullivan, who was the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Central America was in
                    favor of doing it. Bernie Aronson was in favor of doing it. You have to
                    understand that Guatemala was not large on their radar screen—they had a few
                    other problems. It was essentially turned over to me. “If you can get a letter,
                    hurray.”</p>
                <p>The first thing I did was get ahold of Margaret Tutwiler who had worked on the
                    Bush campaign as Jim Baker's secretary. She was now the Assistant Secretary for
                    Public Affairs. I got an appointment with her and asked Margaret to get me an
                    appointment with Jim Baker so I could get my letter. Then I worked with the
                    Guatemala desk officer, a brilliant girl by the name of Debbie McCarthy. She ran
                    around the Legal Department and I got input from anybody she could. We worked up
                    a one-page letter in Spanish—with a good English translation this time—for the
                    President to sign. It said that indeed I did speak for the administration, and
                    while the President had every kind of admiration and respect for President
                    Cerezo, he really wanted him to know that human rights were an important
                    component of our relations. I have a copy of the letter. I forget all the
                    details but it was a good friendly, fair, but very firm letter.</p>
                <p>I was trying to get up to see Jim, and Bernie said, “You'll never get to see Jim
                    on this. He's flying around...” He had the Middle East, and Poland. I said, “Let
                    me try.” So I got ahold of Margaret, and we got ahold of Karen Davidson, Jim's
                    scheduling secretary and the next thing you know Baker said, “Yes, I'd like to
                    talk to Stroock. I want to talk to him about my ranch in Wyoming.” Jim looked at
                    and almost bought the Moose Willow, our place in Dubois, and he did buy a place
                    50-60 miles away. “I want to talk to him.” So I had an appointment at 11:00 on
                    the Thursday.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>In the meantime I had also contacted Chase Untermeyer, and Nancy Wong on the
                    staff in the White House. I wasn't getting anywhere to get in to see the
                    President. Suddenly I remembered that General Brent Scowcroft, who was the head
                    of the National Security Council was a good friend of Dick Cheney's. I had met
                    him through Dick and we had gotten along well at subsequent meetings. So I
                    called Kathy Enbody, Dick's secretary— she has been his secretary for years—and
                    got her to call Brent Scowcroft's secretary. Then I called Brent and said, “I
                    really, really need to talk to you.” So I had an appointment on Thursday with
                    Baker, and Friday with Scowcroft. The deal with Scowcroft was that he would take
                    me to see the President with this now famous letter. Saturday I would spend with
                    my sister Sandra and then Sunday I was going to fly back to Guatemala.</p>
                <p>Nobody in the State Department really thought that all this would hang together,
                    but I did persuade the ARA staff to help. Thursday morning Bernie Aronson said,
                    “If you're going to see Baker, I'd like to go with you.” I said, “Of course.” We
                    showed up in Baker's office at 11:00, and were marched right in. Jim wanted to
                    spend the whole time talking about his ranch near Boulder in Wyoming. He'd shot
                    an elk 400 feet away at his neighbor's ranch, at the Skinners. Of course I love
                    to talk about Wyoming too, and we exchanged fishing lies. Finally, we could tell
                    it was getting to the end of the time and he said, “Oh, about this Guatemala
                    thing, you've got a letter you want signed by the President?” I said, “Yes, Mr.
                    Secretary, I sure do,” and I explained to him why. He turned to Bernie and said,
                    “Bernie, what do you think?” Well, by this time Bernie has realized that Jim and
                    I go back a little ways. To be fair and to be truthful he was not as gung-ho as
                    I was. He would have sent me back to Guatemala with or without the letter. But
                    he said, “Yes, I've read it, it seems it's okay.” “Okay, then let's do it,”
                    replied Baker. And I said, “Mr. Secretary, I have an appointment over at the
                    White House to expedite this.” And he said, “I'd rather you go through channels,
                    but the letter is okay.”</p>
                <p>When we went out in the hall, I said to Bernie, “If we go through channels, I'm
                    never going to get this letter signed in time. I'm going to take this letter
                    over to Brent Scowcroft with me. Would you authorize it to be typed?” And he
                    did, bless his heart. So I had the letter typed in final form, the official
                    letter in English, and also the official translation in Spanish. Friday I
                    waltzed it over to the White House at about 10:30 in the morning. I waited for
                    about 50 minutes, and finally got in to see Brent Scowcroft, and of course, no
                    chit-chat there, just me and Brent Scowcroft.</p>
                <p>I told him my problem, and he read the letter and he said, “Bernie Aronson has
                    signed off on it?” I said, “Yes,” and I had the whole file, and I said, “I've
                    talked to Jim Baker about it too.” “Okay.” He said, “You better hurry.” So he
                    picked up the phone, and spoke to the President. Immediately, he walked me from
                    his office down two corridors into the Oval Office. You can hear that there is a
                    chopper warming up on the White House south lawn. That's how close it was. The
                    President was headed off at noon for some place—I think Camp David, I'm not
                    sure. We spent two or three minutes chatting—how are you? how is Marta? and how
                    are things going?</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>He was very flattering, “You're doing a wonderful job, and I hear there's a
                    problem? You've got a letter for me to sign?” And I said, “Yes, Mr. President,
                    here it is.”</p>
                <p>He said to Brent, “Is it okay if I sign this?” And Brent said, “Its been approved
                    by everybody in the State Department.” He looked at me and said, “This better
                    not be wrong,” and he put it up on the door jamb as he heads out the door,
                    signed George Bush, and handed it to me. Then he went out with his entourage,
                    got in the helicopter and lifts off. Very impressive: Marines
                    saluting—everything. I breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
                <p>That's how I got the letter. Then I took that letter back to Guatemala over the
                    weekend and arranged an appointment that Monday with the President at his
                    official office in the palace.</p>
                <p>The people in the embassy were really impressed with that letter. Until then,
                    they didn't know whether I was for real or not. We had our country team meeting
                    that morning. A lady that ran one of the missions in AID—ROCAP. It was the
                    regional AID mission that did regional things, mostly in the environment. This
                    gal was a real friend. Her name was Nadine Hogan, and she's a great politician,
                    a good friend of the Coors family who has been active in Denver politics,
                    Colorado politics and national politics for years.</p>
                <p>She has great political instincts, so I asked her, “How do you think I ought to
                    handle this thing?”</p>
                <p>She said, “You show that to everybody on your Country Team. They're all wondering
                    whether you're for real.” So we called them all in, 19 or 20 people, and I
                    showed the letter before I took it down to the palace to show the president.</p>
                <p>I said, “I've got this letter and this is the way we're going to go. We've got
                    Bernie Aronson and Jim Baker and the President behind us 100 percent.” That
                    letter, I think, was the pivotal point that changed the whole direction of the
                    way the embassy moved on Human Rights. It changed the way the Guatemalan
                    government perceived us. It also changed how the rest of Guatemalan society
                    perceived us. Because previous to that, talking about human rights violations
                    wasn't quite the right thing to do. After all, it meant that everybody knew you
                    were bad mouthing the security forces, and the army, and the government; because
                    they did most of it. It was considered maybe a little too pro-communist, and a
                    little too far to the left to do that.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>But once the American Ambassador came back with a letter from the President after
                    that speech, it was very obvious where the United States stood; and where the
                    United States stands is where most of Guatemalan society wants to be. From then
                    on out I really did begin to notice great change in the way the Guatemalans
                    approached human rights violations publicly, privately, and governmentally. The
                    army assaults on human rights, the official assaults on human rights
                    declined—markedly. There were other factors contributing, of course. One was the
                    fact that when Cerezo came to office, one of the good things he did was to open
                    up a dialogue with the guerrillas. The guerilla war is responsible for an awful
                    lot of these human rights violations. When you put a claymore mine in a road,
                    and someone walks on it, no matter whether the guerrilla placed the claymore
                    mine or the army did, whose ever leg gets blown off, that's a human rights
                    violation. That sort of thing diminished as the guerrillas and the army would
                    talk to each other. The people began to believe that there could be a peaceful
                    end to this guerrilla war. It hasn't happened yet—but they still have that
                    belief. There wasn't the intensity of trying to mutilate each other in the
                    guerrilla war. It got better—but it wasn't good.</p>
                <p>There were still violations. The guerrillas still came in and burned up hospitals
                    and kidnaped and threatened death to American missionaries. Perhaps the most
                    famous case that involved an American, was the Michael Devine case in June of
                    1990. An American named Michael Devine, who had been a Peace Corps volunteer,
                    and who lived up in the little town of Popgun, had a restaurant, a camp ground,
                    and a small ranch. He was accosted by five non-commissioned officers, directed
                    by at least a captain and probably a colonel in the Guatemalan army, and accused
                    of stealing, or trafficking in a Calil rifle that had been missing from the
                    local army base. He hadn't been. He had a Galil rifle all right, but he had
                    purchased it quite legally. He hadn't stolen it from the army base, and the army
                    knew better than that.</p>
                <p>But in the course of interrogating him, they killed him. The details as to
                    whether or not he got mad and they killed him, or whether they beat him up and
                    then killed him we aren't sure, but we had enough circumstantial evidence and
                    eye witnesses to know that these guys forced him out of his pickup truck, and
                    put him in their pickup truck. They took him into the Poptum army base, and
                    later his decapitated body was found beside the road at the gate of his ranch.
                    We know who did it. We know the vehicle it was done in.</p>
                <p>So I went to the then new Defense Minister, a wishy-washy, sneaky type named
                    General Bolanos, and tried to convince him if they would just bring the people
                    who did this to justice, that they would reflect on themselves. It could turn it
                    into something positive. Instead of causing great American distress, it would
                    cause great American support. At that time we were giving them something more
                    than $6 million in military aid each year. They were very worried that it had
                    gone down from $12 million the year before. I said, “I can promise you it's
                    going to go to nothing if you don't solve this, because the key thing here is
                    that no American taxpayer is going to want any penny of his money spent in an
                    army that murders an American citizen and then covers up the murder. That's just
                    not acceptable behavior.”</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>Again, it was still too soon—they hadn't really realized the sea change in our
                    human rights policies caused by all the events I've described. They didn't
                    really believe we would take action, so the army stonewalled us. They just flat
                    wouldn't cooperate. They really did cover up. The captain in command of the
                    murder squad was Hugo Contveras. He was known as Hugo, El Maldilo, Hugo the bad
                    guy, the evil one. There was a Captain, from the secret service who was involved
                    in covering up the crime. I forget the name of the colonel in the military
                    district of Santa Elena, who gave the order to “controlas.” In Spanish it means
                    control, and it also has the state of the art meaning of, that's okay to kill
                    him.</p>
                <p>We had it cold. We had the reports both from the Military Defense Attach� and
                    from the CIA station. They had gotten information out of the army. There were
                    enough dissenting army officers who were telling us, and we were sure of what we
                    had.</p>
                <p>So when they stiffed us, I got absolutely furious, and again I have nothing but
                    good things to say about my relationship with Bernie in this regard. I called
                    him and said, “I think we ought to cut off the military aid. These guys think
                    we're kidding.” It had taken me from June until October to get to this point. We
                    had several telephone calls and I even came back to Washington in November of
                    1990 for this. So the decision was made. We were now in the time period when the
                    first election of 1990 had been held, and 26 percent of the vote went Jorge
                    Carpio, and 24 percent of the vote went for Serrano, with all the rest splitting
                    up the difference. So there was going to have to be run-off election in December
                    or January.</p>
                <p>We knew that Serrano now had an excellent chance of being president. We knew that
                    he would not want the fact that we had cut off military aid to happen on his
                    watch. He would want it to happen on the Cerezo watch because it was Cerezo's
                    refusal to interfere with the army that caused the problem. Cerezo had been
                    scared by two previous coup attempts. So it was decided that we would cut off
                    military aid just as quickly as we could get it done, which turned out to be the
                    first week of December 1990.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think we missed just the last half of the last
                        sentence.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STROOCK: Well, the decision to cut off military aid in December, still while on
                    the Cerezo watch, and still while Bolanos was Minister of Defense, caused a true
                    sensation and much consternation. They didn't believe we were going to do it,
                    even though I warned them it was coming several times. The official announcement
                    came from Washington D.C. out of the Defense Department. I had had to talk to
                    Dick Cheney about that, which was fun to do because he doesn't generally get
                    mixed up in $6 million deals in Guatemala, but I did get through and talk to
                    him. Dick has always been more than kind, and more than helpful, and more than
                    generous with me.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>So we cut off the military aid, and you know, that was a thunder clap. From then
                    on out, we got verbal assurances that they were working on it. And we eventually
                    got the five poor sons of bitches, the privates who did it, 30 years in jail.
                    But we never were able to get the colonel in Santa Elena who I think was the
                    intellectual author of it. Someday I'm going to write a book about the twists
                    and turns of the legalities of how we finally got Captain Hugo Contravas before
                    a court, and caught him in several lies. The court finally condemned him to 18
                    years, and he went to jail. But guess what? The first night he was in jail he
                    escaped. Isn't that miraculous? In a military jail? And he still hasn't been
                    caught. But the very fact that he was convicted, that we pushed it, and that we
                    still have not returned to military aid for the Guatemalan army was pretty
                    impressive.</p>
                <p>When I talk about military aid you have to understand that there are all kinds of
                    games played with military aid. We froze the official, authorized, up-front,
                    everybody sees it, and its accounted for military aid. There was about $10
                    million worth of military aid in the pipeline from previous authorizations that
                    had been agreed upon, trucks, boots, Quonset huts, medical supplies, ambulances,
                    that kind of thing—that we stopped. So we really froze about $16 million worth
                    of aid. Once the privates were in prison, then—as evidence of good faith—and as
                    evidence that we wouldn't just beat them with a stick, we determined to release
                    about half the military aid that was in the pipeline. Then, once Contravas was
                    convicted—even though he “escaped”—we gave them some more military aid. We still
                    had about $6 million frozen when Serrano came to me and said, “Look, I'm having
                    terrible problems with the military. I'm going to appoint a new Defense
                    Minister, I'm going to get rid of General Mendoza who says he is helping me, but
                    really is not. I'm going to put in a general named Garcia Samayoa. When I do
                    that I want you to turn loose the rest of the military aid to give Garcia
                    Samayoa a good start in his job.”</p>
                <p>It seemed to me that that was the right thing to do. We had a country team
                    meeting, the Defense Attach� urged me to do it, and his judgment was good, and
                    so did the station chief. The political officers thought it wouldn't hurt, it
                    wouldn't help. He was of two minds about it. And the Public Affairs Officer, Jim
                    Carroll by that time, said it would play very badly in the United States, but
                    who gives a damn how it played in the United States. Could we get the army to
                    move forward? So we released the rest of it.</p>
                <p>All of the time we're dealing with the army on human rights violations. I'm just
                    describing two or three of the most obvious cases, there were many more. We
                    should take time to cover the Maria Unudia__ case. There were many others,
                    perhaps one a week. All the while this was going on we still were fighting the
                    drug war. We still needed the army to help us with it. So through secret funds
                    the CIA has, we were indeed helping the army. So while publicly we're saying,
                    you're bad boys and we're not going to give you this aid, around the back door
                    we are helping them. It's a very difficult and ambivalent situation.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>I pressed the whole time I was in Guatemala for someone to unscramble... This was
                    a decision that was bigger than mine to make. I'm not the one to decide whether
                    the United States government pays more attention to human rights violations, or
                    to drug interdiction. But I was begging for someone up there to make that
                    decision because we were sending totally mixed signals. Not publicly.
                    Publicly—as far as the civilian population was concerned, as far as the
                    government was concerned—we were squarely on the side of human rights and drug
                    interdiction, and the two did not interfere with each other. But in the actual
                    workings of the machinery of how these were accomplished, the people involved in

                <p>STROOCK: That decision was never made. To my knowledge, it has not yet been made.
                    It's a very difficult one to make. It's easy for me to sit here and say, this is
                    the one we ought to do, but it's very difficult for our government to do that.
                    If we make that decision, what decision do they make in the neighboring
                    countries, and how does that affect our relationships with Peru, and Colombia,
                    and Bolivia, and so on.</p>
