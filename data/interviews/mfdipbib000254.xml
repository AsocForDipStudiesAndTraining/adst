                <p>AMBASSADOR CARL C. CUNDIFF</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Raymond Ewing</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: November 22, 1996</p>
                <p>Copyright 2000 ADST</p>
                <p>Q: Carl, you entered the Foreign Service in 1966, I believe. I would like you to
                    tell me a little bit about how you got into the Foreign Service and what was
                    your preparation for it? So, if you could tell us a little bit about where you
                    went to school and where you are from and why the world of foreign affairs was
                    of interest to you.</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I came into the Foreign Service, Ray, I think, largely because of my
                    experience as a teenager when my father worked for AID in the Middle East in
                    Jordan when I was about 16 years of age. Being associated with AID, I was in a
                    community where there were a lot of Foreign Service officers from the embassy
                    around and I was impressed by some of them. And got the idea that the Foreign
                    Service would be a legitimate career alternative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was your father actually in...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Amman, Jordan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did you spend in Jordan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I was there a very brief period of time because I was mostly in school
                    in Switzerland-only in Jordan during the holidays. And that was disrupted by a
                    “coup d'�tat” which took place in Iraq in the summer of 1958, which meant that
                    my step-mother and I were evacuated from Jordan and eventually my father was
                    transferred back to the States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you with him for some other Foreign Service
                        assignments ojust the one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: No. But I had been with him on a number of militarassignments. He was a
                    career military officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And those were in Europe also?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Japan and various military posts in the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then where did you go to college?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I went to undergraduate school at the University of the South in
                    Sewanee, Tennessee and did my junior year abroad in Paris, however, with the
                    Sweet Briar Program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So between some earlier schooling in Switzerland and your
                        junioyear abroad, your French was pretty good.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: It was very good for someone going into college. I had quite an
                    advantage in French for example. And studying junior year abroad reinforced
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go on after your undergraduate degree immediately
                        tgraduate school or did you have to go into the Army?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I went immediately to graduate school. I went to the Fletcher School of
                    Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts.</p>
                <p>Q: And I see that you have a Ph.D. from Fletcher. Were you able to complete that
                    in one period or did you have to go back later to get that?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: No. I completed the Ph.D. program as quickly as you could do it at that
                    time. I did two years of course work at Fletcher. My third year was abroad doing
                    research for my Ph.D. thesis at the American University of Beirut in
                    Lebanon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And your thesis was on Lebanese Industrial Development, I
                        believe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: That is correct.</p>
                <p>Q: And at some point, when you were at Fletcher, you took the Foreign Service
                    examination? Or had you done that already when you were an undergraduate?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I took the exam for the first time when I completed my undergraduate
                    studies. I failed to pass it because it was a day when I had the flu and I
                    failed to pass by about one or two points. I took it a year later at Fletcher
                    and I passed on the positive side by one or two points.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>Q: You didn't have the flu that day! So you...it seems to me that in this period,
                    the mid- sixties, as there has been later and earlier too, a feeling in the
                    State Department and the Foreign Service examination process that we were not
                    getting enough economic officers, those with economic background. You have a
                    strong one by that time with your graduate studies. In the entry process was
                    that emphasized at all or not particularly?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I don't remember in the oral examination which took place in a hotel
                    room near Boston Commons, I don't remember that there were any economic
                    questions in the oral examination. I do remember that after I was accepted in
                    the Foreign Service, I received a second letter saying that I had been put into
                    the economic specialization and if that was okay with me, they would go ahead
                    and do that. I did not reply and that is what happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then when did you actually get your degree from
                        Fletcher?That was 1966?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Well, I received two Master's Degrees from Fletcher. My Ph.D. degree I
                    received after my first assignment which was in Singapore. I submitted my Ph.D.
                    thesis just before I went into the Foreign Service and it was returned to me
                    about a year later. I amended it as necessary in Singapore on my kitchen table
                    and resubmitted it and received my degree in June of 1968, just before I left
                    for my second Foreign Service assignment in Saigon.</p>
                <p>Q: Your first assignment in Singapore immediately followed the orientation A-100
                    course? Or did you have some additional assignment or training in Washington
                    before your first post?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: No. I went immediately from the A-100 training course to Singapore. I
                    thought it would be a two year assignment but the opportunity came along to
                    volunteer for Vietnam and I volunteered to go to Vietnam. So, my Singapore
                    assignment was only for about nineteen months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of work were you doing in Singapore?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Initially I did commercial work in the economic and commercial section.
                    Then shortly after that I went into the consular section where they had a
                    shortage. And I spent almost a year in consular affairs. And after that I spent
                    a few months in the political section doing labor work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then you volunteered for Vietnam? Was that a real
                        volunteeor were you sort of coerced? Did you have a choice at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>CUNDIFF: There was a lot of pressure on people to go to Vietnam and since I
                    wasn't married at the time, I felt that I would probably end up being sent to
                    Vietnam at some point anyway. I was, I guess you might say, anxious to get on
                    with it and I also had friends of mine who were already serving in Saigon. And I
                    wanted to join them if possible.</p>
                <p>Q: So you went there in 1968. It was an interesting and busy time there. Did you
                    go with any Vietnamese language or any other special training? Was this a direct
                    transfer from Singapore to Vietnam?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I was transferred initially back from Singapore to Washington for
                    training. I took two types of training. Initially I was tested for language
                    skills. I did not test high enough to be put in the long-term Vietnamese
                    language training program. So, I completed a counter-insurgency training program
                    and after doing that I went directly to Saigon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were assigned to what...the embassy in Saigon or did
                        you ginto one of the CORDS provincial programs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I was trained for the CORDS provincial programs. But I was interested in
                    serving in the economic section because of my background and I was able to get
                    assigned to that section upon my arrival in Saigon. So I spent my eighteen
                    months in Saigon working on economic issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now was this a combined AID-embassy economic section?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: It was a combined embassy-AID economic section located aUSAID
                    headquarters in Saigon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of things did you do there? And how long were
                        you iVietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I was there for a total of a year and a half and I specialized in
                    taxation. The collection of customs duties and the collection of income taxes.
                    The object of the exercise was to participate with a group of economists who
                    were working on various models for trying to keep down the rate of inflation
                    during the war.</p>
                <p>Q: Was your role and that of the others primarily analytical to try to understand
                    what was happening? Or were you advisors? Or was it some combination of the
                    two?</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Well, I would say, there were two parts to the economic stabilization
                    program. One was to analyze the situation to find out what was going on.
                    Secondly, the object was to use that information to shape our policies and to
                    shape those of the Vietnamese to the extent possible. One of the critical policy
                    questions was how much did we need to provide to the government of Vietnam in
                    the way of commodity import financing so that they could absorb the purchasing
                    power of the economy and keep down price increases.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Remind me sort of, the state of the war in this
                        period-this yeaand a half. Was it coming close to Saigon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: It was close. It was actually in Saigon in a sense. I arrived in June of
                    1968 which as you may recall was right after what we call, “Mini-Tet,” which was
                    an offensive by the other side in May and before that, at the end of January or
                    early February, there had been the big Tet Offensive when the embassy compound
                    had been occupied. And a large part of the city was fought over. When I arrived
                    in Saigon, the city was essentially secure, but there were rockets landing on
                    the city and coming in from the swamps across the river primarily. But that was
                    not a major problem. Terrorism continued while I was there. USAID headquarters
                    was grenaded while I was out actually making an economic demarche in Saigon. So,
                    I went out the entrance to AID and when I came back 25 minutes later there were
                    signs of a grenade attack.</p>
                <p>Q: So there was a feeling you must have had of insecurity about or at least
                    concern about personal security as well as the other broader issues that you
                    were dealing with.</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I would say there was a feeling of insecurity but not the same sort of
                    insecurity that the soldiers would have who were in an actual combat zone.</p>
                <p>Q: I am sure you had good relations with the Vietnamese tax authorities and
                    economic policy officials. Did they have a sense of hope or was there a feeling
                    of despair or discouragement during this period?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I don't remember whether there was hope or discouragement. My impression
                    in general was that people were simply going about their lives as they could
                    under difficult circumstances. And the war just seemed to be part of life. I
                    don't recall that anybody anticipated that it would be over soon but I guess
                    nobody thought it would go on forever either. It seemed like a very long-term
                    commitment on their part and ours. And I worked fairly closely with some young
                    Vietnamese economists in the Central Bank and their moral certainly seemed to be
                    high.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they trained in France or the United States
                        or...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>CUNDIFF: In this case they were trained in the United States. Anthat is probably
                    why we got to know each other a little bit.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you use French quite a bit or was it English?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: No. English largely dealing with the Vietnamese. Some French
                    occasionally with older Vietnamese civil servants. And then I used my
                    rudimentary Vietnamese on the streets and in restaurants and with taxi drivers
                    and that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the head of the joint section in the period that
                        you werthere? Do you remember?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Well, there were a couple of heads of it...it changed. There was
                    somebody by the name of Chuck Cooper who was there for a while. Then there was
                    Bill Sharpe who was head of it for awhile.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were mostly people from AID?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: These were people from AID. However, there was one State Department
                    person at one period of time who was there. I'm sorry I can't remember his name
                    now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But there were several other State Department officers
                        iaddition to you in the...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Yes. There were indeed. I would say that there were probably more AID
                    officers but there were a number from the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you do much outside of the capital in terms of travel
                        anworking with the provinces and people in the provinces?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I personally only made two trips outside the capital. One to the Delta
                    to look at the situation there. I went to Canto for a very brief trip. And went
                    to Da Lat, north of Saigon up into the mountainous area in what we called “Three
                    Corps” at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say you were there...? CUNDIFF: Nineteen months, I
                        think. Eighteen months.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Q: That was kind of the length of your assignment as it was set from the
                    beginning. Was there pressure on you to extend or come back after home leave for
                    another tour?</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>CUNDIFF: No. There was no pressure at that time. Later, when I went to my third
                    assignment in Paris, however, I was put on notice to come back to Vietnam to be
                    part of one of the peace-keeping efforts that was going on at that point
                    monitoring the peace process. But as it turned out, I did not have to go
                    back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because the situation probably, in Vietnam changed. We
                        pulleout, or...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: No. I think the reason I didn't have to go back on an urgent basis from
                    Paris was, as it turned out, they had enough officers to do the job they had in
                    mind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You moved directly from Saigon to Paris in 1969? Or did
                        you havsomething else in Washington or elsewhere in between?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: No. I arrived in Paris...I think it was late January oearly February of
                    1970 after having Christmas at home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your assignment to Paris was what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: That was with the U.S. Mission to the Organization for Economic
                    Cooperation and Development, the OECD, which is an international economic
                    organization of the industrial countries headquartered in Paris.</p>
                <p>Q: Which started out in the Marshall Plan period. I've been reading the book by
                    Richard Bissell, I think, and how he helped put together the European Payments
                    Union and they were certainly involved in the early period in European
                    integration. And many of the habits of European cooperation in receiving and
                    disbursing and coordinating Marshall Plan assistance. Much later, by the time
                    you got there, that was all in the past. But what sort of work were you doing in
                    the Mission to the OECD?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I had essentially two types of assignments actually. One, for the
                    economic counselor who was a State Department person. I attended a committee
                    which reviewed the economy of each of the OECD member countries on a periodic
                    basis and made economic policy recommendations. That was a fairly time demanding
                    responsibility because there were a number of countries in the OECD and their
                    economies are being reviewed all the time.</p>
                <p>I also back-stopped the visits to the OECD by senior economists from Washington,
                    mainly the chairman and the other members of the Council of Economic
                    Advisors.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say you had two bosses. Under the economic counselor,
                        yodid the economic policy review.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Largely macroeconomic policy review of the OECD countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was your other boss?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: My other boss was one of the treasury representatives in the U.S.
                    Mission in the OECD. Under that person I sat on what is called the “Invisibles
                    Committee,” which is a committee which is involved in monitoring the process of
                    liberalization of foreign exchange practices among the industrial countries.</p>
                <p>Q: By this time, the early 1970s, the work of that committee was presumably much
                    less than it had been earlier when they were lots of controls and
                    regulations.</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: That is correct. The work...there was probably less work to be done than
                    there had been right after World War II when there were more comprehensive
                    foreign exchange controls. But the fact is that even when I was in Paris in the
                    early 1970s many of the members of the OECD still had restrictions on capital
                    movements. And largely outward capital movements. And there were also
                    restrictions in the services areas in regards to various services transactions
                    such as: insurance, purchase and sale of real estate, film rights, intellectual
                    property in general and this sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this true particularly in the less advanced OECD
                        countries? Or were there some kinds of restrictions in just about every
                        case?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: There were some restrictions in just about every case. For example, in
                    Canada, a very developed country there were restrictions concerning films and
                    magazines-culturally related transactions. And in France there were restrictions
                    concerning property in particular. And also a lot of property restrictions in a
                    good many of the European countries.</p>
                <p>Q: Let's come back to the other hat or other activities in the macroeconomic
                    policy review and you say that this was almost continuous. Because at that time
                    there was twenty odd OECD countries or even more.</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I think about twenty-one.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>Q: How much response did you feel there was in general to the recommendations or
                    to the process of interaction that took place at the OECD. Did countries listen
                    to advice or was it in some cases sort of preemptory in the sense that they knew
                    they were going to be criticized or asked questions and therefore made
                    adjustments or promised they would make adjustments?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I think it is a little bit of a combination of what you described. I
                    think that countries were very seldom surprised by the analysis and
                    recommendations from the OECD because generally speaking, the OECD staff would
                    have already visited the countries - and spoken with the economists that they
                    needed to see. And they would probably be making recommendations that would not
                    come as a surprise to most professional economists. However, some of these
                    recommendations obviously have political implications. And I think countries
                    generally tend to be a little bit circumspect in regard to accepting advice
                    coming from outside the country.</p>
                <p>Q: One of your roles, I suppose, as a representative of the United States on the
                    committee was not only to understand and participate in economic analysis -
                    although a lot of that was probably done at least in the initial stages by the
                    OECD secretariat or staff. But to kind of give a kind of political understanding
                    and maybe interpretation that were being considered. And I assume you worked
                    with other American embassies as well as agencies in Washington.</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: That is correct. We would share the Secretariat's work, its analysis and
                    recommendations with Washington in advance of meetings. We would also share that
                    in advance with our embassies in the countries concerned. And then we would take
                    the reactions from the embassy and Washington and use that in our own
                    intervention during the review of the Secretariat's work. Essentially you are
                    correct. We would try to address the key policy concerns. Often this had to do
                    with whether the country should be taking a more restricted fiscal policy or a
                    more restrictive monetary policy or to the contrary and be a little more
                    expansionist. And this...if you look at it in broad terms, the idea was to try
                    to help countries orchestrate their growth and their economic progress in a way
                    that would be beneficial to the whole global economy.</p>
                <p>Q: Which part of the U.S. government in Washington did you particularly work with
                    in this area? Was it the State Department, or Treasury?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Well, the three agencies. The State Department obviously, all the time.
                    The office in the State Department was the European Bureau that was responsible
                    for our relations with the OECD and with the European Economic Community. And
                    then also close relations with the Council of Economic Advisors-the President's
                    Council of Economic Advisors. And with the international monetary side of the
                    Treasury Department. Also to some extent with the Federal Reserve Board in
                    Washington, DC - the international side of that.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>Q: You mentioned that you also worked with or for Treasury representatives at the
                    U.S. Mission OECD in the “Invisible's Committee” area. Did Treasury have
                    permanent people assigned to the Mission - or are these people that came from
                    Washington?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: The Treasury had, when I was there, two permanent anfairly senior and
                    experienced Treasury officials.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were, as you say, quite experienced and had other
                        assignmentin Europe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: That is correct.</p>
                <p>Q: Carl, as you know, I came at least once...maybe more than once to Paris to the
                    economic review when you were there. I look back on that as a very rich
                    experience personally because it gave me a chance to interact with Italian
                    government representatives. And I think I was also there in connection with when
                    I was in Switzerland and to be able to hear and participate and get to know the
                    issues and the people was really a very valuable experience. So I'm not sure I
                    would want to do that work every week - or every day. But it certainly helped me
                    in my responsibilities in the embassy in Rome. I thank you for whatever you did
                    to make sure that people from the embassies could actually come and
                    participate.</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Well, that made it a richer experience for me as well. When embassies
                    like yours in Rome were able to send an experienced officer to attend because
                    even though people like myself had read the analysis by the Secretariat and had
                    our instructions perhaps from Washington on individual countries, the fact
                    remains that none of us could be as aware of what was going on say with the
                    Italian economy as say someone like yourself who was in Rome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Paris in the early 1970s was a good place to live and
                        be?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Excellent place to live and be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You really had three overseas foreign service assignments
                        isuccession at the start of your career for a total of about...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Seven years.</p>
                <p>Q: ...seven years which is somewhat unusual. I usually tell people that ask that
                    you usually have two assignments and then you go back to Washington. But in your
                    case it was three. One of which was Vietnam and even in that period after
                    Vietnam one could do something else. What did you do after you left Paris?</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I went for a year of further economic training at the John F. Kennedy
                    School at Harvard University. And I took a program which was essentially in the
                    Economics Department rather than at the JFK School. I took macroeconomics,
                    microeconomics, quantitative methods. I also did a little bit more work in my
                    specialty of development economics and international trade and international
                    development.</p>
                <p>Q: You were sent by the State Department for this year at Harvard. You were able
                    then to, even though you had a strong background at Fletcher and maybe
                    elsewhere, you were able to take courses to complement what you had done before.
                    Some of which probably would have helped you in Paris.</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: That is correct. When I was in Paris I realized that I didn't have as
                    strong a background in quantitative methods that I needed to feel confident as
                    an economist, despite my studies at Fletcher. So I went for a year at Harvard to
                    make myself more professionally capable.</p>
                <p>Q: One of the great things about the Kennedy School of Government and Harvard
                    University, in general for the State Department, in advanced economic training
                    in this period that you were there, and I was there three or four years earlier,
                    is that the great flexibility and freedom that one had to do what really made
                    sense to them and not to be fit into a narrow straight-jacket of course
                    requirements. I think things have changed a bit over the years but I really
                    appreciated that. I was, as I said, there just a few years before you.</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I couldn't agree with you more there. There was tremendous amount of
                    flexibility I thought on the part of the JFK School itself. And it allowed me to
                    choose the courses I wanted to choose, which essentially were very rigorous
                    academic courses in the Economics Department, which I think were perhaps more
                    demanding than the courses I would have had, had I taken specialized courses in
                    the John F. Kennedy School itself. I did take one or two specialized courses
                    there, but largely it was in the Economics Department.</p>
                <p>Q: And the courses you took with your background were probably slightly different
                    than the courses I took with perhaps not as strong a prior background. So it
                    really...although I remember mine as being rigorous and demanding and
                    certainly...</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: They were pretty rigorous and demanding. It was a full year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So then you came back to the Department after you finished
                        the year in Cambridge. This would have been 1974. What was your assignment
                        then, Carl?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I went into the Economic Bureau into what was called the Office of
                    Monetary Affairs. And I was responsible there as I recall for working closely
                    with the Treasury Department on international financial policy affecting largely
                    the international monetary fund. And I was also involved in working, again, on
                    OECD related issues. You may recall that we went through a period of some
                    international financial turmoil as a result of the oil embargo which drove up
                    eventually...the OPEC organization raised the price of oil which had financial
                    ramifications and macroeconomic implications. And our office was very much
                    involved in working on those issues for a number of years.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The whole question of petrodollar recycling and to what
                        extent iwas taking place and where flows were going?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: One of the major issues at the time was how to provide sufficient
                    financial liquidity to economies that were essentially paying a substantially
                    larger proportion of their earnings simply to import petroleum.</p>
                <p>Q: You mentioned that you especially worked on matters relating to the
                    international monetary fund. Were you especially interested in developing
                    countries or more concerned with the international financial system?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: There were two types of issues at the time. The systemic issues that we
                    dealt with in the IMF related to trying to find ways to allow all countries in
                    general to be able to borrow more from the IMF to meet their foreign exchange
                    requirements so they wouldn't have to depress their economies unduly. And there
                    we worked with the Treasury Department on a specific proposal for liberalizing a
                    particular window at the IMF called the Compensatory Financing Facility. That
                    was one major project.Another aspect of the work was, I think you would say,
                    more involved with developed countries. We were working closely with Treasury to
                    provide financing - either international or bilateral American financing to
                    economies facing particularly critical balance of payments crisis at the time. I
                    don't remember the details but the kinds of economies we were dealing with were
                    certainly fairly developed. Italy comes to mind. France. Maybe the United
                    Kingdom. Mexico I believe was even mentioned...some of the developing countries
                    too. But I think it was largely on the industrial side. And that was all because
                    of the impact of higher oil prices. In some cases, these problems for these
                    countries actually passed over time but at the point I was looking at them they
                    were considered to be fairly serious economic issues.</p>
                <p>Q: I guess it was the Ford Administration and then perhaps the beginning of the
                    Carter Administration. Was there generally in the kinds of things you were
                    working on and the issues you were dealing with a unanimity or common point of
                    view between the Department of State and Treasury? Or were we coming at it from
                    very divergent points of views or perspectives?</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I really don't feel competent to characterize the relationships at that
                    time at the higher levels. At the level I was working at from the technical side
                    we had good relations with Treasury. I think at higher levels there was
                    considerable policy debate about which way to go on certain matters. I don't
                    think that the issues, even there, were differences on general directions. I
                    think there were more differences on modalities. How much to liberalize this or
                    that facility, how generous or what have you to be with the financial terms that
                    we might offer or the international financial institutions might offer. It was
                    an exciting period. These issues were debated at very senior levels.</p>
                <p>Q: And from your perspective as basically the working level in the Office of
                    Monetary Affairs, you had a sense that the State Department was very interested
                    in these important international subjects and was playing a significant role in
                    policy formulation?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I think so. I think that is a fair statement. They became important
                    issues at the time because of the magnitude of the oil and petroleum issue...the
                    price of petroleum, the supply of petroleum. And the financial ramifications of
                    that. Financial issues of course lead on to concrete economic problems as well.
                    Economies facing a financial crisis have to cut back on expenditures; it is
                    going to result in unemployment. It can have major political impact. So there
                    was a lot of high level concern and coordination.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you work at all with the private banking community - the financial
                    community - in the United States? Or was it primarily interagency and with the
                    International Monetary Fund in Washington?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: It was largely interagency in nature. Direct relations with the IMF were
                    usually through the Treasury Department, State having less direct discussion
                    with the IMF. It is usually Treasury with the IMF. Our discussions were largely
                    with Treasury and with the Federal Reserve Board. And with the OMB (Office of
                    Management and Budget).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you go to meetings at the IMF occasionally?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Very occasionally, but not on a regular basis, no. Certainly not. To be
                    frank about it, I can't remember a meeting at the IMF. World Bank, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you working on matters relating to the World Bank
                        durinthat period as well or mostly with what you've already mentioned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Only with regard to the general issues of petrodollafinancing not with
                    regard to development projects.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>Q: Did you think...let's see...the sharp increase in oil prices I guess took
                    place just before you came into the office in early 1974 if I remember
                    correctly. Did you feel that the period you were there that this problem had
                    been...was being dealt with appropriately through this sort of bundle of
                    responses and mechanisms.</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I think so yes. As I recall there was a very comprehensive approach to
                    the issues. I was working on the financial side but we had other parts of the
                    Economic Bureau working on the energy side for example. The energy office in the
                    Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs was very active at that time. Just as
                    our office was. In fact, I would say that Finance and Energy were the
                    two-perhaps among the two most interesting issues going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because that was about the period when the International
                        EnergAgency was formulated and established in Paris.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Exactly.</p>
                <p>Q: So that there was an effort to have emergency sharing arrangements in place to
                    deal with future crisis either interruptions of supply or sharp price
                    increases.</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Right. I think that is a normal part of the Foreign Affairs process. A
                    crisis comes along and governments are obliged to devise mechanisms to avoid
                    being surprised and damaged in the future should such occasions come up
                    again.</p>
                <p>Q: You mentioned that some of your work in the Office of Monetary Affairs
                    involved the OECD in addition to the IMF. Were we using the OECD effectively
                    during this period for coordination among the industrial and developed
                    countries?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I think so. I think the advantage of the OECD as an organization of
                    industrial countries is that it provides a forum where governments can meet and
                    coordinate their positions together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go to Paris some in that period or pretty much
                        stayed iWashington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: No, I went to Paris quite a bit in the context of the North-South
                    dialogue. At that time you may recall that there was a movement afoot
                    particularly in the developing world to change the nature of the International
                    Economic System. There was a dialogue engaged in Paris and it went on for some
                    time which had many components to it. One was the energy component. Another was
                    the financial component. And that was the one I was involved in.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>Q: My recollection of that dialogue, and I was not involved myself was that we
                    were basically willing to engage in a dialogue but we weren't willing to change
                    very much. Was that true of the area you were involved with in the financial
                    side?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I would say that there was a lot of caution on the part of the
                    industrial nations. I think that the general feeling on the industrial country
                    side was that the international financial institutions developed at Breton Woods
                    - the World Bank and the IMF - were basically sound institutions that perhaps
                    there was some scope for change but not substantial change.</p>
                <p>I think it is fair to say that there was a certain ideology strongly held by some
                    of the developing countries that the international financial institutions should
                    be changed substantially. And to be frank about it, to their benefit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it a committee that you went to Paris to participate
                        in thainvolved both OECD countries and developing countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: That is correct. It was part of the North-South dialogue. One of the
                    components was a committee being composed as you say of developed and developing
                    countries and it was in that context that we discussed the current institutional
                    arrangements and possible future changes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that group committee have co-chairs? Or under whose
                        auspicedid it meet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I can't remember. I think it was co-chaired.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or perhaps rotating co-chairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: But I don't remember. I think that there was probably a chairman on the
                    developed countries side and a chairman on the developing countries side but I
                    don't...but my memory does not serve me on the exact form of those
                    discussions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well it is 1996 now. I wonder if some form of that
                        North-Soutdialogue is still taking place? It went on for many years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I think it is sort of an on-going dialogue in a sense that it moves from
                    forum to forum and changes its character from time to time. But the essential
                    element of it is how do you work cooperatively between the more developed
                    countries and those that are still at a lower level of income.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>Q: And you worked together in many different ways obviously. Through different
                    institutions and as many facets. Carl, you were in the Office of Monetary
                    Affairs for about three years.</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: That is correct.</p>
                <p>Q: Pretty much working on this same set of issues throughout that time?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: That is correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And from there, where? Overseas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: No. I transferred to another three year assignment in the Department.
                    This time with the Africa Bureau. I became the Director of the Economic Policy
                    Staff in the Bureau of African Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now this was your first exposure or experience with
                        Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: That is correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you traveled in Africa at all from Paris or
                        elsewhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: No. I had not been to Africa. I went into the job because of my economic
                    background. The Africa Bureau apparently felt that they needed to have a strong
                    economic officer in charge of their regional economic office and I was fortunate
                    enough to be chosen.</p>
                <p>Q: This was a central office...a regional office for the entire continent of
                    Africa. What sort of issues did you get involved with as opposed to the desk
                    officers in the various geographic divisions in the Bureau? I imagine you worked
                    on problems to do for example with South Africa. How did you do...what did you
                    do as opposed to the South African desk officer?</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>CUNDIFF: In the case of South Africa, I coordinated a study of economic sanctions
                    at some point...I don't remember which year. It was under the Carter
                    Administration. You may recall there was considerable debate at the time about
                    economic sanctions. We looked at that from the point of view of the impact of
                    sanctions, for example, on the U.S. economy. As well as from the point of view
                    of the impact on South Africa itself. I don't recall any distinct line of
                    responsibility differences between our office and the desk. The desk by and
                    large at that time in the Africa Bureau did not have a lot of economic
                    expertise. This differed according to desk. There were some country directorates
                    that had very capable experienced, economic officers and others that frankly had
                    so much work on the political side that they were very happy to have an office
                    within the Bureau that specialized on economic policy issues.</p>
                <p>Q: And you got involved in rescue and large aid programs for certain countries?
                    And I supposed that involved not only working with the geographic desk but also
                    with AID?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: That was the...I would say the principal focus of my effort over the
                    three years. Namely to work on AID packages for different crisis countries. I
                    worked on Zaire, for example, during two periods of crisis and went to Paris and
                    to Brussels on a couple of trips where we coordinated with other AID donors,
                    namely Belgium and France. I also worked on developing AID packages for Zambia
                    and the Sudan and perhaps for a couple of other places in Africa that were
                    experiencing severe economic problems.</p>
                <p>The work that I did concerned coordination with USAID practically every day and I
                    was looking at the allocation of AID resources to Africa. And advising our
                    Assistant Secretary of State and his principal deputies about what were the best
                    ways to go about helping various countries in Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Assistant Secretary of State in that
                        period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: During that entire period it was Dick Moose.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you reported to him directly? Or through one of the
                        DeputAssistant Secretaries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I reported to him through one of the Deputy Assistant Secretaries. At
                    one time it was an AID officer by the name of Vern Johnson and at another time
                    it was a political appointee, Carol Lancaster.</p>
                <p>Q: Who has a very strong background in African economic matters and has been, I
                    think, recently, in a very senior position at AID. I don't know if she still
                    is.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>CUNDIFF: That is correct. And she has also been a professor aGeorgetown School of
                    Foreign Service Studies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had a staff working for you. How large was this office
                        athis time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: In addition to myself as I recall, there were three or four other
                    officers and one or two secretaries in that office. It was a small office
                    compared to the four regional directorates in the Africa Bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in export promotion, commercial
                        services bit working with the Department of Commerce?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: We did. We were involved with the Department of Commerce in trying to be
                    helpful to U.S. business interests in Africa. Both with regard to encouraging
                    U.S. exports, helping facilitate exports, and also with regard to helping to
                    encouraging investment opportunities as well.</p>
                <p>Q: But your personal main focus during much of the period was the AID packages
                    for crisis countries and day to day coordination work in Washington?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: That is correct. I would say that 75-80% of my time was focused on
                    various forms of bilateral U.S. assistance which could be in the form of
                    security assistance, in the form of development assistance. In many cases also
                    food aid - PL-480. The amounts of money involved were sometimes quite
                    substantial.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a chance to travel some in Africa during
                        thiperiod? Or mostly to Paris and Brussels and places like
                        that...London?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I made one initial orientation trip to Africa where I visited Mali,
                    Ivory Coast, Nigeria and Kenya and Zaire. And then I made one trip to Paris and
                    two trips to Brussels.</p>
                <p>Q: During the period that you were in this office, in the Bureau of African
                    Affairs, was it your sense or the general sense that things were going downhill
                    rapidly? Or was there some hope about individual economies in Africa? Would you
                    have any general observations about how things on the economic side seemed to be
                    progressing?</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>CUNDIFF: My impression is that at the time there was a general sense of optimism
                    about the future of Africa economically and politically. This was a period, you
                    may recall, politically when we were working on bringing about independence in
                    Zimbabwe for example. Bringing about majority rule, rather, in Zimbabwe and
                    bringing about change eventually in South Africa and Namibia. It was a period
                    when I think a lot of the political focus was on Southern Africa. But it was
                    also a period when, as you may recall, Nigeria was a democracy and Shehu Shagari
                    was the president. I would say that there was quite a bit of optimism in general
                    about Africa. Not unreal optimism but generally a fairly positive view.</p>
                <p>Q: And even the AID packages for the difficult situations in Sudan, Zambia, Zaire
                    were seen as trying to consolidate and trying to deal with very real problems
                    but not situations of despair or chaos or disillusion or collapse.</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I think that is fairly fair to say. There had been just before I came
                    into this office you may recall in the early 1970s a major food crisis in the
                    Sahel. It had gotten a lot of coverage on television. I think there was a large
                    public interest in bringing humanitarian assistance to countries that were faced
                    with climatic crisis...such as in the dry areas of Africa.</p>
                <p>Q: Come back to South Africa again for a moment. You said you coordinated and
                    participated in a study of sanctions. At that point there really weren't
                    significant economic sanctions - or were there? Certainly not as there were
                    later on.</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I forget the details of that period to be frank with you. I'm not sure
                    at what stage we were with regard to that topic. My memory fails me.</p>
                <p>Q: So, you finished this assignment as you say, it was a three year assignment,
                    in 1980. Then you went abroad again, I think. What was your next assignment?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I went to Lagos, Nigeria, as Economic Counselor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And when you got there, Nigeria was still a functioning
                        democracy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: It was a functioning democracy. In fact the day I arrived, Vice
                    President Mondale as I recall was visiting Nigeria. And the first week on the
                    job was taken up to help support a very large U.S. delegation that was
                    accompanying the Vice President for an official visit to Nigeria.</p>
                <p>Q: That I am sure was very demanding, on the other hand it probably gave you
                    entree and opportunity to do things and meet people it might have taken a year
                    to do.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>CUNDIFF: That is correct. It was an intensive, rapid orientation and it did give
                    me an opportunity to become involved with the issues and essentially a good deal
                    of my assignment in Nigeria was taken with follow-up to that visit. Because
                    later there was a follow-up visit by the Vice President of Nigeria to Washington
                    as well. And we had to monitor, if you will, the progress of engagements that
                    had been taken on both sides to have closer economic cooperation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a period in Nigeria, not too long after OPEC and
                        the oiprice increases, when the oil sector was booming and flourishing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: When I was in Nigeria initially, oil prices were high and Nigeria was
                    earning substantial amounts of foreign exchange. I forget the exact figures but
                    I think they were earning something on the order of $2 billion dollars a month
                    in foreign exchange earnings from petroleum. But after I had been there, I think
                    it was about a year, the bottom fell out of the petroleum market and prices went
                    down very rapidly and quite substantially and eventually to the point where I
                    think Nigeria was earning perhaps something close to 600-700 million dollars in
                    foreign exchange per month. So there was an incredibly rapid decline in foreign
                    exchange earnings that had a major impact on Nigeria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because they had made commitments and undertaken
                        investmentanticipating continuing that high rate of foreign exchange?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Yes. They had undertaken very large development projects, particularly
                    in the agricultural area. But also elsewhere in the economy there were a lot of
                    construction projects going forward. There were a lot of road projects, the
                    building of public buildings, bridges, large river valley development projects
                    and in general just the very expansive economy which was abruptly affected by a
                    substantial change in the financial outlook.</p>
                <p>Q: I have always been struck by the preponderance of Nigeria in U.S. trade with
                    Africa, largely in the petroleum sector. To what extent were you, as economic
                    counselor, involved with American companies? Were they undertaking a lot of the
                    investment-involved with these projects that you mentioned? Or was it primarily
                    European involvement?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I would say that the U.S. oil companies had a very substantial role in
                    the Nigeria petroleum sector. But, Shell Oil Company was there and as I recall
                    was perhaps the largest of the large in terms of its petroleum operations,
                    having been there before independence. Shell was the largest company. But we had
                    a couple of American companies with very substantial operations including Texaco
                    and Mobil Oil but also others.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>Q: And you said, in part as a result of the Vice President's visit, we were
                    involved in a number of joint projects or programs working together in that
                    period. So there really was a very strong and close interchange between Nigeria
                    and the United States on the economic side.</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: There was an effort, I think, on both sides to expand the economic
                    relationship beyond petroleum. There was an effort to encourage investments in
                    other areas and a general desire to expand opportunities. I think American
                    companies in particular were anxious, if you will, to have more business with
                    Nigeria. Nigeria was a prosperous, developing country with great potential
                    because of its oil earnings. And I think the feeling was that we ought to be
                    expanding our relationship beyond just petroleum into other parts of the
                    business relationship.</p>
                <p>Q: Was that resisted either by Nigerians or British or other Western Europeans
                    who perhaps had been there ahead of us...or ahead of our companies?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I think that there was a friendly rivalry going on, as there always is
                    in the business world between companies competing for contracts. A lot of the
                    business in Nigeria then, and probably still, takes the form of contracts with
                    the government.</p>
                <p>Q: I see here that you monitored a major fertilizer project supported by the U.S.
                    Export- Import Bank. That was sort of an example of trying to get beyond the
                    petroleum sector. What sort of project was that?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I can't remember all the details of that. But I think it wasn't totally
                    outside of petroleum. It was a project using petroleum to create fertilizers.
                    And at this point I can't remember the details of that project but at that time
                    it kept me fairly busy trying to take care of the interest of the U.S.
                    Export-Import bank in working on the project, because it was a financial
                    engagement by the Export-Import Bank.</p>
                <p>I was also involved with trying to take care of the interest of the Overseas
                    Private Investment Corporation-OPIC. And there we were dealing with a case of a
                    project which had run into difficulty and where there were financial claims
                    involved and we were trying to reach a satisfactory settlement of that issue.
                    Again, it took quite a bit of time and effort to work with the Nigerian
                    authorities on that project.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a commercial attach� of the Foreign Commercial
                        Servicin the embassy in Lagos in that period?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Yes, there was. And in fact the commercial side of the embassy's
                    operation expanded while I was there. And we increased the rank of the
                    commercial representative. He became a commercial counselor. The person happened
                    to be a Foreign Service officer but there was a major effort to expand the
                    commercial section, if you will, of the embassy. That was a period when you may
                    recall we separated out the commercial function from the Foreign Service at the
                    State Department and established the Foreign Commercial Service at the
                    Department of Commerce. That took place on my watch in Lagos.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that was a separate section from the Economic Section
                        thayou headed up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Yes. And when I arrived in Lagos, those functions as I recall, were
                    initially or had been together in the same office. But when I arrived we were in
                    the process of separating out the two functions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador in Lagos when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: My first year, the ambassador was Steve Low. The nexyear, the ambassador
                    was Tom Pickering.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Two great figures of the modern Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Yes. And I worked quite closely with both of them during that period.
                    The economic side of the relationship with Nigeria was, I think it is fair to
                    say, very important.</p>
                <p>Q: You were there when the election of 1980 took place in the United States. On
                    the economic side did that make much impact when Ronald Reagan succeeded Jimmy
                    Carter?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It certainly had no particular effect on the work you
                        did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Not particularly. I don't recall any particular effect athat time.</p>
                <p>Q: I've never served in Nigeria but I've always had the sense that, from visits
                    and from what I've heard, of sharp cleavages, if you will, between different
                    parts of this very large nation and over ethnic differences, religious
                    differences. And this is more I suppose on the political side but is that
                    something that you ran into on the economic side as well that you were aware
                    of?</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I'm not sure I understand your question.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The differences between the North, the East, the
                        West...were thecompeting for the projects, for investment by U.S.
                        firms?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I don't think that economically there was a major relationship between
                    business activities and internal regional and ethnic differences within Nigeria.
                    The fact is that the very large bulk of U.S. investment was in petroleum and
                    that investment is in the southern part of the country either along the coast or
                    offshore. A good deal of it is in the eastern sector of Nigeria but I can't
                    really say that there was a big interrelationship there between ethnic rivalry,
                    if you will, and business operations.</p>
                <p>Q: At that time we had a consulate, I suppose, in the North in Kano or Kaduna.
                    Was there any other consulate in the south central part of Nigeria?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: At that time we had a small USIA operation still functioning in Kano. I
                    think it was a USIA library and cultural center in Kano. In Kaduna we had also a
                    cultural center as I recall but we had the consulate general in Kaduna. We had
                    no other operations outside Lagos other than that. At that time Abuja was being
                    or had been declared “the new national capital of Nigeria,” and we were
                    beginning to talk about how we would establish an embassy in Abuja at some
                    point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But at that time, there was no great pressure for the
                        embassy testablish a presence in Abuja?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: There may have been some initial pressure but I don't recall myself that
                    it was something that we envisaged having to do instantly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The economic ministries and the Central Bank were all in
                        Lagostill?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Yes. And I think it was envisaged that the economic and commercial
                    institutions would probably continue to be based in Lagos despite the
                    establishment of the official capital in Abuja. Possibly, the Ministry of
                    Finance might have to be in Abuja at some point. Other Ministries would have to
                    have their headquarters in Abuja but I'm not so sure that the Central Bank, for
                    example, was going to have to move to Abuja.</p>

                <p>Q: And this gave you a chance to use your French, again. You have been head of

                    both of which were supervisory positions but of small sections in terms of staff
                    in both cases. Embassy Abidjan is a pretty large mission. What did you see as
                    your primary function/responsibility there?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Well, I think that my primary role there was to be the principal manager
                    of the mission under the overall management and direction of the ambassador.
                    This meant in a sense that my function was to support the ambassador's
                    objectives and to interpret his requirements to the directors of the other
                    agencies located in the mission in Abidjan. And to work with them and work with
                    the ambassador to make sure the operation was smoothly functioning.</p>
                <p>Q: The agencies in Abidjan are of course concerned with Ivory Coast, an important
                    country in West Africa. But I also think in the period you were there they had
                    regional responsibilities to some extent. It is kind of a regional center for
                    Francophone West Africa. How did you deal with those agencies that really
                    weren't all that interested in what was going on in Abidjan - were more
                    interested in a broader region? Was that a problem sometimes?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I think that is one of the challenges that managers at a post like
                    Abidjan always face. That is to say that you have some people who are working in
                    the mission who are focused on the bilateral mission's objectives and working
                    with the local/host government in that regard.</p>
                <p>And then you have other members of your larger mission whose function may not be
                    to relate at all to the Ivory Coast or the C�te d'Ivoire and whose major
                    function is to travel in the area and support their agencies' objectives in
                    other countries in the area. In the case of Abidjan the principal example is
                    AID. While I was in Abidjan, AID had minimal contact and activities with the
                    Ivory Coast because the Ivory Coast was considered to be a fairly high income
                    country by African standards at the time. And we had very, very minimal support
                    through AID...hardly any as I recall.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>And at the same time we had a very large AID presence but the AID presence was
                    focused on supporting AID missions throughout West Africa. So you had
                    agricultural experts and educational experts and health experts who spent a good
                    deal of their time traveling outside of Ivory Coast-whose families remained in
                    Ivory Coast as part of our mission. But these officials really had
                    responsibilities throughout the area.</p>
                <p>Q: Did that create some community, some morale problems sometimes? You didn't
                    have maybe as many people to be on the school board or play soft ball or
                    whatever people do as part of an American embassy community as you might in
                    another post in Africa.</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I think that presents for management, in a post like that, it presents a
                    challenge to keep morale high by having activities where everybody feels like
                    part of the official family. And when I was in Abidjan working with Ambassador
                    Rawls and later with Ambassador Miller for three years...especially Ambassador
                    Miller and his wife and my wife, we all worked very hard to create an atmosphere
                    where everybody felt that their work was appreciated and where there were
                    opportunities for social engagements with each other. I would have to say that
                    we were fairly successful at that.</p>
                <p>Q: Before we come to U.S. relations with C�te d'Ivoire, I would like to ask you
                    if you were involved or the embassy was involved in the African Development
                    Board or any other regional organizations that had their headquarters in
                    Abidjan?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: We were involved as a U.S. mission in working with the U.S. Executive
                    Director to the African Development Bank and Fund. Essentially our support, as I
                    recall, was more of administrative support because the U.S. Executive Director
                    to the African Development is a Treasury Department official. His or her
                    responsibilities are really not under those of the ambassador per se. But we had
                    a cooperative relationship and the U.S. executive director of the African
                    Development Bank and Fund was invited to our Country Team meetings. And
                    certainly he was made to feel a complete member of the official “American
                    Family.” We had very close and productive relations but still the functions were
                    quite different.</p>
                <p>Q: Turning to the government of C�te d'Ivoire, under the direction of the
                    ambassador you, besides supervising and coordinating the agencies probably also
                    supervised the political-economic as well as counselor and administrative
                    functions. Were you involved yourself directly in contacts at high levels in the
                    government or in reporting? Or was that pretty much done by others?</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I was involved in a quite a bit of the high level contact work. The
                    first year I was there, I served quite often as charg�. Ambassador Rawls had a
                    medical problem that required her to return to the Unites States periodically so
                    I served as charg� d'affaires fairly often. In that context I had direct contact
                    with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and with other ministers in the
                    government. And when I was deputy chief of mission under Ambassador Miller, I
                    continued to have substantial contact with high level officials and ministers.
                    Not as often perhaps as I had under Ambassador Rawls. But again, I served as
                    charg� during periods when Ambassador Miller was on vacation or on consultations
                    in Washington and so on. So I had a lot of high level contact on a regular
                    basis.</p>
                <p>In terms of economic and political reporting, I supervised the economic and
                    political sections. In that regard I was responsible for those functions.</p>
                <p>Q: C�te d'Ivoire, as we have said, is a hub of communications in the region. Was
                    the government, was the embassy interested and involved with other regional
                    issues of interest and concern? Of course the war had not yet started in
                    Liberia. I don't know if there were any sort of regional issues that you
                    particularly got involved with during the period you were there?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Not that I recall. The issues of a political nature were largely the
                    standard diplomatic dialogue with the host government of the Ivory Coast.</p>
                <p>Q: And the head of government, the head of state was Houphouet-Boigny. He had
                    been there for a long time. He was called the “Old Man” or I don't know what he
                    was called...</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: That is right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have contact with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I had contact with him upon occasion, largely of course when I was
                    serving as charg�; from time to time I had to make demarches directly to the
                    President.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But probably more with the Minister of Foreign
                        Affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there elections and political parties in this
                        period?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>CUNDIFF: At that period there was essentially the one dominant party of the
                    President, which had been around a long, long time, the PDCI. This was a
                    political party that went back to the period of obtaining independence from
                    France.</p>
                <p>Q: Speaking of France, in Francophone West Africa or Africa I guess we always
                    have to ask about the interaction with the French embassy, with the French
                    business community that was sizable. How did you assess that at the time you
                    were there? Was there room for the United States to do things, and
                    opportunity?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Well, there was certainly room for the United States to do things and
                    the opportunity. At the time, Phillips Petroleum, for example, had a very large
                    investment in the development of an offshore petroleum platform not too far from
                    Abidjan. And there were other U.S. companies involved. Mobil Oil was involved in
                    a small refining project. And there were some other U.S. businesses. Citibank
                    was there. And Morgan Guaranty Bank was there. And Chase Manhattan Bank was
                    there.</p>
                <p>But, the fact remained that the French were in a very strong commercial position.
                    Many commercial investments had been made in earlier years and those were still
                    being managed and expanded by the French. But, I would say in some ways, the
                    French presence was declining gradually. In response I think to declining
                    economic opportunities in the Ivory Coast. That was a period when coffee and
                    cocoa prices were no longer so strong and Ivory Coast was in the midst of an
                    economic crisis that frankly went on as I recall for some time thereafter.</p>
                <p>Q: It was the same period that the neighboring country of Ghana was going through
                    a very difficult economic situation for some of the same reasons but other
                    reasons as well. And then I am sure there was also the fact that coffee and
                    cocoa prices were largely set internationally - supply and demand and increased
                    supply from new producers and so on. But I'm sure that internally or
                    domestically there was always debate about reducing your prices and whether the
                    government should subsidize growers and that probably caused a lot of political
                    controversy.</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: That is correct. The internal pricing of cocoa and coffee prices was a
                    major issue. And traditionally Ivory Coast had a very centralized government
                    control and purchasing operation where the small farmers, particularly on the
                    cocoa side but also coffee, would sell their produce to a government controlled
                    agency. Which in turn would be involved with the processing of the coffee and
                    the export of the coffee and cocoa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the embassy much interested in what was happening in
                        eitheLiberia or Ghana, both immediately neighboring countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Yes. Interested but not seized in what I would say was an active way
                    because Liberia for example had some very severe difficulties as I recall.
                    Samuel Doe had come to power during that time. We had an embassy in Monrovia
                    which was dealing with him and with that government. And just as we had your
                    embassy in Accra dealing with Rawlings and his government. So I would say that
                    we were keeping an eye on the area-neighboring countries but not actively
                    engaged if you will in any other way.</p>
                <p>Q: Because later on in the case of Liberia there were refugees. There was perhaps
                    assistance going to Charles Taylor and others through C�te d'Ivoire and I think
                    the embassy in Abidjan got quite involved in issues related to Liberia but that
                    came later.</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: That was later. During my time there I made a personal trip into Liberia
                    to the iron ore operation in Northern Liberia. Across the border and the river
                    there and into upper Liberia. But that was strictly a personal trip.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any U.S. mining activity going on in C�te
                        d'Ivoirduring that period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: None that I recall. The oil exploration and developmenwas
                    substantial.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was most of the oil offshore?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Yes. In fact, to my knowledge, all offshore.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The embassy building was new, or was it old?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Old.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was old but built for us. A nice building I
                        suppose.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Not really. It was a very small rented building in downtown Abidjan. It
                    was small in comparison to our requirements. We did not feel comfortable with it
                    from a security point of view because it was right on the street and we did not
                    have a compound around it with a large fence and that sort of thing that you
                    might have in a lot of newer embassies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is it the building that we still have as far as you
                        know?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: To my knowledge we are still in that same building.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>Q: Was security a major concern at the time you were there? Other than the
                    general concern about terrorism and threats emanated from our experience in
                    places like Tehran and Beirut and the Middle East?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Well, that was a period as you know, because of developments in the
                    Middle East, embassies worldwide were concerned with security. And Abidjan, like
                    all other embassies, was taking measures to make our situation more secure. We
                    did not, we didn't feel any threat from within the Ivory Coast or really from
                    within the region. Our concern was more with spill-over possibly from the Middle
                    East.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a large Lebanese community in Abidjan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Yes. And growing as a result of the instability and problems in Lebanon.
                    There were many Lebanese families in Ivory Coast and they kept in close contact
                    with their family members in Lebanon. There was very substantial travel between
                    Abidjan and Lebanon. As I recall Middle East Airways provided service between
                    the two.</p>
                <p>Q: You mentioned earlier that you did your Ph.D. research in Beirut, in Lebanon.
                    Have you kept in touch with matters relating to Lebanon over the years or with
                    Lebanese in a place like Abidjan? Did that sort of give you entree or something
                    at least to talk about?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Yes, it gave me something to talk about and some entree you might say.
                    But I think speaking French well was as helpful to me as anything else in
                    meeting Lebanese in Ivory Coast.</p>
                <p>Q: We talked a little bit before about your assignment to Lagos, about Abuja, the
                    new capital in Nigeria, which was just then being conceived and getting
                    underway. C�te d'Ivoire has another capital, too, Yamoussoukro?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't know exactly at the time you were there what its
                        statuwas and did you need to go there frequently?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I'm a little vague on what the status was at the time. While I was there
                    I think it was declared the capital of Ivory Coast as an honor to
                    Houphouet-Boigny, the President, since it is his home town. President
                    Houphouet-Boigny had built a number of facilities at Yamoussoukro already
                    including a large palace for himself and a large party headquarters and a very
                    nice luxury hotel. And as well, a number of educational institutions with a
                    focus on science and technology and teaching. But he also was in the process of
                    building a large basilica in Yamoussoukro which I later visited when I came back
                    to Ivory Coast.</p>
                <p>Q: At the time you were there, when you were the charg� and did meet with the
                    President...you usually did that in Abidjan or did you go to Yamoussoukro?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: In my case it was always in Abidjan. The President's office was downtown
                    and his home, his residence, was usually where he received diplomats and that
                    was close to where I lived and many of the other diplomats lived as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was near that big hotel, I think also.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: That is correct. Near the H�tel d'Ivoire. In Cocody,which is a part of
                    Abidjan, by the hotel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything else about the assignment to Abidjan
                        that whaven't covered that you would like to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I don't think so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After Abidjan in 1986, you came back to the State
                        Department think. What job did you come to then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I went back into the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs and I was
                    the Director of the Office of Food Policy and Programs, working very closely
                    with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Office of the Special U.S. Trade
                    Representative and with USAID on a number of international food policy issues
                    and again working somewhat on issues related to the relocation of PL-480 food
                    aid. Most of my time was taken up as that period by policy issues surrounding
                    the subsidization of U.S. grains.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Subsidization of U.S. grains for...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: For exports.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>Q: Exports. Okay.</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: The European community was subsidizing its grain and the United States
                    was trying to take action to counter that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We tried to talk the European community out of
                        subsidizinexports to no avail I guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: That is correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And so we instituted our own program...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Our own program of agricultural export subsidies to takcare of American
                    agricultural interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were grain exports to the developing world or all
                        expormarkets?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: In most cases we were talking about grain exports tdeveloping countries
                    such as North Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which Europeans probably thought of as one of their
                        markets thathey shouldn't have to share with the United States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I'm not sure what they were thinking but they certainly hasubstantial
                    commercial interests there.</p>
                <p>Carl, in the Food Policy office, you obviously mentioned several other agencies
                    that you worked with on export subsidies and food aid issues. Was the Economic
                    Bureau carrying quite a bit of weight? Were the other agencies interested in our
                    recommendations in this area that you were involved with? To what extent were
                    other agencies receptive to the views that we had about agricultural export
                    subsidies, about how food aid should be allocated by country? Was your office
                    and the Economic Bureau playing a significant role in the interagency
                    framework?</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I think the relationship was cooperative and we were playing what I
                    think was a helpful role. My recollection of the period is that we didn't have
                    any fundamental differences between agencies about these matters, including the
                    Export Enhancement Program. Essentially it was a matter of degree. Not a
                    question of the general direction of policy but only a question of degree.
                    Issues would come up with regard to the impact of subsidies on other countries'
                    exports. You mentioned that Canada also exports grains and Australia exports
                    grains. And obviously we wanted to be sure that while we were countering the
                    subsidy program of the European community we were not doing damage to some of
                    our other commercial partners.</p>
                <p>Q: And you needed to work also, I suppose, with other parts of the State
                    Department - the geographic bureaus and perhaps in some cases our embassies in
                    particular countries. Was that difficult? Or generally did they allow you to
                    exercise your judgement without a lot of advice and critiquing from
                    elsewhere?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Well, again I would say it was a cooperative process where we basically
                    arrived at a State Department position as a result of consultations within the
                    Department, between the Economic Bureau and the regional bureaus. Nobody was
                    excluded from that process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ok. That was from 1986-88. And in 1988 you had another
                        overseaassignment. Where was that and how did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I went out as U.S. ambassador to the Republic of Niger iAfrica-going
                    back to West Africa for the third time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And had you been to Niger before from Abidjan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I had not been to Niger before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were nominated by, let's see...who would it have
                        been?</hi>

                <p>CUNDIFF: President Reagan.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And confirmed by the Senate.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Correct.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any difficulty with the Senate Foreign

                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Not personally. A number of us were held up for reasons that I don't
                    remember and probably never fully understood at the time. They were not related
                    to me. They were of some other nature but there was a delay and eventually we
                    were approved. One day at midnight, just before one of its periodic
                    recesses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So when did you actually arrive “in country,” late in
                        1988?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: As I recall, we arrived in August 1988 in Niamey. And wstayed for three
                    years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Niamey is in the Sahel. It is, I suppose, a
                        semi-deserenvironment. What sort of city is it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: It is as you described. It is a city in a very arid region-the Sahel. It
                    is essentially a very modest city consisting of fairly low buildings usually
                    yellow or brown in color and I would say it is a fairly modest city.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Roughly how large is the capital and how large is Niger
                        when yowere there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Niger itself is the 6th largest country in Africa, geographically. I
                    can't remember what scale that comes to in comparison to parts of the United
                    States. But it is a fairly large country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Population?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Population-I can't remember precisely what the population was at the
                    time but it was about seven to eight million. And Niamey itself probably had
                    maybe a half million people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it is fairly sparsely populated given the geographic
                        size othe country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Very sparsely populated. People largely live in the agricultural area,
                    in small towns and in small villages and cities and the countryside trying to
                    make a living in dry-land agriculture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what sort of government did Niger have at the time
                        when yowent?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>CUNDIFF: When I arrived it was a government with a single politicaparty and with
                    a military officer as president.</p>
                <p>Q: Niger is part of the former French colonial area of Africa so I assume the
                    French influence as was the case in C�te d'Ivoire was quite strong still.</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: The French influence, I would say, was somewhat strong but not really as
                    strong as in the Ivory Coast in the sense that...maybe the right word is not so
                    much “French influence” as French presence. There were considerably fewer French
                    people in Niamey because there were not really any large commercial
                    opportunities. So the French community is relatively small and therefore the
                    presence is not all that visible. There are French companies but I would not say
                    that you get the impression of as mucFrench presence as I did when I was in
                    Abidjan which is a richer country and a commercial and financial center for West
                    Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Niger is largely Muslim?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Yes. Muslim.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And is a member of the Islamic Conference Organization, is
                        thawhat it is called?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: As I recall that is what it is called.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, let's turn to the United States embassy that you were the chief of
                    mission for. What did that consist of and, in general, what were United States
                    interests in Niger at the time that you went?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Well, I think that the interest of the United States in Niger at the
                    time was largely in the realm of promoting economic development and providing
                    humanitarian assistance. There was not, to be frank, much to do in the way of
                    promoting U.S. commercial interests because of the very poor economy and the
                    poor prospects for trade and investment-very modest prospects for trade and
                    investment. We had a very large AID mission; we had a fairly large Peace Corps
                    mission. And I would say the focus of our presence was largely on economic
                    development and humanitarian assistance.</p>
                <p>Q: What sort of sectors was AID involved with...mainly with the agriculture
                    area?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Agriculture and health.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Family planning?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I don't remember the details of that. I'm sure we were. But the focus
                    was on protection of the health of women and children and I think, in general,
                    basic health facilities for the population.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And in the agriculture area-we were involved in what?
                        Fertilizesupply, or...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: No. I think it was more largely to do with technical assistance to the
                    Ministry of Agriculture in order to increase its capabilities to provide
                    assistance to the farmers. A lot of the focus was, of course, on dry-land
                    agriculture and grains - trying to promote better cropping methods and better
                    seeds. And, to some extent, better use of fertilizer. But it was largely a
                    technical assistance effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And I'm sure that the World Bank and a number of other
                        donorwere active in Niger in the time you were there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Absolutely. Other donors were involved in agriculture and the World Bank
                    played a major role. Plus there is also an international agricultural research
                    institute located near to Niamey as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that institute-you say it was international-did it try
                        to dthings affecting the Sahel area in general or West Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: West Africa, the Sahel area. But in those international agriculture
                    research stations those results are shared world wide. It is just that they
                    happen to be located in different climate zones and different agriculture
                    zones.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the U.S. government or American citizens involved with
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Yes. There were American agricultural scientists associated with that
                    institute. And we also financed it indirectly through our work with the World
                    Bank.</p>
                <p>Q: You mentioned we also were involved in providing humanitarian assistance
                    related to the Sahel situation which had existed for some years before you got
                    there.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Humanitarian assistance essentially was in the agriculture area taking
                    the form of emergency food supplies when there were crop failures in Niger which
                    do occur periodically. There was no crisis while I was there on the same level
                    of magnitude as occurred in the early 1970s but there was a periodic need for
                    assistance. There was also a need for assistance, strangely enough, due to flash
                    floods. Extreme short, heavy rains washed away crops sometimes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were refugees coming into Niger from elsewhere or was
                        thiprimarily from within the country itself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Primarily within the country. Not a major refugeproblem. In fact, very
                    little refugee problem at all.</p>
                <p>Q: How about Peace Corps? You said it was a fairly sizeable presence of Peace
                    Corps volunteers. They were working in similar sectors - agriculture and
                    health?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Agriculture and health exactly. Also on the agricultural side involved
                    in environmental projects working, for example, on the planting of trees and
                    efforts to essentially protect the vegetation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We've talked about AID and Peace Corps. Were we involved
                        at alon the military assistance side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: We were. We had a small military assistance program which was the
                    remnant of a larger program which had been active a few years before. The origin
                    of that of course is the fact that Niger borders on Libya and the United States
                    wanted to have a close relationship with the Nigerian military and try to help
                    that small army maintain itself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Niger also borders on Chad. Was that another aspect of
                        oumilitary assistance-a concern about the situation in Chad?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I think of less concern.</p>
                <p>Q: The embassy itself was probably fairly small-a very large AID presence and
                    Peace Corps staff. Were there actually U.S. military personnel there?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Yes. On the embassy staff we had a major who was in chargof the Office
                    of Military Cooperation and a senior sergeant.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then we had a political officer or two or three?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And an economic officer or two?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: One. The economic officer also did consular work.</p>
                <p>Q: But consular work was probably fairly limited because there weren't very many
                    American citizens other than those part of...</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Most of the American citizens were in the official mission if you
                    include Peace Corps in that. And also, however, there were a couple of hundred
                    American missionaries; because it is a poor country it has attracted the
                    interest of missionary groups.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there also representatives of
                        non-governmenorganizations-American based NGO's?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Working under contract for AID we had CARE, and there was the African
                    Development Foundation and some other AID contractors. So we had a fairly
                    substantial presence...focused as I said, on development assistance and
                    humanitarian assistance. And you are right. The consular workload was not heavy
                    because not many Nigerians can afford to travel. So we didn't have that much of
                    a request for travel visas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the ones that you did get were probably to a
                        considerablextent government officials.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Or financed by scholarships paid for by perhaps AID or by the USIA. We
                    had a public affairs officer with a small staff. We had a cultural center which
                    was located at that time in downtown Niamey.</p>
                <p>Q: In terms of your own responsibility, I assume since it was a fairly isolated
                    post in the interior of Africa - that the morale of the mission community and
                    families was pretty important. You and your wife probably spent quite a bit of
                    time in that area encouraging people to feel comfortable, dealing with issues
                    and problems that came up.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>CUNDIFF: We spent a lot of time in that area and I think very successfully. That
                    is my personal assessment of it. We entertained as often as we could, all
                    members of the official community. Invited into our house all the visiting AID
                    experts who came through. And we entertained Nigerian officials quite
                    substantially in our home and we traveled. My wife and I traveled throughout
                    Niger and wherever we traveled we visited the Peace Corps volunteers. We usually
                    took them some food if we had some to take at that time. We would have dinner
                    with them in their respective villages or cities and it was a very, shall I say,
                    personally very satisfying assignment from that perspective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A place like that is very “hands on.” You get out into the
                        dusand on the roads.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Absolutely. You travel for miles in a very arid climate in terrain that
                    looks something like maybe parts of Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah - that
                    sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Only more so.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Even more so. Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the residence that is provided for the ambassador
                        waadequate for all of these purposes that you have been describing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: We made it adequate. It was not a large house perhaps by some peoples
                    standards. But it was quite large enough for us and, because it is dry there,
                    you can usually entertain outdoors without worrying about rain for most of the
                    year. So we had opportunity to entertain on the lawn and the terrace behind the
                    house. It is a very attractive residence overlooking the Niger River. And people
                    were always very pleased to be invited.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you felt that morale was good in the community and
                        thmission?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Yes, I think it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that was obviously important.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I think it was. We had a very active community. There was a lot of
                    attention on soft ball games, sports and so on. We opened up the tennis courts
                    at the residence for people to play on. Our swimming pool was available for
                    people to use. We just had a very active, participatory community.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>Q: One of my regrets of my time in Ghana, which overlapped to some extent with
                    yours, was that while I played softball and like softball a lot, it took us
                    awhile to get organized internationally and the only two tournaments we went to
                    were in nearby Lom� in Togo and Ouagadougou. But we never got to Niamey. But my
                    successor twice removed has just written to me recently saying that he has just
                    came back from Niamey where they won. The Accra team won the softball tournament
                    which I think was over Columbus Day weekend in October.</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: It is a tradition. It is the WAIST (the West African International
                    Softball Tournament). It has a lot to do with morale in that part of the world
                    for us.</p>
                <p>Q: Tell me about what some of your political objectives were with the government.
                    Were you at that time trying to encourage elections, political parties, opening
                    up of the political system or were we primarily looking for Niger to play a role
                    internationally in the United Nations and perhaps in other areas as well?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I would say that the democratization process was becoming more important
                    during the time that I was there. A lot of that was going on under its own
                    momentum without benefit of any foreign advice particularly. As you may recall,
                    there were national conferences being called in a number of West African
                    countries. Niamey, Niger rather, began to want to have a National Conference.
                    There was one just as I was getting ready to leave Niamey at the end of my
                    assignment. But the process of moving from a single party to multiple party
                    elections, that process was entrained as I left Niger. Obviously it was
                    something that we were in favor of, but we did not have to be really involved in
                    the encouraging process which was already well underway of its own momentum.</p>
                <p>Q: Where would you give credit for that momentum? Was it strictly within the
                    country? Or were they looking at examples elsewhere? Were they getting advice or
                    encouragement from France or...?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I think the encouragement for the democratization process was going on
                    in a number of other African countries at the time. I think the examples were
                    really coming from Africa and from other countries which they were looking
                    closely at. And I think there was a general desire to democratize and that
                    process was well launched. And we were involved in helping out in certain ways
                    with small assistance projects. We had earlier sent-before I had arrived there
                    even - we had provided financing for an American constitutional expert to visit
                    Niger and to help them with one of their constitutions at that particular time.
                    So the process was well launched and I think the USIA visitor program also
                    probably played some positive role because people were able to visit the United
                    States and look at our elections and look at our process and our way of
                    government and so on. In effect we were having an influence through our rather
                    substantial technical assistance projects which had brought many Nigerians to
                    the United States where they became familiar inevitably with our particular
                    system.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So our impact was positive and perhaps in ways that we
                        can't bsure about but we can't take credit for...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: No. I don't think so. I think that what you were seeing perhaps is the
                    payoff of a long period of international relations and contact through cultural
                    programs, through the USIA visitor program, and through the AID scholarships and
                    other supports. Even through the military assistance training program which
                    brought officers to the United States for training.</p>
                <p>But I don't think you can, as you say, point to any particular event as being
                    determining. I think the process at that time, of democratization was moving
                    forward on its own. It was supported by students, by labor unions, supported by
                    civil servants, perhaps less so by military officers inevitably. But there was a
                    big momentum for democratization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was security a major consideration, a major issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Security was of two concerns. One, I was in Niger during the war with
                    Iraq, the Gulf War. And I was concerned about protecting the American community
                    from any spillover from what was going on in Iraq. And the other form of
                    security concern had to do with domestic instability because there were clashes
                    that occurred as part of the democratization process. You had students and the
                    unions demonstrating and you had the police clashing, at least one time I
                    remember, with the students and the unions. There was that sort of thing. So you
                    had instability in the city of Niamey related to domestic politics.</p>
                <p>Q: I know neighboring Mali has had a problem in the northern part of the country
                    over the years with...is it the Tuaregs? Is that a problem also in Niger?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: The Tuaregs are one of the eight ethnic groups as I recall in Niger. You
                    know the largest ethnic group is the Hausa. The next largest is probably the
                    Zarma and then the Fulani and so on and smaller groups. But the Tuaregs are a
                    very important part of the population in the northern part of the country...the
                    drier part in the Sahara Desert and in the south, even up to Niamey itself.
                    Throughout the country now many of them have come out of the desert and gone to
                    the cities to metropolitan areas. Yes, the Tuaregs because of their nomadic,
                    traditional life have difficulties sometimes dealing with sedentary societies.
                    And there were, while I was there, there were some acts - illegal acts - by
                    Tuareg groups on police stations. And in turn the military went chasing these
                    people across the desert and inflicted damage on them. So there were, from our
                    perspective, concerns about human rights violations and abuses of power by
                    authorities in their response to the problems with the Tuaregs.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some elements?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Some elements, yes. And this is complicated by the fact that Tuaregs are
                    present also in Libya and Algeria and in Northern Mali.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there activity by the Libyans in Niger? While they have a common
                    boundary/border, it is obviously right in the middle of the Sahara Desert so it
                    is not a very populated area in either country.</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Well, I couldn't address what Libya's exact activities are; the visible
                    presence of Libya is the embassy. They have an embassy. In fact they built a
                    brand new embassy in Niamey while I was there. While I was there they had an
                    accredited ambassador to Niger and they invited to Libya the head of state of
                    Niger as well as other neighboring heads of state. So there was an exchange of
                    Libyan officials and Nigerian officials and I think that there was always some
                    concern about the fact that many young Tuareg men had gone up into Libya seeking
                    employment and had been influenced perhaps by their stay in Libya. And then
                    later they would come back to Niger and that would present sometimes a question
                    for the local authorities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Besides Libya, France and the United States, did a number
                        oother countries have resident embassies in Niamey?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: The diplomatic community in Niamey was small. The foreign aid
                    organizations were quite present - the United Nations, the World Bank, the Food
                    and Agricultural Organization and a number of UN related agencies were there. On
                    the bilateral side, we had France, and the United States. From Western Europe,
                    we had Germany and Belgium with active embassies. We had a number of Muslim, or
                    Islamic country ambassadors there. Especially from North Africa - Algeria,
                    Tunisia, Libya. Also Egypt. Saudi Arabia had a charg� d'affaires. Pakistan had a
                    charg� d'affaires.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Russia. The Soviet Union was represented by an ambassadoand a small

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Japan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Japan was represented by an ambassador in Abidjan. They had no office in
                    Niger. The Japanese ambassador would periodically visit as would the ambassadors
                    of most of the other developed countries but they would usually come from
                    Abidjan.</p>
                <p>Q: I seem to recall the name of a person from Niger who has been mentioned as a
                    possible candidate to replace Boutros Boutros-Ghali as United Nations Secretary
                    General. Somebody that is connected with the Islamic Conference
                    Organization.</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: That is right.</p>
                <p>Q: Was this the person who was maybe Foreign Minister when you were there?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: No. That person is Algabid. While I was in Niger, he was located most of
                    the time in Saudi Arabia because he was the executive director of the
                    Organization of Islamic States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is obviously a very significant position I would
                        thinwithin the Islamic world.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Yes. He had formerly been a minister in several governments in Niger,
                    including at one time, maybe even briefly, Prime Minister.</p>
                <p>Q: Does Niger see itself as trying to play a significant role in the world? I
                    mean it had obviously got a lot of problems of its own but perhaps can make a
                    contribution. They are in the United Nations and all these other organizations.
                    Do they participate in UN Peace keeping or other activities like that?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Yes. Niger has participated in the Gulf War for example. They sent a
                    small contingent to Saudi Arabia. And they have most recently, this is since
                    I've been there of course, offered to I think participate in the ECOWAS military
                    activity in Liberia. So they do periodically participate in peacekeeping
                    efforts. They have to find some external financial support in order to make that
                    possible. They do not have a large military and therefore they can't really send
                    very large contingents. But usually they send a regiment. They are active in the
                    United Nations and other international organizations. But I think Niger's role
                    is limited by its limited financial resources.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you persuade them to send a unit to Saudi Arabia at
                        the timof the Gulf War to participate in the coalition?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I wish I could take credit for that but the truth of the matter is Niger
                    offered to do that, I think, largely as a result of consultations with Saudi
                    Arabia. The French ambassador and I were informed of Niger's intentions and, of
                    course, the Nigerians indicated a desire for as much support as possible. But in
                    the end, as I recall, they worked out arrangements with Saudi Arabia - details
                    of which I don't know. They were responding essentially to a longstanding
                    friendship with Saudi Arabia. As I said, the Saudi's had always maintained a
                    diplomatic presence in Niger, plus they had given some assistance to Niger from
                    time to time in helping building of mosques and that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>Q: People sometimes, who are trying to reduce expenditures or perhaps reduce the
                    United States presence or role in the world are critical of having an embassy or
                    a lot of programs in a place like Niger. How would you, looking back, assess
                    overall the role of the American embassy - having a resident United States
                    ambassador and some of these other programs? Do you feel that they are making a
                    contribution and contributing to the United States interests and objectives?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Well, I think that from my perspective, it is useful to have an
                    ambassador in even a relatively, what shall I say, relatively small mission such
                    as Niamey. I think that an ambassador's presence gives an overall sense of
                    cohesion and identification-central identification to the U.S. presence. It is
                    the ambassador, if you will, who personifies the pulling together of the entire
                    U.S. presence - whatever that might be. Having an ambassador is very important
                    to the host country, a small country like Niger or small, economically at
                    least.</p>
                <p>I think they put a lot of emphasis on having an ambassador with whom they can
                    have an official dialogue when there is any issue at stake. Whether it be a vote
                    in the United Nations or activities such as we had in the Gulf War or whatever.
                    It is important to have that ambassador around as a person that they can have a
                    dialogue with. I also think that the ambassador's presence perhaps is an ideal
                    way of pulling together different agencies of the U.S. government so that you
                    have coordination of AID and the military assistance if there is any, Peace
                    Corps if there is any, information and cultural programs of the USIA and so on.
                    That is sort of a general response reflecting, I guess, my own particular
                    bias.</p>
                <p>It is true that you could provide this ambassadorial dialogue with a country
                    through a regional presence. You could have an American ambassador, for example,
                    in Abidjan also accredited in Niamey as many of our Western friends do have. We
                    also talked about the Japanese ambassador coming up for a visit from Abidjan to
                    Niamey. You could have that kind of arrangement but in my personal opinion, I
                    think you inevitably dilute the bilateral relationship because an ambassador in
                    Abidjan who also has responsibilities for the American embassy or presence in
                    Niamey is going to be stretched pretty thin. And inevitably, I think, the
                    bilateral relationship will become less close.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>Q: Will be stretched thin and also won't have the ease of access and contact that
                    one develops on a very regular basis where see the president or whoever not just
                    when you need to deal with a problem or when you happen to visit. But you see
                    him at functions and events and people come to know you and have confidence in
                    you. Certainly the regional ambassadors I've seen from other countries work hard
                    at it but it they don't see to be or can't be as effective as somebody who is
                    present on the scene.</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I think that is right. And I think also one has to take into account the
                    fact that the United States is a global power, maybe arguably the only one right
                    now. And if you are going to be a global power and a global leader it is
                    probably in your interest to try to have a direct bilateral diplomatic presence
                    at the ambassadorial level just about everywhere in the world. You do not, I
                    would argue, need to have necessarily a large supporting staff for such an
                    ambassador.</p>
                <p>And I think one can argue that the United States presence can perhaps be
                    diminished in lots of posts including one such as Niamey given the changes that
                    have occurred in our own interests and in the way world events have developed.
                    And to give you an example of that today, we no longer have a military
                    assistance cooperation program in Niamey. We are in the process of closing the
                    AID mission. We maintain a USIA presence and we maintain a strong Peace Corps
                    presence but frankly, even since I've left Niamey; it hasn't been that long
                    ago...1991 - five years later...there have been reasons why these reductions in
                    our presence have taken place that have to do with more recent developments
                    which I won't go into in our bilateral relationship. But the fact is that we
                    have substantially diminished our presence since I was there. And diplomatic
                    dialogue continues. But we have an ambassador. And I think that in my judgement
                    is important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A person accredited to that government with that title
                        makes big difference...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...in terms of your ability to conduct that dialogue
                        ancommunicate effectively.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: That is correct.</p>
                <p>Q: Okay. It sounds like you enjoyed your assignment there and have several things
                    to be proud of. Is there anything else we should say about the three years you
                    were there until you finished your term in 1991? Pretty well covers it?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I think so, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came back to the State Department and what did you do
                        then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I went back into the Bureau of Economic and Commercial Affairs-my third
                    assignment in EB. This time I was a special negotiator for transportation
                    affairs. It is a senior level position working very closely with the Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary for Transportation Affairs. My responsibilities there were
                    to supervise three offices dealing with aviation negotiations, aviation policy
                    other than aviation negotiations, the maritime and land transport policies. And
                    I spent a good deal of my time focusing, however, on bilateral civil aviation
                    negotiations with France, Japan, Netherlands, Israel, Austria, Belgium, Ireland,
                    Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Thailand.</p>
                <p>Q: And these were negotiations involving access and routes. Of course this was a
                    time of deregulation of the U.S. aviation industry. That obviously made a
                    difference because you were mainly dealing with state owned airlines in most of
                    these other countries.</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: In many instances.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or single carriers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Yes. That's right. In many instances.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So would your delegation actually have representatives of
                        severadifferent American airlines?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: The composition of our delegations to these negotiations actually
                    changed during that four year period. I might say that the government team has
                    remained the same. Which is to say that the State Department and the U.S.
                    Department of Transportation constitute the core elements of our negotiating
                    team. The State Department has the lead negotiating authority but the Department
                    of Transportation provides critical expertise and senior level
                    participation.</p>
                <p>We also have lawyers, sometimes from both the State Department and Department of
                    Transportation. Always a lawyer on the delegations. And we are accompanied to
                    these negotiations by the U.S. private aviation sector. When I first started
                    negotiating we had four representatives of private aviation. These were
                    association representatives. And we had the Air Transport Association. We had
                    NACA, which is the National Air Carriers Association. We had a representative of
                    the AFL-CIO which in this case was a representative of the Airline Pilots
                    Association. And my memory is failing me...there was another association
                    representation, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the carriers were not directly...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Oh...the Airports Council International. The Association of U.S.
                    Airports would be present. So we had unions, airports and carriers - both large
                    carriers and small carriers including charter carriers as well passenger
                    carriers.</p>
                <p>Q: I assume the most difficult and important negotiation you were involved with
                    was probably with Japan. Would United Airlines or Northwest actually be
                    observing, be present?</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: Yes. And I was going to say that things changed while I was there in
                    that position. We always had carriers present if we were having a negotiation
                    simply dealing with one carrier's problems. And in fact with Japan, I was the
                    leader of our negotiations, our discussions with Japan over a route problem with
                    Northwest Airlines. And when I did negotiate with Japan, Northwest Airlines was
                    behind me in the room and able to give me advice and counsel as appropriate from
                    time to time. Later on at some point a decision was made to broaden even further
                    the participation in these negotiations of U.S. carriers and eventually I think
                    during the last year or two I was in the job we had carriers, in addition to
                    their association representatives, carrier representatives, directly in the room
                    with us - such as American Airlines, Northwest Airlines, Continental Airlines,
                    United Airlines and so on. So we conducted negotiations with quite a group of
                    observers and, if you will, advisors, from the private sector.</p>
                <p>Q: I think we are pretty well at the end. I don't know if there is anything
                    further we should say about this activity. It went on for several years and I'm
                    sure there were lots of interesting wrinkles in the individual negotiations but
                    for this purpose maybe this is a good point to stop.</p>
                <p>CUNDIFF: I would say that in that position, one of my great pleasures was not
                    only working with U.S. private aviation in negotiations but also I was involved
                    within APEC - the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum - in setting up and
                    establishing and expanding the transportation working group of that
                    organization. And that was quite satisfying.</p>
