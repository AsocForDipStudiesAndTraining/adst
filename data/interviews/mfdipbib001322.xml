                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Bob (Charles R.) Beecham, on November 18, 2002. I
                        am speaking with Paul P. Blackburn III about his 40 year career, from
                        September 1962 to September 2002, first with the U.S. Information Agency and
                        then with the State Department after it absorbed USIA on October 1,
                        1999.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEFORE JOINING USIA IN 1962</p>
                <p>Let's begin with this questiohow did it happen that you joined USIA, and what
                    were you doing before that?</p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: I was at Haverford College when I got interested in the Foreign
                    Service. At that time, my dad, who was a career naval officer, was serving in
                    Okinawa. I went there two summers, after my sophomore and junior years. Japan
                    was fascinating to me, and I thought, gosh, maybe I could find a career that
                    would take me to Japan, give me a chance to study Japanese, and even pay me to
                    live there. I was fortunate at Haverford College that our president, Hugh
                    Borton, was a great Japan scholar. He had been the director of the East Asian
                    Institute at Columbia, and gave me a lot of his time, even letting me take a
                    special reading course under his tutelage. I took the Foreign Service exam for
                    the first time while at Haverford. I easily passed the written part, but flubbed
                    the oral.</p>
                <p>Thwarted in my first attempt to get into the Foreign Servicwhich I now realize
                    would have been nuts to take me in at that stage of my lifI went on to do
                    graduate work at the School of Advanced International Studies, or SAIS, at Johns
                    Hopkins. While there I again took the Foreign Service exam, and failed the oral
                    for a second time. The examiners told me that I needed “more seasoning,” by
                    which they essentially meant that I needed to grow up. I was 22 at the time, and
                    looked 18. They strongly urged me to go into the military, saying that the
                    Foreign Service particularly needed more officers with military experience. I
                    didn't follow that advice, but instead gave the test a third try, this time the
                    one specifically for USIA, and finally passed.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>I was delighted to get into USIA, having been strongly encouraged by my professor
                    at SAIS, Paul Linebarger, a China specialist who was also something of a psywar
                    expert of that erand by graduate school pal Gordon Tubbs, who had joined USIA's
                    research arm and later headed its East Asia division. While waiting for my
                    appointment I took a course at American University on “International
                    Communication” given by USIA Training Division stalwart Charles “Chuck” Vetter,
                    so even before coming on board I had built up a lot of enthusiasm for what I was
                    getting into.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But what about before that? According to the stud book,
                        you were at Brookings and at the Library of Congress.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: I did one research project at the Brookings Institution, under the
                    direction, as it happened, of Murray Lawson, who was for many years the USIA
                    Historian. Then from the summer of 1961 until the week before I joined USIA in
                    1962, I was the Analyst for Far Eastern Affairs in the Legislative Reference
                    Service at the Library of Congress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did it happen that you were at the Library of
                        Congress?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: I tried to get through SAIS in just one year, instead of the two years
                    normally required. I didn't quite finish it, and had only one more course to
                    take. In that second year, and not being a full-time SAIS student, I landed the
                    job at the Legislative Reference Service, where they needed an analyst to
                    prepare reports for committees and Members of Congress on subjects relating to
                    East Asia. Currently, the Congressional Research Office, which replaced LRS, has
                    a team of East Asia specialists, but at that time I was the only one, and hardly
                    a specialist, doing the job. I wrote several reports on Vietnam, where during
                    those early years of the Kennedy administration our involvement was getting
                    deeper and deeper. I also prepared a speec“draft remarks,” it was
                    euphemistically calleon the U.S. involvement in South Korea, a background paper
                    on U.S.-Japan relations since the end of the war, position papers on both sides
                    of a Philippine war claims issue, and of course materials on various aspects of
                    what to do about the problem of “Red China.” The workload was heavy and the
                    deadlines often ridiculously tight, but I learned to write under pressurand just
                    produce the best possible on-time product given the constraints placed on
                    me.</p>
                <p>OVERVIEW OF USIA/STATE PUBLIC DIPLOMACY CAREER</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, now, looking back on 40 years with the Agency, why
                        don't you just say something briefly about what was typical in your
                        experience and what was sort of unique?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>BLACKBURN: In the typical categorI came in, like other entry-level officers who
                    joined the Agency in those days, as a Foreign Service Career Reserve Officer.
                    They had not yet established a permanent Foreign Service officer corps for USIA,
                    and didn't want to call us FSOs. I started at the very bottom, as an FSCR-8
                    Junior Officer Trainee and worked my way up through the ranks. We all had to be
                    under 31. The womefour of the 20 in my entering clashad to be unmarried.
                    Compared to today's intake, most of us were quite inexperiencein both life and
                    overseas exposure. I had been married a little over a year; our first daughter
                    was born ten days after I entered USIA. The welcome our new crop of officers got
                    was very warm. We all received much individual attention and special mentoring
                    from trainers, personnel officers, and area offices.</p>
                <p>There were many aspects of my career that were atypical, however. For example, I
                    got nearly every job I ever competed for, a streak of good luck that undoubtedly
                    contributed to my nearly consistently high morale throughout those many years.
                    When I joined the Agency I said I strongly preferred to work in Asia, even
                    though I recognized that I was “worldwide available” and had to have a secondary
                    as well as a primary area. As it turned out, I spent all my overseas year24
                    years wortin just four Asian posts, in each of which I had the privilege of
                    serving as Public Affairs Officer: Malaysia, Thailand, Japan and China.</p>
                <p>Also unusual was the fact that I was never a Cultural Affairs Officer or
                    Information Officeor Executive Officer, for that matter. I served as an
                    assistant or deputy only twice.</p>
                <p>I had tremendous good fortune at critical times, as well. When I got fired from a
                    job I'll be talking about later, powerful colleagues came to my rescue and saved
                    my career. That was when I was Associate Director of the Bureau of Educational
                    and Cultural Affairs in USIA. Later on in Japan, just when I thought my career
                    was coming to an end, the Agency sent me an out-of-the-blue offer to go to China
                    as PAO. Another stroke of luck made it possible for me to retire as a Career
                    Minister from the State Department at the maximum age of 65. Had there been no
                    consolidation of USIA, I would have had to retire for “time in class” a couple
                    of years earlier, as the TIC period for CMs in USIA was only four years, but
                    seven years in State.</p>
                <p>My 40-year career stands, I believe, as the longest for continuous public affairs
                    or public diplomacy service in our history. And it is unlikely anyone will
                    surpass my record now that consolidation has taken place, as advancement to the
                    top ranks requires assignments outside of the public diplomacy tracfor example
                    as Consul General, DCM or Ambassador. So my career was atypical in that regard
                    as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, at this point, why don't you briefly just establish
                        chronologically, from the beginning, your various assignments?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>BLACKBURN: I entered USIA in September of 1962 and went through the JOT program
                    in Washington, with half a year of basic training and half a year of Thai
                    language study. I was a Junior Officer Trainee in Bangkok, 1963-64, and an
                    Assistant Cultural Affairs Officer from 1964 well into 1965. I went up to Khon
                    Kaen in northeast Thailand as Branch Public Affairs Officer in 1965-67, and then
                    to Udorn as BPAO in 1967-68.</p>
                <p>In 1968 I returned to Washington for the Phase II program, which provided more
                    training for junior officers, for three years. The first year was basic
                    rotational training, followed by a year as Special Assistant to the area
                    director in charge of East Asia and the Pacific. The last year was spent in
                    Japanese language training in Washington, after which I took the second year in
                    Yokohama. From 1972 to 1975 I served as Director of the USIS Tokyo American
                    Center. I went back to Washington to be an Agency inspector for two years,
                    1975-77. Then I was a Senior Policy Officer at USIA 1977-78, and from 1978-80
                    headed what was called the Fast Policy Guidance Unit. I served as PAO in
                    Malaysia in 1980-84, followed by another four year stint as PAO Thailand,
                    1984-88. I was assigned back in Washington as Area Director for Africa for a
                    year, after which I was made the Deputy Associate Director of the Bureau of
                    Educational and Cultural Affairs, the so-called E bureau in USIA, a job I held
                    in 1989-90.</p>
                <p>During 1990-92 I was at Georgetown University's Institute for the Study of
                    Diplomacy in the School of Foreign Service, before going to Japan as PAO in
                    1992-96. That assignment was followed by a year in Washington for Chinese
                    language study before becoming PAO in Beijing in 1997-2000. On returning to
                    Washington for my last assignment, I was Director of the Office of Public
                    Diplomacy in the Bureau of East Asia and Pacific Affairs until I retired at the
                    end of September, 2002.</p>
                <p>JOT IN WASHINGTO1962-63</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Please go back now and talk about your JOT training at the
                        outset of all of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: It was very exciting joining the Agency in those heady Kennedy years.
                    Edward R. Murrow was USIA Director and we basked in his reflected glory. Many of
                    the men in my JOT class of 20 ended up having long and very successful
                    careerpeople like Len Baldyga and Sam Courtney. Marjorie Marriley Ransom was one
                    of our stars, who left to get married, but returned in style and eventually
                    became a Career Minister. Two from that class, Barry Ballou and Mary Fattu
                    Ashley, switched to the civil service and are still working in public diplomacy
                    for the State Department.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>Our JOT years were a time when men were encouraged to get married, if they hadn't
                    already done so. We were told that the most effective Foreign Service officers
                    were men with spouses and children, because that's how to get more deeply into
                    the local society. The women officers, however, were forced to resign if they
                    wanted to get married. It was strongly hoped that they would marry male FSOs. In
                    that case the Foreign Service would gain the services of two professionals at
                    the cost of only one salarthe ideal “two for one” situation, they said. Anne
                    Hannehan Oman and Marjorie Marriley Ransom both married FSOs, but only the
                    latter put in many years as an unpaid Foreign Service spouse.</p>
                <p>Gays and lesbians were presumed not to be present in our ranks, having been
                    screened out by the rigorous background security investigation. It was, in
                    short, a much less enlightened Foreign Service than we see today.</p>
                <p>Another bizarre feature of our profession in those days was that we all got at
                    least two annual performance evaluations. Those of us who were married got four
                    of them. The first was an open report describing our strengths and correctable
                    failings. The second dealt more candidly with our performance, using language
                    that did not have to be shared with the rated officer. Similar reports, both
                    open and secret, were done on our wives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And who would be writing these?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Your supervisor in the field would do them. These were the conditions
                    of employment. This was the climate of the Foreign Service that we came into,
                    and the sort of thing that we (and our spouses) had to accept. In the JOT
                    training, we started with about ten weeks that overlapped with State Department
                    colleagues in the A-100 course. Otherwise, it was an Agency design. Much
                    emphasis was put on what we now call American studies. We talked at great length
                    about U.S. society, our system of government, American ideals, that sort of
                    thing. The training, much of it led by my old professor Chuck Vetter, stressed
                    the importance of being able to out-argue our foreign critics. We were to
                    imagine ourselves facing a hostile audience of Indian students who would make
                    virulent anti-American statements and put us on the defensive. We were expected
                    to be able to give as well as we goeloquently defending everything from the
                    American way of life to our foreign policy positions.</p>
                <p>This was also the counter-insurgency period. We had many sessions on that as
                    well, using books such as one called The Ugly American, by Burdick and Lederer.
                    We had to prepare ourselves to be culturally sensitive field officers capable of
                    interacting effectively with villagers who were getting regular doses of
                    communist propaganda. If we couldn't play the guitar or sing folk songs, like
                    the hero of that book, too bad. At least we should be able to make a good
                    impression for our country and show the poor people of the developing countries
                    that “the free world,” not communism, offered them greatest hope for a better
                    future.</p>

                <p>The Agency took much pride in its films in those days. Some were indeed
                    excellent, and deserved the awards they were given. The account of the Kennedy
                    presidency called “Years of Lightning, Day of Drums,” which came out after the
                    1963 assassination, was particularly memorable. As JOTs we watched many films,
                    discussing at length not only their content but also how we would best use them
                    with mass audiences abroad. And we were all trained to use a 16-millimeter
                    projector. That skill actually did come in quite handy for many of us, but gave
                    Embassy colleagues the mistaken impression that USIS officers were proficient
                    with all AV equipment.</p>
                <p>The training was episodically exciting and even fun, but I think we all were
                    itchy to get to work. It really was a long grind, being trained for a year in
                    Washington and then another one as a JOT overseas before you could get a
                    responsible job all your own. After the general JOT Washington training, I was
                    given six months of Thai language training at FSI. That was a most challenging
                    experience. I was very, very intimidated at the beginning. I had major doubts
                    that I would ever be able to master the Thai tones. I worked for hours and hours
                    on those damn tapes, and found it extremely hard going. Eventually, however, I
                    began to feel that I could actually distinguish between the sounds, and that
                    people listening to me were beginning to be able to make out what I was trying
                    to convey. Probably nothing in my entire career gave me more satisfaction than
                    reaching S-4 in Thai by the end of that first overseas tour. I also got to the
                    3+ level in reading, having made out-of-class use of a book called “Teach
                    Yourself to Read Thai.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did what you learned in training actually apply when you
                        hit the ground in Thailand? Not only the language study, but other aspects
                        of the training as well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Yes, it did pretty well. The Thai training, though devoted in part to
                    some very high class, even courtly, language, helped me communicate
                    appropriately with ranking officials I dealt with when once in Thailand. But
                    mostly it was essential for giving me control over the tones and the basic
                    grammar. As for the other parts of the training, some was quite pertinent,
                    particularly that part which dealt with counter-insurgency and working on the
                    ground in Southeast Asia. On the other hand, I never had to face an audience of
                    hostile Indian students, and not a word was said about how to handle two major
                    responsibilities I faced in my first years in Thailand: running a teenage
                    exchange program and promoting troop-community relations at an overseas U.S.
                    base. And much of the American studies emphasis was unnecessary; as it consisted
                    of basic information we had been tested on in the Foreign Service exam.</p>

                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Thailand was a mind boggling and growing-up experience for me. When I
                    first got there, I was younjust 2and pretty callow, which is another way of
                    saying immature. But I was extremely lucky to spend my first tour in the company
                    of some really great officers. The Executive Officer, Russ Cox, told me, quite
                    accurately, that never again in my career would I serve with so many outstanding
                    officers. USIS Thailand at the time was led by an extraordinary PAO named Jack
                    O'Brien, who had an amazing ability to command those of us who served under him.
                    Though I thought he was an old-timer, actually he was then only in his early to
                    mid-forties.</p>
                <p>I think I learned the bulk of whatever public affairs “tradecraft” I ever learned
                    in the Foreign Service during that tour. Many senior and mid-level officers were
                    generous with their time, and directly or indirectly taught me valuable lessons.
                    For example, from Jack O'Brien I learned the importance of thinking through what
                    you're trying to do so carefully that you can articulate it in ways that
                    everybody on your staff will understand. Jack stressed that every part of the
                    PAO's operation deserves attention and respecand that meant it should be
                    periodically critiqued in systematic fashion. His policy of keeping an “open
                    door” to all staffers was also an excellent example.</p>
                <p>From you, Bob Beecham, the USIS Thailand Press Officer in those days, I learned
                    the importance of being persnickety about how things look in writing, especially
                    when they deal with U.S. policy and are to be shared with the public. You taught
                    me not to accept, from oneself or from anyone else, a written product that does
                    not meet the highest standards.</p>
                <p>From Jack Zeller, who was an Assistant Cultural Affairs Officer, I learned that
                    “there is always plenty of money.” Don't worry about financial constraints, he
                    taught me, or you will think too small. If something needs to be done, and you
                    have a good idea, then go look for the funding, either from the post's assets or
                    some other source. You are likely to get it. He stressed that responsible
                    creativity is an essential quality for a first-class USIS officer.</p>
                <p>From Howard Biggerstaff, who was later my boss in the field program, I learned
                    that careful planning is extremely importanand can be great fun, too. He showed
                    me that thinking through the component parts of a complex and ambitious plan,
                    explaining it to others and getting their inputs, and finally seeing your
                    concept reach fruition brings a special sense of satisfactioespecially for USIA
                    officers who have such a rich plate of resources to work with. “Bigg” worked
                    indefatigably to plan the USIS Thailand field program that we all carried out
                    during those years. Later on in my career, when enthusiastically involved in one
                    complex scheme or another, I would fondly remember the zest of Jack Zeller and
                    Bigg as they worked on similar projects.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>From Bob Lasher, then the formal head of USIS Thailand field operations, I
                    learned of the pleasures of visiting Thai villages. Even before leaving
                    Washington I had read many of Bob's widely-distributed reports on USIS-supported
                    Mobile Information Team (MIT) trips to sensitive villages in the northeast.
                    Besides assisting the senior Thai officials on the team, Bob would have a grand
                    time of it in the eveningdrinking, eating exotic foods, and even taking part in
                    traditional folk dancing. In other words, winning hearts and minds just like the
                    “Ugly American.”</p>
                <p>In Rob Nevitt, who was the Branch PAO up in Ubol, I saw an exemplary communicator
                    in action. Rob was an officer who made maximum use of his limited Thai and his
                    extraordinary gift for empathy to add an extra depth to his relations with both
                    Thais and Americans. I tried, then and latealbeit with limited succesto emulate
                    Rob's thoughtful and respectful approach to interpersonal relations.</p>
                <p>As a JOT assignment, I was tasked with preparing a brochure on the post. I went
                    to every section and talked to them about what they did, looked for pictures,
                    and drafted the text. The resulting briefing brochure was very useful in telling
                    Washington, the rest of the Mission, and others what USIS Thailand was all about
                    at that time. That was a great training exercise. I think the idea might have
                    come originally from the Deputy PAO, Ken McCormac, another of my kind and
                    helpful mentors. At that time Ken and Cultural Affairs Officer Nelson Spinks,
                    along with Jack Zeller, were the Thai hands at the post.</p>
                <p>In those first years in Thailand, I was trying to fit in and find my role as a
                    USIS officer. There was a lot of internal social activity, much of it very male
                    oriented. Once a week we had a poker game, and another night was set aside for
                    bowling. We often ended up going to bars and drinking heavily. I often went with
                    Jerry Tryon, an Assistant Radio-TV Officer and good friend. The carousing is not
                    something I feel proud of in retrospect, but it was fun at the time and
                    definitely part of the USIS Thailand culture of that era.</p>
                <p>One of my most enjoyable JOT experiences came when I visited USIS Chiang Mai, to
                    see how that branch post operated under BPAO Jerry Kyle. It was the time of the
                    Songkran water festival, and I had a grand time joining the other revelers in
                    the mass water fight. I think it was the most fun I had ever had in my life up
                    to that time.</p>

                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>BLACKBURN: I believe it was Jack Zeller who came up with the brilliant idea of
                    starting a large-scale American Field Service high school exchange program with
                    Thailand. He got it up and running before I took it over. I was a complete
                    neophyte actually, but took to it with gusto, applying energies pent-up from the
                    two long years of JOT relatively passive traineeship. AFS, a two way exchange
                    effort, offered the U.S. a way to reach out to the young people of Thailand and
                    make friends for America, particularly those who showed the most promise in the
                    provinces. USIA was giving strong financial support to the national AFS
                    organization headquartered in New York anyway, and Jack just decided USIS should
                    initiate a start-up program that could eventually evolve into a proper non-USG
                    AFS-Thailand office.</p>
                <p>When I became AFS director in 1964, we had just sent off 89 students to the
                    States, and the 14 “pioneers” from the first group had just come back. We were
                    preparing to send another 160, two thirds of them from the northeast or other
                    regions outside of Bangkok. This was a mammoth undertaking, and the kids were
                    carefully screened through a series of written and oral tests. The responsible
                    FSN, Khun Amphorn Komes, and I worked closely with high schools, education
                    offices, and Thai and American English teachers throughout the country. We were
                    supported by Jack Zeller, then in another job in Bangkok but serving as the “AFS
                    godfather,” and scores of volunteers who helped with interviews, our two-week
                    final orientation program, and the constant search for Thai families to host
                    American AFSers. Responsible Americans involved in the program had to visit each
                    selected Thai student to assess what kind of a home life he or she came from, in
                    order to help AFS New York find a compatible American receiving family.</p>
                <p>Q: Who would do these interviews?</p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Americans and Thais would. This was one of the pluses of the job for
                    me. I really liked doing the home interviews, even on miserably hot weekend
                    afternoons. We would go into the homes and ask personal questions that gave us
                    unique insights into Thai families, asking about living arrangements, space and
                    privacy, family activities, the role of Buddhism in their lives, and how mucif
                    anythinthey could afford to pay toward the cost to send their student to the
                    U.S. for a yeathe maximum being $450, if I remember correctly. For the Thai
                    families volunteering to host American AFSers we were even more careful in our
                    home descriptions. We had to imagine how well an American kid would be able to
                    deal with the specific conditions of that particular family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did most of those American kids end up in Bangkok, or did
                        they get out into the countryside?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Those who initially came in the full-year program were expected to
                    reach a level of basic classroom competence, with help from English-speaking
                    Thai teachers, so we placed them only in Bangkok during those first years.
                    However, later they were sent all over the country. Amazingly, even without
                    speaking more than rudimentary Thai, most of them did fine after a few months,
                    even in pretty rural areas. The summer program, which brought 14 kids while I
                    was there, was nationwide from the beginning. The American AFSers who came to
                    Thailand in those days, all of them about 17-years-old, were gutsy and
                    impressive kids. I was quite sure I never could have handled such an experience
                    at that age.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Has anyone ever gone back years later to see what's
                        happened to those kids, the Americans, I mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: I don't know of any systematic study of the Americanor the Thais
                    either. A lot of the Thai participants later became prominent in one area or
                    another of Thai society, and are great friends of the United States. The best
                    known probably is Surin Pitsuwan, who was Thailand's Foreign Minister until
                    recently. When I went back later as PAO, many Thais I ran into would say, “I was
                    one of those early kids you helped.” That made me feel terribly proud, even when
                    I couldn't exactly place them. It was a great program, one that worked mainly
                    because of the kids who took part, but also because it had tremendous support
                    from many quarterin the U.S. as well as in Thailand.</p>
                <p>Through AFS I met many Peace Corps Volunteers, quite a few of whom later became
                    great USIA officers. Among them were Harlan Rosacker, Robin Berrington, Frank
                    Albert, Ed Ifshin, Larry Daks and Gary Smith.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: The USIS Thailand field program was truly extraordinary. Our goal was
                    to serve as a kind of surrogate ministry of information to help the Thai
                    government achieve its security and development objectives in rural areas,
                    particularly in northeast Thailand. When in 1965 I went up to open our post in
                    Khon Kaen, a once-sleepy town that Thai Prime Minister Sarit Thanarat was
                    pouring money into with the aim of making it “the capital of the northeast,” we
                    had all the financial and equipment support I could have possibly asked for.
                    Besides plenty of regular stafperhaps six FSNI had other funds for hiring
                    “temporary” workers. We called them SPS (special personnel support) staffers.
                    Altogether I had maybe 15 people working for me, as many as you could stuff into
                    the little office area we rented along a downtown Khon Kaen street.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>We had probably six vehicles, a sedan for the BPAO and five CJ6s, which were
                    specially configured jeepcarefully designed by Biggerstafused for transporting
                    people, posters, pamphlets, and books, as well as equipment for showing films
                    out in the villages. In our base office we had a large collection of films and
                    perhaps 25 projectors we lent out to Thai institutions that wanted to show our
                    movies. All of us BPAOs had the latest AV equipment to use. For example, we had
                    new cameras to take pictures of anything we found in villages that might be
                    useable in a publication or poster. We had radios to do interviews that might be
                    used on one or more of the radio stations that we were supporting, or on VOA.
                    And we had 8-millimeter cameras for making “tactical films” that might be used
                    locally to show the Thai government working for the good of the people in the
                    villages. Of course, we had had no training in any of these areas, so the
                    results of our efforts were at best spotty. Still, it was a time of abundance,
                    innovation, and intense activity in support of a goal we all believed in.</p>
                <p>One premise of the field program planning by Biggerstafand also later by Jack
                    Zeller and Ben Fordnewas that throughout the country the 13 branch posts should
                    all have the same types of vehicles, projectors, cameras, etc. Bigg loved to
                    plan so much that he even designed a model house for Thailand Branch PAOand got
                    two of them built. My family lived in one of them in Khon Kaen, and my colleague
                    Mark Brawley and his wife down in Yala had the other one. The two houses had the
                    exact same floor plan. Unfortunately, they both suffered from the same planning
                    oversights. Bigg and his engineering partneJose Rico, I think his name
                    waneglected to allow for water to be piped into the inside kitchen area. The
                    assumption was that all the cooking and washing would be done by servants
                    working outside the main living area. And because Bigg liked spacious commodes,
                    we had an unusually large downstairs bathroom that featured a toilet placed in
                    the middle of a long waljust sort of sitting out there in splendid isolation. In
                    addition, the stairs between the first and second floors were designed to come
                    down into the middle of the dining and living room areas, but had no railings.
                    Bigg didn't have small kids, but we did. Banisters were quickly added, as was
                    piping to the inside kitchen. And I now realize that Bigg's overall concept of a
                    made-to-order USIS BPAO house, audacious as it was, wasn't at all bad. In those
                    days we were all amateurs, trying to do the best we could under urgent
                    conditions. And it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to give full rein to our
                    most creative imaginings. I didn't know any more about making movies than Bigg
                    knew about designing houses, but we all tried to give such tasks our best
                    shot.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>The centerpiece activity of the field program was the MIT trip, generally lasting
                    a week or two, that had us going out into villages in groups led by Thai
                    officials like a governor, deputy governor or district officeand also including
                    officials who could provide much needed services, like a doctor, veterinarian,
                    community development worker, or agricultural specialist. During my time in Khon
                    Kaen and Udorn, I estimate I stayed overnight in more than a hundred villages,
                    and spent at least that much time in district and provincial capitals. A couple
                    hundred nights in less than three years was a large cumulative chunk of time
                    away from home. It was hard on my wife and kids, and often strenuous and
                    otherwise difficult for me, too. I, however, was energized by all the
                    experiences I was havinand by the thought that I was being a brave and valued
                    soldier in the counter-insurgency battle.</p>
                <p>Conditions in some of the villages were plain awful. Most were very poor, and
                    some were wracked with diseaseincluding leprosand suffered from ineffective
                    leadership as well. Despite their exposure to anti-government Communist
                    propaganda, the villagers were almost invariably grateful for our visits,
                    particularly when they realized that we intended to be self sufficient in our
                    meals, including paying for anything we needed to supplement the supplies we
                    carried with us.</p>
                <p>For me personally the time in a village was a real challenge. I tried to come
                    across as a sympathetic foreign visitor, interested in admiring village folk
                    crafts like woven items and mousetraps, and not in any sense a leader of the
                    team. It gave me a great sense of satisfaction just to survive some of those
                    trips. Fortunately, I had great help from Thai FSN colleagues, especially Khun
                    Withee Suvarat in the Khon Kaen period and Khun Sanguan and Khun Tiew Tawat
                    Pantupong when I was in Udorn. The Thai USIS staffers provided the essential
                    mobile unit for the evening film showings and helped the Thai officials in
                    various ways. They were great guydedicated and brave. Three of our USIS Chiang
                    Mai colleagues were killed in a Communist ambush shortly after I left Thailand,
                    but we had no such incidents on the MITs in my time.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>I spoke Thai well enough to communicate with the officials and at a basic level
                    with villagers who spoke only Lao. I could overcome fears that our group might
                    come under attack by the Communists. I could sleep on bedbug-infested cushions
                    and under mosquito nets even when there were mosquitoes inside my neas I found
                    when I squashed their blood-besotted bodies early in the morning. I could find
                    my way to places to relieve myself when there were no toilets anywhere to be
                    found. I could eat food that was sometimes not properly cookehelped along by
                    Mekong whiskey or locally made rice whiskey that reduced my inhibitions about
                    eating such dishes as uncooked pork, raw lake shrimp, and ant eggeven, once,
                    live red ants. And I could maneuver the Thai cloth called a pakoma skillfully
                    enough to take a standing bath using water from a large water jar, maintaining
                    my modesty when washing and drying even though fully surrounded by Thai kids
                    eagerly anticipating a misstep on my part. That I could do all of this game me a
                    sense of confidence and accomplishment. And actually, it was often fun. I
                    traveled with and met some wonderful people, the villagers were exceedingly
                    generous, and not infrequently the food was tasty. Sometimes we had gourmet
                    fare, like frogs legs, roast pig, or cannabis-laced soups or chicken curry.</p>
                <p> reports on these trips were sent back to Bangkok. The Ambassador (first Graham
                    Martin and then Leonard Unger) would say, “You guys are my eyes and ears out
                    there.” How many of our reports got such ambassadorial attention I don't know,
                    but we believed our reports got read by people who could make good use of them,
                    so we were careful to describe the specific characteristics of a particular
                    village, the amount of cohesion it seemed to have, its problems, and the major
                    issue the villagers brought to the team leader (potable water being the most
                    frequently cited felt need). The intelligence people, civilian and military,
                    loved our reports. We often heard from Embassy colleagues that we were doing
                    important, even enviable, work on the front lines of U.S. policy in
                    Thailand.</p>
                <p>BPAO UDOR1967-68</p>
                <p>When I went to Udorn I had, in addition to all the MIT activity, the additional
                    responsibility of working on troop-community relations. My predecessors as BPAO
                    Udorn were Ed Schulick and, before him, Gordon Murchie, both of whom had done
                    really amazing work in gaining the friendship and confidence of local officials
                    in Udorn and nearby jurisdictions. I had the good fortune of being able to pick
                    up on their excellent contacts among the Thais. However, dealing with the senior
                    U.S. military was not so easy for ma 29-year-old snot-nosed civilian whose only
                    authority came from being a junior member of the Udorn Consulate. In 1967-68
                    Udorn was a major Thai base from which we prosecuted the air war over Vietnam.
                    In addition, it was the headquarters both for Air America and other elements of
                    the CIA's so-called “secret war in Laos” and also for the Thai government's
                    counter-insurgency effort in the northeast provinces bordering the Mekong
                    River.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>I worked closely with our exceptionally able Consul, Al Francis, on various
                    efforts to promote reasonably comfortable relations between the U.S. Air Force
                    and community leaders in Udorn. Though the senior officers listened politely to
                    my suggestions for minimizing frictions with the local populace, their reaction
                    often was, “Yeah, we know cultural sensitivity is important, but don't bother us
                    too much about it. Our mission is to fight a war, after all.” One of my ideas
                    was to take some of the “civic action” officers on an MIT to visit villages on
                    the periphery of the base itself. They were pretty shocked to see how easy it
                    was for villagers to walk directly onto the base. With no proper perimeter
                    fence, the base was extremely vulnerable, but no one took action to protect it.
                    Shortly after our MIT, Communists sappers went in and fire-bombed some of our
                    planes, and then made a clean getaway. In a few instances, problems we uncovered
                    on that MIT could be and were addressed. For example, equipment was brought out
                    to build a needed well, and in another case steps were taken to reduce the noise
                    level of on-base testing of jet engines that greatly disturbed services at a
                    Thai temple.</p>
                <p>On Saturdays I regularly took part in briefings of incoming Airmen. I gave them
                    general advice on showing respect for the Thai King and Queen, avoiding
                    offending sensibilities by publicly fondling their Thai girl friends, and
                    behaving appropriately at Thai ceremonies. As I was about to leave the country,
                    I wrote down a summary of my main points, and passed the draft to a senior Air
                    Force officer. Years later I learned, much to my surprise, that my text was used
                    almost word-for-word in a pamphlet called “Thai Customs and Courtesies” that was
                    given to all U.S. Air Force personnel assigned to Thailand from 1969 until we
                    pulled out in 1975.</p>
                <p>I sometimes used my residence as a venue for large dinner parties that brought
                    the Air Force officers together with local officials and their spouses. As an
                    “ice breaker” I would serve a concoction made from mixing village rice whiskey
                    with small amounts of the blood of a kind of monkey found in the remote parts of
                    Laos and northeast Thailand. The blood supposedly had various medicinal
                    qualities, and was also considered an aphrodisiac. It would be slightly
                    congealed in the bottom of the bottle, so vigorous shaking was part of the
                    ritual. The Thai officials, especially the macho police and military officials,
                    recognized the concoction as a rare and special libation, while my American
                    military guests, though generally queasy if not horrified, gamely took a shot or
                    two as the price of building close relations with their Thai counterparts. It
                    was a kinky idea, and perhaps had desirable cross-cultural bonding results, but
                    the practice was not universally lauded. Later on, I heard that in some quarters
                    I was known as a monkey killer who sent his staff into the mountains to procure
                    blood to feed my filthy habit. When I returned to Thailand in the 1980s I was
                    told that those monkeys had become virtually extinct, and didn't feel at all
                    proud that I had contributed to their demise.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>When I left Udorn in 1968 the USIS Thailand field program was at its largest. We
                    had 50 officers overall, most of them working in the branches, 13 branch posts,
                    and perhaps 500 Thai staffers. I had an Assistant BPAO, first John Fredenburg
                    and then Frank Albert. Both were great guys to work with, and later went on to
                    head their own posts. John, who started the branch post in Nongkhai, on the
                    Mekong River just across from Vientiane, and reported to me from there, was the
                    first and last BPAO in Nongkhai. With such responsibilities on my young
                    shoulders, I was blessed by working for excellent officers. Ben Fordney had a
                    terrific avuncular touch as leader of the entire field program at that stage of
                    its history, and Ed Schulick was my immediate boss, having taken that position
                    just after turning USIS Udorn over to me. Ed was probably the best boss I had
                    during my entire career. A born leader, he was enormously dedicated, thoughtful,
                    and empathetic. He always seemed able to draw out your deepest concerns as well
                    as your best thinking, and could then help you find needed focus for tackling
                    the task ahead. Ed later used his talents in fashioning the Agency's speaker
                    program, but tragically died of cancer not long after his Thailand tour.</p>
                <p>PHASE II IN WASHINGTON</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1968, you went back to Washington as a part of the
                        Phase II training program. Refresh my memory as to what Phase II was all
                        about.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: An officer by the name of Jim Halsema came up with the idea that
                    officers like me, who were relatively new to USIA and to the media dimensions of
                    public affairs should have a second, Washington-based stage of career traininto
                    expose them to the media products and other support operations run out of USIA
                    headquarters. In those days most of us joining the Agency had had little if any
                    previous experience with the media, unlike those who came in after the war. The
                    idea was that, over a three-year Washington tour, we would spend one year on
                    short assignments to various parts of the Agency, one year in a mainstream job,
                    and the third year in language training or other preparation for our next
                    assignment.</p>
                <p>It was definitely a concept that sought to address a real need, and those charged
                    with implementing it, like John Challinor, tried to be flexible and helpful to
                    us. But of course we the trainees soon came face to face with the serious flaws
                    in the idea. The receiving offices, especially in the media, were not crazy
                    about having an ongoing parade of trainees coming in and out of their purview.
                    Often we were given mundane tasks and never got a real sense of what was going
                    on. That happened to me when I was assigned to line up donations for a major
                    USIA-sponsored education exhibit headed for Eastern Europe. No one in the
                    section ever took the time to brief me on the purposes of the exhibit, much less
                    the concept of how it was being structured. In all too many cases, the
                    rotational assignments had little relation to our interests or immediate
                    needs.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>Besides that, we were sick of being trainees and being treated as ignorant
                    neophytes. And it was 1968, after all, prime time in an era of striking back at
                    authority. By 1969 there were some 50 officers in the program. With me as one of
                    the “ring-leaders,” we got nearly all 50 to sign a strong petition complaining
                    about the program. We asked that it be substantially modified to more closely
                    meet our individual needs. Our protest led to significant changes, for example
                    by being a major factor behind the Agency's establishment of a new system of
                    career counselors responsible for helping guide younger officers and looking out
                    for their best interests in the assignment process.</p>
                <p>In truth, my own Phase II experience had many enlightening and positive elements.
                    On my way back from Udorn, even before checking into Washington, I was asked to
                    be the escort interpreter for a Thai governor traveling on an International
                    Visitors Program. That grantee, Governor Phat of Ubol, was a key figure in
                    ensuring a secure and friendly welcome to the U.S. Air Force units based in his
                    province. The USIS Thailand leadership insisted that my recent experience in
                    neighboring Udorn would be particularly helpful to the success of his visit.
                    This assignment gave me a rare chance to see the operations of the marvelous IV
                    program up close. Our itinerary emphasized certain military communities which
                    were eager to roll out the red carpet for this key official from Thailand, our
                    Vietnam War allsuch as Ft. Bragg, Eglin Air Force Base, and the Air Force
                    Academy. During our travels around the country we met some truly amazing
                    Americans within the IV volunteer network who generously provided services
                    ranging from home hospitality to simply driving us from one point to another.
                    That was a great education for me.</p>
                <p>On the negative side, I found working with the prickly grantee a bit of a trial.
                    One incident stands out in my mind. We went to Houston, where the local Council
                    for International Visitors had arranged for him to be given a prominent seat at
                    a pro-Nixon rally, a significant local event in that 1968 presidential campaign
                    summer. Our plane had been a bit behind schedule, and he, understandably tired
                    and out of sorts, suddenly said, “I don't think I'll go to that rally.” Ouch! I
                    tried to persuade him to change his mind, but he said he just wanted to go have
                    some noodles and turn in early. When I called the local sponsors, they were very
                    upsewith him and with me. They irately asked me: “Do you have any idea how hard
                    it was to arrange this? Do you understand that the next time we try to set up
                    such special attention for a visitor, we are much less likely to get it?” I gave
                    it another try, telling him about all the trouble the local people had gone to,
                    the VIP treatment that had been laid on, and the importance to him personally as
                    well as to Thailand of this golden opportunity to meet the man most likely to
                    become the next president of the United States. All to no avaiand we had to
                    cancel his attendance at the event. Later on the Governor told me that the real
                    reason he had been so reluctant to go was that he feared his presence might
                    become a factor in our election!</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>That is only one of my many Governor Phat stories. Suffice to say here that the
                    IV assignment was an interesting experience, a challenge to my diplomatic and
                    Thai language skills, and at the same time an extraordinary opportunity to get
                    reacquainted with my own country. The latter was particularly important. I was
                    probably having almost as much culture shock as Governor Phat was. After all, I
                    left the country when John Kennedy was president and came back following the
                    assassinations of Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King. The Democratic national
                    convention took place in Chicago while we were on the trip. I would stay up at
                    night watching the horrific events surrounding that convention. Then I would
                    meet Governor Phat for breakfast, and he would say something like: “By the way,
                    I was watching television last night, but with my poor English I couldn't
                    understand what was happening. Why were all those people shouting? And what were
                    those police dogs doing attacking people?” As best I could, overcoming my own
                    confusion and shock, I tried to make the appropriate, reassuring “in context”
                    remarks about the vibrancy of our political system, our long tradition of
                    anti-government demonstrations, and the ongoing internal U.S. debate about the
                    Vietnam War.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During your initial Phase II training, what specifically
                        did you do so far as exposure to Agency media and other operations was
                        concerned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: At VOA I worked in the newsroom for a couple of weeks, and then filled
                    in for about a month for Jack Zeller as acting head of the VOA Thai Service.
                    After that, I wrote two or three articles for one of the Agency's general
                    interest magazines about America. And I worked on the American education exhibit
                    I mentioned earlier. I was able to practice such skills as news and publication
                    writing, radio program management, and telephone solicitation (for the exhibit),
                    but as no one gave me direct feedback on my work in any of the offices, I didn't
                    really have an experience that could be called “training.” On the other hand, I
                    gained enormous respect for the skills of the GS professionals in USIA's various
                    media offices.</p>
                <p>Also during the period I went out on a week-long recruiting stint for USIA. To
                    make the most of the “orientation to America” dimension of that assignment, I
                    volunteered to visit campuses on our list that had had strong antiwar
                    demonstrations, including San Francisco State. I got there on Vietnam Moratorium
                    Day, 196not exactly a promising moment to be recruiting for the Federal
                    Governmenbut spoke to several classes and got into lively discussions with some
                    of the more activist students. Much to my surprise, I actually a recruited a
                    future USIA officer, George Bonjoc, while I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So Phase II was worthwhile from your standpoint, is that
                        right?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>BLACKBURN: I didn't have such a bad experience, but the concept had fundamental
                    flaws that I tried to point out. First of all, they never should have tried to
                    make us all follow essentially the same schedule. Quite a few of the junior
                    officers came from the media to start with, and certainly didn't need the kind
                    of rotation we were put through. Another flaw was that going from place to place
                    to place was too much like the JOT training we were so glad to have behind us.
                    Besides that, the receiving offices quickly lost any enthusiasm they might have
                    initially had, because we were pretty inexperienced and weren't around long
                    enough to make a substantial contribution to their operations.</p>
                <p>In our protest, I was a leader of our six-person “review committee.” We met over
                    lunch every week and talked about what actually might improve the program. We
                    tried to consult with everybody and sent questionnaires around to make sure we
                    were not leaving out anybody's ideas. The effort was somewhat “underground,” but
                    not really secretivand we shared all our findings and suggestions with Agency
                    managers. We had some rather large meetings with those running the program.
                    There was some defensiveness by those who had developed it, but the exchanges
                    were not particularly contentious, and the managers really had no choice but to
                    recognize that we were making solid, well-researched criticisms.</p>
                <p>We basically said we opposed and resented the cookie cutter approach. Instead, we
                    wanted a personnel system that could interact with each of us coming back for
                    our first assignment in Washingtoand develop individualized programs, based on
                    each person's special needs and desires, for preparing us to become more
                    effective officers over the long run. Basically, they bought it. Rob Nevitt was
                    head of Foreign Service personnel about that time, and he was responsible, I
                    believe, for starting the career development officer system. He and others in
                    personnel were very sympathetic to us. So we got the career counselors we had
                    asked for, and the training became less elaborate. The whole program faded out
                    within a few years, but it had been a valiant attempt to deal with the real
                    problem of our general ignorance about the functioning of USIA's media.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The weakness had been that personnel did not have any
                        leverage in the media sections, in terms of making sure that the Phase II
                        trainees were properly taken care of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Yes, there was that. In addition to our own resentments about being
                    supernumeraries, the media people were undermining it or criticizing the whole
                    program from a different direction.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>This was all happening about the time that Frank Shakespeare became the USIA
                    Director in 1969 and started what he called the Young Officer Policy Panel, or
                    YOPP. Shakespeare laudably sought to find out what the younger people of USIA
                    were thinking. YOPP had about 16 members, half of them Foreign Service and half
                    Civil Service. It was headed first by Mike Schneider and then by Mike Canning. I
                    was not on it originally, but filled the first FS vacancy. We would meet
                    regularly to discuss issues, and sometimes met with Shakespeare himself.</p>
                <p>We in YOPP took particular interest in how the Agency was treating the Vietnam
                    War and the range of U.S. opinion related to it. We looked, for example, at
                    VOA's coverage of the war, to try to determine how biased or balanced it was.
                    That was when I learned never to ask VOA a question that suggested they might
                    not have been covering any particular subject. Even for obscure subjects, VOA
                    has doubtless devoted many hours to it, and they can readily dump reams and
                    reams of broadcast scripts on you. Whether VOA's coverage of Vietnam issues was
                    or was not adequately balanced or credible was far beyond our ability to assess.
                    But the spirit of that time was that we USIA's professionals were not only
                    engaged in important work, we could also influence decisions about what our
                    Agency's future direction should be. What would be the role of film, whether
                    Agency-produced or acquired? What about publications? What should be the future
                    of the binational centers? It was an exciting period. Much like I had
                    experienced in the USIS Thailand program, it seemed that all issues were on the
                    table, innovative thinking was encouraged, and everything was possible. Not only
                    the junior or mid-level officers, but many senior officers were also questioning
                    assumptions and trying to suggest new directions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: People like Alan Carter, Dan Oleksiw, and Jodie Lewinsohn, three very
                    strong and controversial personalities who became mentors and strong supporters
                    of mine at various times over the ensuing years. They were critiquing our
                    involvement in “counter insurgency” and “nation building” especially in
                    Southeast Asiand proposing a wide range of operational and administrative
                    changes. Others were focused on how better to build more international support
                    for our Vietnam involvement.</p>
                <p>I was fortunate to be involved directly or tangentially in much of this
                    discussion, through the YOPP and otherwise, as I got to know and collaborate
                    with interesting people from all parts of the Agency, in both the Civil Service
                    and the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Shakespeare's role in this personally? Did he get
                        a lot of feedback?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Yes, he got some feedback. He would meet with us from time to time. I
                    remember one time he met with us and he was quite upset about the “incursion”
                    into Cambodia, which turned out to be one of the pivotal events of our Vietnam
                    involvement. He said it was really hard for us persuasively to justify, and very
                    damaging to our image abroad, but we as the United States Information Agency of
                    the U.S. Government had to do the best we could with the policies we had. We of
                    course agreed with him - so we kind of agonized together. I don't know really,
                    in operational terms, exactly what came of that discussion, but it was certainly
                    good for our morale to be interacting so candidly with our Director.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Henry Loomis was his Deputy at that point, is that
                        correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: That was the period when Loomis was his Deputy and Jack O'Brien was
                    the Special Assistant to Loomis. Actually, it is quite possible that the YOPP
                    was originally Loomis' idea, but Shakespeare certainly embraced it and Loomis
                    never showed up at any of our meetings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe I didn'and still don'have the right vantage point,
                        but I don't remember being aware of any positive developments within the
                        Agency of the sort you are talking about. There was a lot of ferment,
                        perhaps, but did anybody take hold of it and say this is the lesson of all
                        this and we should make these changes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: As far as messages or big operational changes, I can't think of new
                    themes or products that can be credited directly to the YOPP or junior officers
                    more generally. I think you could say that during the period we were all going
                    through a lot of personal questioning that went beyond just advancing our
                    careers. We were asking if we were right to be working for our government, and,
                    if we were going to stay with the Agency, what could be done to make it more of
                    an institution we would be proud to work for. A lot of people were quitting the
                    Agency, and retention and morale were very much on everybody's minds at that
                    time. Career development, fairness to all employees, recruitment of minorities,
                    and the like were topics we talked about, but the Vietnam War and the general
                    unrest of the late 1960s dominated much of our thinking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think you're right about that. This was the period in
                        which you had a sense that personnel was beginning to take a more direct
                        interest in the individual officer. Care was being taken about where these
                        guys were assigned. They had to compete more or less fairly with their peers
                        to get assignments. Previously, it had been, geographically via the area
                        offices, that there were cliques and clubs where people got assignments
                        because they had done well in a particular post and were favored by those
                        managers, so they were transferred to another area post or brought back to
                        the area offices. Some of that led to abuses, I think, how much I don't
                        know. Now, where do we go from here?</hi>

                <p>SPECIAL ASSISTANT IN ASIA AREA OFFIC1969-70</p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: To my working as Dan Oleksiw's Special Assistant in the “Far East”
                    Area Office, or IAF. Your mention of the Area Directors' control over personnel
                    assignments in that era is very pertinent. I was the beneficiary of just this
                    systea system I should say that operated in almost identical fashion during my
                    last assignment in the East Asia Bureau of the State Department. Dan, as IAF
                    Director, said he was going to have an open competition among all the young
                    officers who had an interest in Asia to pick his special assistant. About 15 or
                    20 of us were summoned to his office for a brown bag lunch to talk with him and
                    “strut our stuff” in hopes of getting this plum assignment. As it happened, my
                    friend John Burns, who had been in the Thai field program with me, was the
                    personnel officer for IAF. He told me Dan had picked me long before that
                    session, and that the paperwork had already gone through the system.</p>
                <p>I am not sure things were quite that finalized, but in any case I got chosen, and
                    had a fantastic opportunity to witness the internal operations of the area most
                    concerned with the Vietnam War and many other important developments of that
                    period. Dan was extraordinarily generous to me. Saying he wanted me to know
                    everything he was doing, he put my desk right outside his door, between him and
                    his secretary, Mary Lipper, so that I could see every piece of paper that came
                    in, on any subject. I also sat in on all of his meetings, if I was available, on
                    any subject. It was really quite something to have that kind of access to the
                    leader of what was a very active and high-powered office. Fitzhugh (Fitz) Green
                    was the deputy, and Dave Hitchcock, Jodie Lewinsohn, and Ike Izenberg were all
                    policy officers at one time or another. Stanton Jue and Jim Hoyt, and many
                    others were also on that team. It was an intense period for me personally. Dan
                    wanted me in his presence so much that he actually picked me in the mornings at
                    a place close to my house and dropped me off at night after work, usually after
                    7 p.m. He had a very old green Buick that would be loaded up with his pals and
                    go lumbering down Wisconsin Avenue on its way to 1776 Pennsylvania Avenue, where
                    he had somehow wangled a parking slot just outside the back door.</p>
                <p>Because that was Vietnam War time, and due to his own proclivities, Dan was very
                    much involved in personnel issues. I would sit in on his long sessions with
                    personnel officers or others that would invariably start late in the day after
                    the close of regular business. Asia personnel chief Bernie Lavin, or later Evan
                    Fotos, would come up to Dan's office to cover personnel matters with great
                    candor. Discussion often focused on people who were reluctant to accept jobs in
                    Vietnam. Such assignments tended to be hard on marriages and not good for
                    careers either. I sat through several excruciating sessions where officers
                    pitifully pleaded to be allowed to break their assignments. Though Dan usually
                    did not support such requests, I don't think he was the cold-blooded person that
                    some people considered hiand in fact found him sometimes extremely soft-hearted.
                    Over all, though, he definitely had the toughness the Agency needed for such a
                    job at that time.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>Another priority for the area office was sending out moon rocks, of all things.
                    The first moon-landings had just taken place, and people all over the world
                    wanted to see what the astronauts had found up there. We got a share of the
                    haul, and Ray McGunigle and others put a lot of time into figuring out where in
                    East Asia they would go, who would personally escort them the conditions of
                    display, and the like. The moon rocks gave us a welcome positive story to tell
                    our overseas audiences when we were getting so much criticism over the Vietnam
                    War.</p>
                <p>During that time, I got drawn into the middle of a dispute Dan Oleksiw was having
                    with Lew Schmidt, the PAO in Bangkok at the time. When Lew went out to Bangkok
                    in 1967 to replace Jack O'Brian, Dan had in structed him to cut back the USIS
                    Thailand field program, saying that it was not an appropriate use of the
                    taxpayer's money to have USIS operating essentially as a surrogate information
                    ministry for the Thai Government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are saying that Oleksiw sent Schmidt out there with
                        precisely those marching orders?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Those were Lew's instructions when he went out there, yes. But when
                    Lew arrived and heard from all of uand from others up and down the line in the
                    Embasswhat we were doing and how important we all thought it was, he told Dan he
                    had reached the conclusion that the USIS Thailand field program he had inherited
                    was on the right track and we should not precipitously turn everything over to
                    the Thais.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Lew have the backing of the Embassy and the Ambassador
                        on that? The Ambassador at that time would have been Leonard Unger,
                        right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Yes, Lew had their backing, but Dan, with the support of the Agency
                    leadership, insisted that they should get out of the field program as fast as
                    possible. Dan in early 1968 went to Thailand to see for himself what was going
                    oand that was when I first met him. He accompanied Lew on a trip to the south,
                    during the course of which they dropped in on an AID-supported training program
                    for midwives, for which USIS was providing some publicity. When Dan returned to
                    Washington he infuriated Lew by dismissively characterizing the USIS Thailand
                    program as one devoted to “midwifery.” The dispute cut so deeply, for both of
                    them, that they both treat the incident in considerable detail in their oral
                    histories.</p>
                <p>So there I was in the IAF area office, on the one hand working for Dan Oleksiw
                    and on the other hand a proud alum of what I had fully believed was a valuable
                    and effective USIS Thailand field program. At the same time, many of the senior
                    USIS Thailand officers were now back in Washington. A number of them, like Jack
                    O'Brien and Rob Nevitt, had a broader perspective on the USIS Thailand program
                    than I did, but Dan decided that I should be the person to make an objective
                    presentation to Frank Shakespeare and Henry Loomis on what we were really doing
                    there.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>I pulled together a great deal of materiaboth in written and film
                    formatdemonstrating that although much of what we did could be considered
                    information work for the Thai government, we were also devoting substantial
                    attention to spreading information about the U.S. for example, through the
                    regular TV program “Report from America,” our translated books, our exchange
                    programs, and targeted materials dealing with the space program, our foreign and
                    domestic policies, and U.S. direct support for Thailand's development. The
                    presentation for Shakespeare and Loomis was heavily attended and gave, I felt,
                    an honest, balanced, and essentially positive picture of a carefully planned and
                    implemented USIA field program in support of a key ally in the Vietnam War.
                    Whatever they thought of the briefing, the Agency's leadership continued to
                    support Dan's push to eliminate those activities that did not directly deal with
                    the U.S. The pressure intensified when Lew's assignment ended in 2000 and Keith
                    Adamson, and then Jack Hedges, took over. By 1972 the post was transferring
                    operations and equipment to elements of the Thai government at a very rapid
                    clip.</p>
                <p>During those Phase II years, I was also completing a doctorate at American
                    University's School of International Service. At that time the Agency was
                    extremely generous to officers who wanted to take courses having to do with
                    public affairs, communications, or regional studies. I cashed in on that
                    largesse, taking five or six fully-subsidized courses at SIS. Having gotten a
                    master's degree at SAIS and later done additional course work at American
                    University, I calculated that if everything broke for mand with a lot of work at
                    night and on the weekendI would be able to complete the Ph.D. during my three
                    years back in Washington between overseas assignments. For my dissertation topic
                    I chose to look at mass media and national development in Southeast Asia,
                    specifically Burma, Malaysia, and Thailand. As this topic was of interest to the
                    Agency, I got some help in that respect as well. For example, when it came time
                    to collect data, I was able to extend an inspection TDY to Italy so that I could
                    spend a week each in the three countries I was studyinand get help from the
                    local staffs, especially in Burma, with finding materials and identifying people
                    to interview. Then when I got back to Washington and was finishing up some of
                    the analysis, I got myself parked in the research office with Gordon Tubbs for
                    about a month. Even Frank Shakespeare took an interest in what I was doing, and
                    invited me to his office to talk about it. So, thanks to all that help and moral
                    supporand busting my butI got the Ph.D. just before leaving town for my
                    assignment to Japan. Of course, having a doctorate while working in USIA was
                    pretty close to useless, though I did sometimes find it useful to stick a
                    “doctor” in front of my name, especially when performing such roles as chairing
                    a Fulbright Commission. And besides the satisfaction of meeting the academic and
                    intellectual challenges afforded by working on the degree, it also served as a
                    kind of insurance policy to keep in my back pocket should the Agency sour on me,
                    or I sour on it.</p>
                <p>JAPANESE LANGUAGE TRAINING IN WASHINGTON AND YOKOHAM1970-72</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you also preparing to go to Japan at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Yes, I was. Fortunately, I had finished the first draft of the
                    dissertation before I started Japanese training at FSI, so did not have that
                    hanging over my head.</p>
                <p>Having been interested in Japan for a long time and with some earlier self study
                    under my belt, I was able to get a fast jump on the Japanese language training.
                    I really didn't want to put aside two full years for language study, but hoped
                    to earn the required 3/3 in one year and start working right away. The FSI
                    teachers (especially Tanaka-sensei, a gifted educator known to many of her
                    students as “Tiger Tanaka” for her boot camp type drilling of beginning
                    students) really encouraged and pushed me. I got the S-3/R-3 after that one
                    year, the first student ever to have done so, I was told. Still, there was no
                    appropriate job for me in Japan, and my Japanese was not all that deeply
                    implanted anyway.</p>
                <p>When I got to FSI Yokohama in the summer of 1971, the teachers were very kind,
                    but essentially said, “Burakuban-san, you may have gotten a 3/3 back in
                    Washington, but you don't yet have a 3/3 by our reckoning.” The terrific team of
                    Japanese teachers in Yokohama worked me over pretty well that year, while
                    keeping my spirits up through ping-pong games, go lessons, and occasional
                    drinking bouts. In the end I scored a 3+/3+, which was pretty good, but not the
                    4/4 to which I had earlier aspired and which some had predicted I might be able
                    to attain.</p>
                <p>One of the highlights of the Japanese language program was my participation in
                    the annual Japanese speech contest for foreigners that is broadcast live on NHK.
                    With enormous help from an extraordinary Japanese instructor, Konno-sensei, I
                    wrote a speech on the stages of my supposed “love affair” with the Sony
                    Trinitron TV set that aided my language learning efforts. Looking back on the
                    experience today, I wonder why I came up with such a sappy subject. Still, it
                    was a good speech, reasonably well delivered despite my on-air stage fright, the
                    Japanese loved it, and I beat out most of the competition to win third prizthe
                    best anyone from FSI Yokohama had ever performed in that contest, and a record
                    that may still stand.</p>
                <p>After two years of the exquisite agony that only Japanese language students
                    knoand I can attest that spoken Chinese is a breeze in comparisoI was eager and
                    ready for my assignment at the heart of Alan Carter's would-be USIS utopia, the
                    Tokyo American Center.</p>
                <p>TOKYO AMERICAN CENTER DIRECTO1972-75</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you know you would be going to the Tokyo center,
                        and who did you replace?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: I knew about it roughly a year in advance. I replaced Warren Obluck, a
                    superb officer who had made tremendous contacts within the Tokyo arts
                    community.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>Actually, Frank Shakespeare took an interest in my assignment to Tokyo, and told
                    me he had personally and enthusiastically signed off on it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So while you were studying Japanese, Carter showed up as
                        PAO, right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Alan arrived there in 1970, replacing Ned Roberts, just as I was
                    getting started in the language training. On his arrival he announced a
                    determination to fundamentally revamp a program he viewed as almost totally
                    inappropriate for advancing our interests in the Japan of that time. He said the
                    operation had become flaccid. The bulk of the post's key contacts dated back to
                    the Occupation period, we were spending much of our time, energy, and money on
                    “cultural centers” that had outlived their democracy-tutelage original purposes,
                    and a scathingly-critical younger generation of Japanese viewed the U.S. as a
                    nation in decline. Alan, I think correctly, concluded that USIS Japan, in both
                    style and content, should reflect a vibrant, up-to-date America poised to
                    exercise leadership in the decades ahead.</p>
                <p>Although capable Japan specialist Dave Hitchcock served as Alan's deputy, most of
                    the post's Japan experts and Japanophiles were moved to the sidelines or out the
                    door. In their place came an extraordinarily talented and brilliant group of
                    officers. Among thebesides Dave Hitchcocwere Barry Fulton, Don Hausrath, Ray
                    Komai, and Dennis Askey. Harlan Rosacker, another outstanding officer and later
                    the head of USIA personnel, ably handled press relations, but was not centrally
                    involved in the “Carter revolution.”</p>
                <p>First among the revolutionaries was Barry Fulton. Barry had Alan's complete
                    confidence and was in overall charge of planning and implementing the new
                    organizational concept. His first act was to “seize the mailroom” to get a feel
                    for what sorts of communications were passing between offices and in what
                    formats. Soon we all had standardized letterheads for USIS products, with
                    stationary and name cards that were all part of a modernistic design concept
                    masterminded by Ray Komai.</p>
                <p>Among Barry's early tasks was to set up an integrated speaker system along the
                    lines of the “packaged programming” concept first articulated, I believe, by Sam
                    Courtneand put into practice when Alan was Area Director for the Near East and
                    South Asia just before being assigned to Japan. It was a great and, at the time,
                    highly innovative idea. When a speaker came to us at the Tokyo American Center
                    (TAC), it was not just a one-off event, but part of a broad-gauged effort that
                    often included materials for distribution, other Japanese and American speakers,
                    simultaneous translation, and lively A/V elements such as “triptych” slide
                    introductions.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>At the time we had branches in Nagoya, Kyoto, Osaka, Fukuoka and Sapporo. All
                    USIS activities operated out of American Centers (ACs) in those cities. The TAC
                    was part of a tightly integrated AC network, and my official Agency title was
                    “Branch PAO Tokyo.” To emphasize our intention to address tough policy issues,
                    the former “American Cultural Centers” had been shut down for refurbishment and
                    then reopened as “American Centers.” All of the ACs used essentially the same
                    speakers, had the same library collections, and featured the same modular
                    furniture, for example. And we all operated according to detailed instructions,
                    written or approved by Barry, that we kept in loose leaf folders by our
                    desks.</p>
                <p>Barry invented the first full-fledged “Audience Record System (ARS),” which later
                    became the Agency's standardized Distribution and Record System, or DRS. We
                    worked hard to identify the key organizations and audience members we would try
                    to reach with our activities, limited our invitation lists essentially to people
                    we had identified, and kept track of how well we did in contacting them over
                    time. In addition, each officer at the post was charged with maintaining his or
                    her own “inner circle” of about 20 individuals who were supposed to receive our
                    personal attention on a regular basis. We would report attendance at programs
                    and other interactions to a central ARS office of the post. Every few months we
                    would get a computer printout that showed how we and the other ACs were doing in
                    terms of reaching our audiences with various types of program activities.
                    Although Barry had thought through many of the fundamental issues, implementing
                    his concepts brought out the Jesuit in each of uas we struggled to define
                    precisely who should be in or out of the system, how much of our effort should
                    be devoted to bringing people to our centeras opposed to taking speakers to
                    other venuewhat to do about keeping track of students in the ARS, and so on. And
                    on and on.</p>
                <p>Don Hausrath was in charge of the libraries. They were no longer called
                    “libraries,” but became “Infomats” to emphasize their new status as outlets for
                    current “information materials.” The Infomats were technologically well ahead of
                    most Japanese institutions of that era. We had video as well as audio cassette
                    collections, including excellent materials on U.S. scientific achievements as
                    well as VCRs of the best of our AC speaker programs. And, beginning in 1972, we
                    used an early form of a FAX machine, with which we could communicate with the
                    USIS Infomat support office and between ACs. It took about ten minutes per page
                    for the transmission, but it was very handy for answering reference questions
                    and doing other business.</p>
                <p>Besides the modular furniture, another important design feature was our beanbag
                    chairs on the floor all around the Infomat. The Japanese loved to sit in them
                    and read. And of course sometimes they would be so comfortable they would fall
                    asleep. When Alan would come to the TAC and find a patron dozing, it seemed to
                    make him mad, because he would go over and give the “chair” a little kick. If
                    you have ever tried to sleep in a beanbag chair and had someone kick it, you
                    know it wakes you right up. By the time the startled Japanese patron had his
                    wits about him, Alan would be well away from the area, with an innocent but
                    satisfied look on his face.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>The most innovative, radical and controversial aspect of the Infomat was its
                    approach to the collection itself. For starters, each of the six ACs had exactly
                    the same 3,000 titles, 2,000 of them for circulation and 1,000 to meet the
                    reference needs of our audiences. The TAC had an additional 1,000 reference
                    titles, for a total in all of 4,000 volumes. The standard 2,000 circulating
                    titles were divided equally among the five major themeor post objectivethat also
                    guided our speaker programming. These themes were: security and U.S.-Japan
                    relations, economics, American society, arts, and what we called “”toward the
                    year 2000” the latter reflecting our desire to address the great Japanese
                    interest in futurology. With 400 titles devoted to each theme, it was further
                    decreed that no more than 100 of them could be more than five years old, and the
                    other 300 should be roughly divided among works published in the previous five
                    years. The concept was that we would collectively work togethewith help from the
                    Japanese staff who scanned Japanese newspapers and magazines as well as library
                    support personnel back in Washingtoto identify and procure the 60 most important
                    and pertinent books published annually in each of the five subject areas.
                    Further, to maintain the rigidly disciplined nature of the collection, we weeded
                    out the same number of books we added to our shelves each year. A lot of people
                    found this approach reprehensible, or at least astoundinespecially the idea that
                    after we had already disposed of tens of thousands of volumes from the old
                    Cultural Centers we were now prepared to discard even perfectly serviceable
                    newer ones to meet some kind of mechanistic formula. It was definitely a rigid
                    approach, but I didn't oppose it. I generally agreed with the thesis that such
                    discipline was a necessary underpinning for our great exertions to obtain the
                    most up-to-date materialeven to the extent of having books airshipped to us for
                    use in programs or to feature on our shelves. And our key audiences appreciated
                    what we were trying to do, and began to look to us as a major source for any
                    research they were doing that related to the United States.</p>
                <p>Ray Komai was the design specialist, who worked closely with Dennis Askey on the
                    art work for the post's upscale Japanese-language magazine. Trends was a
                    beautiful monthly product that not only featured modern American art and
                    architecture, but also carried in-depth articles on our other major themes.</p>
                <p>In designing the centers, Ray worked with the incomparable Lynn Nyce of the
                    central USIA space design office to came up with a contemporary look. The look
                    featured supergraphics that showed visitors the way to rest rooms, “REFERENCE,”
                    or whatever, tubular legs on tables and desks, white walls, large modern prints,
                    and a strict policy of no personal itemincluding photos, calendars and floweron
                    desks. The latter dictum was the hardest for many to swallow. All the public and
                    working spaces of the ACs were intended to give a modern, professional feel.
                    Those of us who worked there were viewed essentially as temporary occupants of
                    the space.</p>

                <p>BLACKBURN: When I took over the Tokyo American Center, which was at Akasaka
                    Mitsuke about a mile from our embassy, it had just been renovated and launched
                    in the new format. We were the experimental ground zero for the new approach.
                    People came to check us out all the time. The Japanese were fascinated by the
                    experiment, stopping by in droves to sample our services or just see what we
                    were up to. In Tokyo, as in other cities with American Centers, the revamped
                    operations received extensive and positive newspaper, magazine, and TV coverage.
                    Alan, justifiably eager to show off the TAC, regularly brought visitors,
                    frequently including Ambassador Robert Ingersoll, when we were having a
                    particularly interesting speaker program or cultural event.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, Alan and I did not get off to a great start. Being the officer
                    charged with running the flagship operation of the whole program, I saw my
                    responsibilities as divided between those of salesman/cheer-leader on the one
                    hand and internal reporter of system glitches on the other. In the latter role,
                    I was following one of Barry's management principles to the effect that a
                    certain error rate in any new endeavor is to be expected, and no one should be
                    surprised that things don't work 100% as planned. Alan, however, clearly wanted
                    me to be a whole-hearted enthusiast, even in our internal discussions. Early on
                    concluding that I was entirely too negativand perhaps suspecting, completely
                    wrongly, that I was bitching back-channel to his arch-rival, Dan OleksiAlan
                    started an office folder to document my transgressions, his secretary told
                    me.</p>
                <p>The low point was a BPAO conference in Kyoto, where Alan and I had several
                    acrimonious exchanges during what were supposed to be relaxing social
                    occasionover, as I remember, some rather minor problems I had identified. The
                    arguments didn't bother me so much, as I knew Barry felt my criticisms raised
                    issues that needed to be addressed. What I literally lost sleep ovefrom fear
                    that, if found out, I would be fired or at least severely reprimandewas a
                    serious mistake I had made before leaving for the conference. Foolishly I had
                    agreed to let a Japanese avant garde theater troupe use the TAC programming
                    space for a performance the same weekend we were all to be in Kyoto. I should
                    have checked more closely to find out what was in their performance, because the
                    same night Alan and I had our worst argument, back at the TAC a show was
                    presented with a scene in which sympathetically-portrayed PLO soldiers paraded
                    around the stage, their rifles at the ready to confront the Israeli enemy. I
                    never should have permitted such a deviation from policy and good sense. I
                    prayed that none of my bosses would ever get wind of my mistakand fortunately
                    they never did.</p>
                <p>Later that first fall I organized some impressive seminars at the TAC, and put on
                    a week-long video art festival that was the largest of its kind that had been
                    held anywhere in the world up to that point. Having seen that I really was a
                    positive force and an asset to his program, Alan's attitude toward me mellowed.
                    A month or so later his secretary told me Alan had instructed her to remove and
                    destroy the special file he had been keeping on me.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sorts of activities did you have at the center?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: We put on lots of speaker programs, seminars, co-sponsored off-site
                    conferences, exhibitions, films shows, and even a few concerts. I was aided by a
                    terrific staff, with 22 Japanese Foreign Service Nationals and a Deputy Center
                    Director, first Mike Haller and then Carol Ludwig. Among the many outstanding
                    FSNs, I was closest to the wise veteran who served as the TAC's senior FSN,
                    Kinji Ando, to arts specialist Kyoko Michishita, and to Matsuko Kyoto, who was
                    the number two in the Infomat. Other notable staffers were programmers Mr. Soga,
                    Mr. Kubo, and Ms. Tatara, chief librarian Mr. Fukuda, and the administrative
                    genius Mr. Kitazawa, who regularly assured me that he would “leave nothing to
                    chance.” All the FSNs were thoroughly professional, dedicated to making the new
                    arrangement work, and so cohesive that I could hand them a knotty planning
                    problem in the confidence that after mulling it over they would present me with
                    a workable solution to consider.</p>
                <p>The TAC generally had two or three programs a week. In all, I think I presided
                    over more than 200 separate speaker events during my three years in the job. The
                    first program I handled featured Mike Armacost, who was Ambassador to Japan
                    during my second tour there, talking about regional security issues. We had many
                    prominent experts in all fields. For example, Paul Samuelson, the great
                    economist who “wrote the book” the one we all used when we studied basic
                    economics. On the arts side, we had Isamu Noguchi and Louise Nevelson speak at
                    the center, did a big event honoring the work of Sam Francis, who was living
                    near the TAC at the time, and even cosponsored an event that brought Andy Warhol
                    to Tokyo.</p>
                <p>In addition to the challenges of running the Tokyo American Center, I was also
                    designated the Embassy's Cultural Attache. Alan felt that position and the
                    access it afforded should go to the TAC Director rather than the Cultural
                    Affairs Officer working out of the Embassy. Having those two hats, I was invited
                    to a great many cultural eventperformances, exhibits, avant guard film showings,
                    and the like. Thanks to the great contacts that Warren Obluck had developed,
                    particularly among composers and print artists, I was relatively quickly able to
                    establish myself as a reasonably plausible member of Tokyo's cultural
                    community.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>BLACKBURN: There were many difficult onerelating to the Vietnam War, to our
                    sudden opening to China, to increasing trade frictions, and so obut the
                    Watergate crisis certainly put us in a strange public affairs situation. The
                    Japanese generally were quite high on Nixon, despite the “Nixon shocks” relating
                    to China and our unpegging the dollar-yen exchange rate. They thought Nixon was
                    a tough, effective Cold War leader. In Tokyo, as elsewhere in Japan and around
                    the world, USIS officers suddenly found themselves in the odd position of
                    explaining why our president's transgressions were so serious many Americans had
                    determined that he should be thrown out of office. My Japanese contacts, no
                    matter how versed they were in “American studies,” simply could not grasp what
                    was going on. They kept asking me if there wasn't really some sexual or
                    financial scandal behind it all. I tried to explain the seriousness of Nixon's
                    alleged participation in the Watergate cover-up, and to use the crisis as a way
                    of informing Japanese about the arcane workings of our political system. Despite
                    our efforts, the Japanese continued to view the cover-up as a very small matter
                    that had been blown way out of proportion by Nixon's mean-spirited and
                    opportunistic enemies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds like you had a great time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Well, it certainly was an enormously stimulating period in my life. I
                    became well informed about all sorts of things and met many fascinating Japanese
                    as well as American who participated in our events. In other ways, it was a
                    humbling experience. Perhaps influenced by the Japanese penchant for
                    self-criticism, I became vividly aware of my inadequacies. I soon realized that
                    I would never really know that much about the subjects my speakers were
                    addressing. I could never keep up with all the must-read books and magazines
                    flowing into our Infomat. When we would have a high-profile speaker with us for
                    a couple of days, like the novelist John Gardner, I made time to read two or
                    three of his novels, but that meant I couldn't fully prepare for other speakers
                    in the same time framperhaps experts on alternative energy sources,
                    international trade theory, or Sino-Soviet relations. I also realized that my
                    Japanese was not as fluent as I wanted it to be, and that I was not seeing as
                    much of my contacts as I wanted to. To keep from being too hard on myself, I had
                    to keep telling myself that I was just there to do the best job I could under
                    the circumstanceand not to expect any more than that.</p>
                <p>Tragically, this tendency toward excessive self-criticism when working as an AC
                    Director became pathological in the case of my friend and counterpart in Nagoya,
                    John Lepperwho took his own life while en route to a direct-transfer assignment
                    as CAO in Jakarta. John sent pathetic suicide notes to his bosses, including PAO
                    Bill Miller, who had by then replaced Alan Carter, apologizing for having done
                    such a poor job in Nagoya. We all realized after the fact that John had for some
                    time been crying out for help in different ways, but that we hadn't heard him. I
                    felt terrible about it, and was quite angry at those in the USIS chain of
                    command who should have been more responsive to his pleas. These were the days
                    before we had psychiatrists available to our overseas posts. Currently, there is
                    one assigned to Tokyo.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Yes. I think we all had the same feelings to some extent, but he quite
                    clearly went over the edge. He said in his letters that he felt he had done a
                    terrible job as Nagoya AC Director, but we alincluding his supervisorthought he

                    felt so helpless. I am still in regular touch with John's widow, Hemlata, who

                        Washington, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Indeed it was. In addition to those in USIA whose feathers Alan had
                    ruffled over the years and were happy to take potshots at him, many in the
                    Agency were genuinely concernein some cases even alarmed, at what they
                    understood to be going on there. Jim Moceri was sent out by Agency management to
                    have a look at the USIS Japan program and see if it should be, A, strangled in
                    its bed; B, kept alive but applied only to the peculiar conditions of Japan; or
                    C, used as a template for changes elsewhere in USIA's world. After conducting
                    his mini-inspection of the post, Moceri concluded that while the program may
                    have had some validity in Japan, it contained deeply serious flaws. It was, he
                    said, much too mechanistic, it didn't take adequate account of local
                    sensitivities, and it didn't place proper emphasis on warm personal friendships,
                    especially with intellectuals. I am not doing justice to his critique, but I
                    believe that was the gist of it. Alan was summoned back to Washington for what
                    some called a “star chamber hearing” to respond to Moceri's criticisms.
                    According to those who attended, it was among the most dramatic confrontations
                    in the Agency's history. People stood along the walls of the packed conference
                    room for the four or five hours that Alan and Jim went head to head over nearly
                    every aspect of the program. The upshot was that Alan prevailed, at least as far
                    as Japan was concernewhich was all that he had been arguing for in the first
                    place. The Agency's leaders congratulated him on putting together such a fine
                    and carefully considered program, but reserved judgment about its applicability
                    elsewhere.</p>
                <p>As it happened, many of Alan's innovations did spread to other countries in the
                    following yearfor example, using modern design to draw trendy young audiences to
                    the USIS centers, placing emphasis on getting the most up-to-date reference
                    materials into the hands of key contacts, and instituting more rigorous
                    distribution systems. In addition, USIS Japan's targeted speaker program, and
                    the heavy demands it put on disparate Washington elements, prompted a full
                    revamping of USIA's field program support apparatus, carried out under the
                    leadership of Chas Freeman and Ed Schulick.</p>

                <p>PAOs who came to Japan later, even those like Cliff Forster who had been early
                    critics of the Carter approach, actually changed very few of the basic
                    programming elements, as I saw for myself when I returned to Tokyo as PAO after
                    an absence of 17 years. Yes, the beanbag chairs were gone. The Infomat had
                    become an Information Resource Center. We had gone back to having an Information
                    Officer, instead of a Media Relations Officer, and the Cultural Attache
                    portfolio belonged to the Cultural Affairs Officer. The Audience Record System,
                    now the DRS, was more sophisticated. And we had started having each AC book
                    collection concentrate on a specific theme, and no longer insisted that a book
                    be thrown out for every one that was added. More important was what was kepthe
                    attention to carefully selected audiences, the dedication to constant upgrading
                    of communications and A/V support technology, and a willingness to pass up
                    activities that were “nice to do” in favor of a disciplined focus on our primary
                    objectives. This approach continues to this day, under the leadership of another
                    “true believer” from the old days, PAO Hugh Hara.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's see now, where did you go after Japan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: I went back to the Agency to work on the Inspection staff. It was a
                    little early for another Washington assignment, but I needed to go back for
                    family reasons. Dan Oleksiw was Chief Inspector and took me on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was that like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: It was exciting going back to work for my former mentor, who I joined
                    on quite a few inspections during those two years. I got a chance to inspect 22
                    different programs, all but one of theHong Konoutside of East Asia. The job took
                    me to some fascinating places I never otherwise would have seen. It was like
                    having an intense “mini career.”</p>
                <p>There's nothing like going to a post as an inspector. Everybody is nice to you,
                    they introduce you to the most fascinating people they know, and they expose you
                    to the most interesting places, the best restaurants, and so on. I got to South
                    Africa, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Brazil, Argentina, Egypt, Sudan, Turkey, Greece,
                    the United Kingdoall sorts of important posts. It was a wonderful education, and
                    I was deeply impressed with so many of the people I met and the dedication and
                    skill they applied to the programs they were carrying oufor example, PAOs like
                    Terry Catherman, Art Hoffman, Lyle Copman, and Mike Pistor.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>South Africa, Egypt, and Yugoslavia were particularly fascinating. I was
                    especially blown away by the 1976 USIS South Africa program, which we inspected
                    just before the outbreak of the momentous Soweto riots. The USIS officers and
                    FSNs were using exchanges, center programs, and large representational events to
                    develop terrific relations with key figures in all the racial groupmaking
                    friends for the U.S. and also helping lay the groundwork for positive change in
                    that country.</p>
                <p>Though we were ready to offer praise, and often did, we were also at the posts to
                    address problemones raised by Washington elements or the post itself, or ones we
                    ourselves stumbled upon. Sometimes our analysis was harsh, and I think that on
                    occasion we were probably more critical than we needed to be. There certainly
                    weren't any white-washes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the benefits of the inspections process? The
                        follow through, I thought, was always questionable on inspections?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: That was true is some cases, but the inspections I went on often led
                    to real improvements, some of them quite major, in post operations. It was often
                    rightly said that the most useful aspect of any inspection was the preparation
                    the post's staff had to go through before the inspectors even showed up at their
                    doorstep. They would complete an elaborate check list that would force them to
                    think carefully about what they were doinwith their publications, their cultural
                    programs, their management, and so on. When we arrived at the post, we would get
                    both the checklist and an “inspection memorandum” that presented the PAO's take
                    on the post. He or she would describe both the strengths of the program and also
                    problem areas that merited special attention during the inspection.</p>
                <p>In those days inspections were more subjective than they are today. They focused
                    heavily on broad issues of program management and post morale. Currently there
                    is much more emphasis on checking to ensure that regulations are being followed,
                    and to identify “waste, fraud and abuse.” Though even then people complained
                    that we were too willing to shoot from the hip, we did in fact try to be
                    objective and to carefully document any criticisms. And I think the inspections
                    were quite useful to the posts.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>To my surprise, I found that many officers at our posts, especially small ones,
                    were sincerely happy to have us there. These people were often lonely,
                    overstressed from trying to meet every requirement laid on them by their PAOs,
                    DCMs, or Ambassadors, and glad to find a reasonably sympathetic ear. They
                    welcomed the chance to talk at length about their accomplishments and also to
                    think through problems they may have been having with their bosses, those they
                    were trying to supervise, or their support offices back in Washington. I had
                    many long conversations with American officers and FSN colleagues. Sometimes
                    they took my advice, sometimes not. In vain I urged one young officer to quit
                    the Foreign Service and pursue a career path better suited to his decidedly
                    un-bureaucratic talents. Unfortunately, he was later forced, over his strenuous
                    resistance, to take that path by an Agency performance evaluation panel. But
                    even he, as well as many others, clearly appreciated the personal approach and
                    well-intentioned attitude of many of the inspectors of that day.</p>
                <p>Sometimes our formal recommendations as well as our informal briefings had
                    immediate impact. In a few cases officers were removed from posts as a result of
                    our inspections, while in otherlike the counseling I gave on operating audience
                    record systemchanges came about naturally and thus merited hardly any mention in
                    the final report.</p>
                <p>In the USIS Hong Kong inspection team leader Jim Rentschler and I recommended
                    that the post cease publishing Current Scene, an English-language publication
                    used to describe recent developments in the People's Republic of China. Drawing
                    on the results of a survey of all USIS posts, which rated it the least useful of
                    all Agency products, we said that it no longer served its original intention.
                    During that era Bill Payeff was heading East Asia. At a meeting USIA Director
                    Jim Keogh had with our inspection team, Bill argued strongly for keeping the
                    magazine afloat, basically saying that we inspectors didn't know what we were
                    talking about. A few months after that meeting, with Payeff's support, the
                    Agency abolished Current Scene, citing our recommendation as a major reason for
                    the decision! That was not an uncommon inspection scenario.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was in Hong Kong then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: The PAO was Jack Friedman. He was one of the extremely rare cases when
                    a State Department officer with no USIA experience was assigned as a PAO. Though
                    Jack was very dedicated, his lack of familiarity with the arcane array of Agency
                    products, programs, regulations, and hidden pots of money made it difficult for
                    him to operate as effectively as he might have. Since consolidation, with
                    considerable interchange between officers in all the cones, the Department has
                    done a much better job of basic public diplomacy training for officers such as
                    Jack Friedman.</p>

                <p>BLACKBURN: It had a major influence on my understanding of how USIA really did
                    its business around the world. It also gave me a chance to think about the
                    different management styles that mighor certainly would nowork for me. I also
                    made some deep friendships, both at the posts and with other inspectors. The
                    experience, in addition, steeped me deeply in the process itselso much so that
                    when it came my turn to be inspected at each of the four posts where I served as
                    PAO, none of those inspections turned up anything but very minor failings.</p>
                <p>SENIOR POLICY OFFICE1977-78</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This brings us to the point, does it not, where you went
                        into the policy guidance shop just as CU had come out of the State
                        Department to be combined with USIA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Yes, that was 1977, the first year of the Carter Administration. I
                    went into the new policy office set up at that time. John Reinhardt was USIA
                    Director and Charlie Bray was Deputy, while Hal Schneidman was the Associate
                    Director for Programs and Policy, I believe it was called, with Alan Carter was
                    his deputy. Technically, and performance evaluation-wise, I worked for first Gib
                    Austin and then Dick Roth, but basically I reported directly to Alan Carter for
                    the next three years. It seems I shuttled constantly back and forth between Alan
                    and Dan Oleksiw. Anyway, Hal and Alan wanted to invigorate the “long-term
                    policy” offica hardy perennial Agency objectivby bringing in Mike Schneider, me,
                    and several other mid-level officers who might offer fresh approaches.</p>
                <p>I was given the portfolio of arms control and disarmament. Though I didn't have
                    much background in the subject, to say the least, I read up on the issues and
                    manfully tried to maintain liaison with the real experts at State, ACDA, and the
                    NSwith some contact with Defense, as well. In the first flush of the Carter
                    Administration, these issues were high on the agenda. There were many
                    initiatives on the table regarding test bans, strategic negotiations with the
                    Soviet Union, non-proliferation, limitations on arms transfers, and a great many
                    issues to be addressed at the so-called “SSOD,” the U.N. Special Session on
                    Disarmament. My job was to try to understand the issues and to help our posts
                    deal with them in the field. It was interesting enough, but USIA was very far on
                    the sidelines, there was not a great deal for our media elements and overseas
                    posts to do to advance our policies, and the initiatives themselves quickly ran
                    out of gas in most cases. For example, rather than viewing the SSOD as a great
                    forum for advancing a global disarmament and arms control agenda, the security
                    community's approach to it became a “damage limitation” operation.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>While in that office I was given an additional assignmento produce a new version
                    of our traditional annual Country Plan instruction, one that would be
                    appropriate for the USIA-CU merger that had just taken place. I worked on it in
                    tandem with Barry Fulton, who by then was doing strategic planning for the
                    restructured Agency. Developing the new approach was more complicated than we
                    had expected it to be, because it soon became apparent that USIA and CU had
                    structured their annual plans quite differently over the years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's be systematic about this. I never had much to do
                        with this sort of thing in the Agency. Can you go into some detail about
                        what you are referring to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: The USIA Country Plan would start out with an analysis of the policy
                    framework and then describe those attitudes toward the United States and our
                    policies that needed priority attention in the context of the bilateral
                    relationship. It would state specific themes that would be used to address
                    misunderstandings oor outright opposition tour policies in priority areas of
                    concern such as trade, relations with the USSR, and so oas well as aspects of
                    American politics, values, culture, etc. that needed to be highlighted. Then we
                    would talk about the key audience groups to which we wanted to deliver our
                    messages. That was the way a traditional USIA Country Plan would look. Its
                    objectives were concrete and reasonably substantive, pointing toward achieving
                    some sort of specific result.</p>
                <p>In contrast, a CU Country Plan would focus less on the substance of specific
                    messages and much more on processes that would play out over the long term. Its
                    analysis of the programming environment would emphasize areas that needed to be
                    treated by dialogue and exchanges aimed at increased understanding by the U.S.
                    as well as the host country. It might specify fields like international trade,
                    urban planning, or literature, and call for increased numbers of Fulbright
                    student grantees, scholarly symposia, joint research, or academic affiliations
                    in those fields. Often the “American learning process” and ensuring that U.S.
                    academic interests were served was considered just as important as building
                    support for our immediate foreign policy objectives. The CU objective was to
                    devote appropriate levels of resources to advancing U.S. national interests over
                    the long term. Because of Senator J. William Fulbright's desire for this
                    approach, he had long opposed any merger of the more high-minded CU with what he
                    saw as propagandistic USIeven though both efforts were run out of our same USIS
                    offices at posts abroad.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>Many in CU had hoped to keep on doing exchanges planning as before, but Reinhardt
                    and Bray insisted on melding the two approaches. I was the lead person trying to
                    find accommodation between the traditional USIA people on the one hand and the
                    keepers of the CU flame on the other. Over several weeks we looked at various
                    optionsuch as a CU-type portion of a USIA-type plan, adding exchanges “messages”
                    and short-term purposes to the old USIA plan, and loosening the language of each
                    type of plan, but keeping them pretty separate. These are just some examples of
                    what we considered. In the end, after I had shuffled many drafts between the
                    former CU planners, Barry Fulton, Alan Carter, and Charlie Bray, we found
                    workable compromises that met most needs in that first year and laid the
                    groundwork for future refinements.</p>
                <p>Another planning exercise was closer to my heart and produced a more satisfactory
                    result, at least intellectually. That was the work Barry and I did in
                    conceptualizing an “influence structure analysis” exercise. Although lists of
                    key institutions had been a part of Barry's audience record system from the
                    beginning, we had never before had an analytical approach for identifying them
                    and relating them to the individuals in the system. Posts needed this kind of
                    rigor in order to set priorities among types of institutions, among offices,
                    faculties, and other sub-groups within institutions, and among categories of
                    individuals (like some students) for whom we might not keep individual records.
                    These key institutions would get post attention for cosponsored programs,
                    International Visitor Grant nominations, reference center outreach, and
                    recruitment of audiences for programs and representational events. Dan Oleksiw,
                    citing inspection results demonstrating a need for such an exercise, and Alan
                    Carter, who was ready to accept the idea from the get-go, both gave impetus to
                    our efforts. However, the two of theever wary of the othewanted some control
                    over how our exercise would turn out. They finally settled on a compromise:
                    anything Barry said was okay Alan would agree to, and anything I said was okay
                    Dan would sign off on. That was just fine with Barry and me. The heavy sledding
                    came when the two of us tried to reach agreement. But after many “struggle
                    sessions” we produced the “Influence Structure Analysis Guidelines.” Though it
                    sounds dry and bureaucratic from this vantage, the document was widely praised
                    as an excellent planning instrument. Eventually used by virtually all USIS, it
                    was never improved on over a period of two decades. I understand it is still
                    referred to and kept current at quite a few embassies even now, some 25 years
                    later.</p>
                <p> OF FAST POLICY GUIDANC1978-80</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What brought about your move to “fast policy” guidance?
                        Somebody left, I suppose.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: First let me explain that “fast guidance” was, I believe, an Alan
                    Carter-ism. The term brought some good-natured derisioaimed mainly at the guy
                    with the phrase in his title, mbut actually made the useful distinction that
                    this was an office focused exclusively on day-to-day guidances such as would be
                    used by the State Department Spokesman and our press attaches in the field.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>I was moved in the summer of 1978 to fill a gap. I replaced a terrific policy
                    officer named Jim Thurber, whose able deputy, Harry Iceland, fortunately stayed
                    on through my first year on the job. Harry was replaced by another excellent
                    officer, George Kinzer, and we were given great staff assistance by ever-helpful
                    Marg Davy. At the time, Hodding Carter was Spokesman, and a marvelous one he
                    was. As the USIA liaison with Hodding, I had a bird's eye view of the latter
                    part of the Carter Administratiothe depressing Iran hostage crisis and the
                    Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, as well as the encouraging breakthrough when we
                    established formal relations with the People's Republic of China. I was on the
                    phone with the State Department Press Office off and on during the day and went
                    over to the Department for the daily noon briefing - and the meetings in
                    Hodding's office that preceded and followed it. My job was not only to get the
                    straight word on current policy, but on behalf of USIA to raise concerns about
                    how our pitches would play overseas, the urgency of getting policy materials to
                    the field, or more parochial issues such as pushing for seats for VOA
                    Correspondents and Wireless File writers when Secretary Vance or Secretary
                    Muskie traveled overseas.</p>
                <p>I held morning and afternoon meetings in my office with USIA area office and
                    media policy officers. In the brief morning sessions I gave them a heads-up on
                    the hot items in U.S. foreign affairs, and in the afternoon I provided an
                    insider perspective on what reasoning, sensitivities, and organizational
                    compromises had led to the wording of the guidances we were all instructed to
                    follow.</p>
                <p>Another role I played was as the primary point of foreign policy contact with the
                    Voice of Americon behalf not only of the Agency but also, at least in theory, of
                    the State Department and National Security Council. The idea was that VOA would
                    carry out its responsibilities, as laid out in the “VOA Charter,” without
                    interference from other parts of the government. I was the gatekeeper for
                    outsider contacts with VOA. If any Ambassador or State or Agency policy officer
                    had any complaint or advice to offer, it was supposed to come to me for passing
                    along as appropriate. If a factual mistake was picked up by a USG listener, I
                    was to be called immediately, night or day. Some of those came along in the wee
                    hours of the morning, and I immediately notified the VOA Newsroom, which took
                    appropriate action to correct or pull the item.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>On the other hand, if the issue was one of news treatment or perceived deficiency
                    in supporting our policy, that was a different matter entirely. Those
                    interventions had to be handled gingerly. If anyone questioned VOA's authority
                    to use its own news judgment, I would explain to the complainer that pushing
                    U.S. policies was not a function of VOA newbut rather a job handled by what were
                    then known as “VOA Commentaries.” These segments, which in an earlier
                    incarnation were called “VOA News Analyses” or “VOA Backgrounders,” later became
                    the “VOA Editorials” we hear today. Excellent analysts like Howard J. Dunlevy
                    bylined the earlier pieces, but these segments purported only to reflect the
                    views of their writers. In replacing all such opinion pieces with the
                    Commentaries, VOA now had a vehicle for getting out officiaand cleareU.S.
                    policy.</p>
                <p>My office was in charge of getting the needed clearances. We also passed along
                    policy documents and treatment suggestions to VOA policy officers, for
                    transmission to the actual VOA writers of the pieces. Of course, we had
                    disagreements almost daily. The Voice of America people insisted that it was
                    essential to use “radio language” to effectively defend our policies, but that
                    approach often ran smack into the face of staid, often extremely “nuanced,”
                    State Department formulations. East Asia Area Director Mort Smith, as well as
                    his State Department counterparts, would get apoplectic about phraseology the
                    VOA writers wanted to use in talking about our China policy. Middle East policy
                    was another hot potato. I would look at the draft commentaries and tried to find
                    a middle ground between, on the one hand, the textual purists of the State
                    Department and, on the other hand, the VOA professionals trying to convey our
                    policies in a clear and “listenable” manner attractive to foreign radio
                    audiences. Given the different approaches, I think we actually made the system
                    work pretty well. In the Reagan Administration, after I had left the job, the
                    policy purists won the day. Now, except for the occasional out-of-school piece,
                    we have “VOA Editorials” that explicitly enunciate polices of the U.S.
                    Government. Sadly, they are widely considered boring as well as so blatantly
                    propagandistic as to undermine VOA's credibility and competitiveness with the
                    BBC and other Western international broadcasters.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>My “fast guidance” job also included liaison with the White House on policy
                    issues of all types. Besides day-to-day concerns, for example, I represented
                    USIA at highly classified discussions about what the U.S. was going to counter
                    the Soviets in Afghanistan. However, my main interactions with the White House
                    were in connection with presidential and vice-presidential trips overseas, for
                    which I was the Agency's senior coordinator. In that capacity, I would get an
                    early heads up on planned travel and spread the word internally as to what
                    specific types of non-routine press support the White House wanted from us. A
                    constant message the White House Press Office told me to pass along was: “Make
                    sure your USIS people in the field understand that WE are in charge of this
                    trip. Nothing is to be done without OUR say-so. We want all-out supporno
                    whining, no special pleading, and no arguments about our decisions. Within these
                    strict ground rules we realize there may be some local sensitivities we are not
                    aware of, so will listen to a very limited number of pertinent suggestions
                    passed to us one-on-one from the PAO on the ground.” The Carter press advance
                    people were sometimes a pain to deal with, but fortunately they had by those
                    years gained more competence and confidence than they had initially
                    displayed.</p>
                <p>I had helped out with President Lyndon Johnson's visit to Bangkok in 1966, and
                    worked at the USIS press center when President Ford visited Tokyo in 1974 or
                    1975, but this was up close and personal. Though I usually did not go along for
                    the actual trips, I did join a “pre-advance” to Mexico City, and then got deeply
                    involved in Vice President Walter Mondale's high-profile trip to China in 1979.
                    The lattea real kicgave me my first look at the PRC. I was there for three
                    weeks, helping both the White House and our new China post on a trip that took
                    Mondale to Xian and Guangzhou as well as Beijing. John Thompson was the PAO, Ted
                    Liu the CAO, and Bill Stubbs the IO. They were a great team, but were already
                    over-worked and clearly needed Agency help in handling a Vice Presidential
                    visit. The formal bilateral relationship was only a year old, Deng Xiao-ping had
                    just had a very successful visit to the United States, exchanges were expanding
                    exponentially, a large foreign press corps had taken up residence in Beijing,
                    and the Chinese were all over us with expressions of friendship and thanks for
                    such products as the VOA Chinese Service. But USIS had almost no infrastructure
                    other than what could be provided at long distance from USIS Hong Kong. Ted and
                    Bill lived in small rooms at the Beijing Hotel, and Ted's office was a converted
                    bathroom that still had tiles on the wallmaking for very loud conversations!</p>
                <p>Though I didn't actually meet Mondale during the trip, I was very impressed with
                    his performance and got plenty of exposure to some of his people supporting the
                    triincluding his excellent press assistant, Maxine Isaacs, who later became
                    cosponsor of the Kennedy Center's Millennium Stage, and Bob Toricelli, who led
                    the advance team in Xian and later was elected to the House and Senate from New
                    Jersey. Some of the political people were nice and capable, while others were
                    difficult. It didn't much matter to me, though, as I was just thrilled to be in
                    Chinand to have the chance to help set up Mondale's televised speech at Peking
                    University, to attend two banquets at the Great Hall of the People, to watch the
                    start of meetings between Mondale and Deng Xiao-ping, and otherwise to be a part
                    of such a momentous visit.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>I badly fluffed one responsibility I was given, I must confess. That was to take
                    charge of the “mult box” that the correspondents all plugged into to get their
                    sound recordings of press conference proceedings. So that there wouldn't be a
                    forest of microphones on the table in front of Mondale at his farewell press
                    conference in Beijing, the journalists were all told to rely on the mult box.
                    Unfortunately, despite our assurances and what I thought had been adequate
                    pre-testing, it turned out that I must not have connected things quite right, as
                    nothing at all went through it. I felt really stupid, and panicked at the
                    thought that we would have nothing on which to base our official transcript of
                    the event. Mercifully, Jim Sterba of the New York Times had had his tape
                    recorder on and picked up a very, very faint recording. That night secretary and
                    “angel of mercy” Delores Boyer and I were able, word by painstaking word, to
                    reproducwith a few “inaudibles” here and thera plausible transcript of the
                    proceedings. I still shudder to think how close I was to the potential disaster
                    of having no transcript at all for that important press conference.</p>

                <p>BLACKBURN: Yes, the China trip was my last major Fast Policy Guidance task, and a

                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: I was very happy to be assigned as PAO to Malaysia. I had been
                    fascinated by the country when I first visited it in 1963, and then in 1970 had
                    briefly done dissertation research there on the Malaysian media. On that latter
                    visit I stayed with Jodie Lewinsohn in the grand PAO mansion that I later
                    “inherited.” Not only was I pleased with the job, I was nearly ecstatic that I
                    would be living in an abode with a clay tennis court in its front yard.</p>
                <p>Before I left for Kuala Lumpur I calleon successive dayon USIA Director John
                    Reinhardt and East Asia Area Director Jodie Lewinsohn. After saying they thought
                    K.L. was an excellent first PAO assignment for me, each had quite different
                    advice about my dealings with the Malaysian FSNs. John said I should exercise
                    strong leadership and try to overcome my tendency to be too easy going and
                    lenient with FSN employees. In contrast, Jodie said she feared that, because I
                    was so awfully stubborn, I would be too demanding and pushy with the staff, so
                    should go easy on them. I never did figure out which one had me sized up
                    accuratelperhaps they both had!</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>Malaysia was an ideal place to begin my 15 years as a PAO. For starters, support
                    from my AmbassadorBarbara Watson, Ron Palmer, and Tom Shoesmitand my DCMLyall
                    Brecken and Mike Connorcould not have been better, and the American and FSN
                    staffs were highly competent. A complete turnover of American staff accompanied
                    my arrival at the post to replace Wes Fenhagen. Tony Sariti came in as CAO, Edie
                    Russo as IO, and Joann Quinton as EO. Craig Stromme, then the JOT, returned as
                    CAO my last year in K.L. and much later joined me in the EAP Public Diplomacy
                    Office. Among the many standout FSNs were cultural specialist Sharifah Zuriah
                    Al-jeffrie, senior FSN advisor Selvendra Rajendrum, IV/exchanges specialist
                    Dorothy David, librarian Sophia Lim, and my secretary, Helen Lee, who later
                    became the DRS specialist and was replaced by Tina Chee.</p>
                <p>I learned to chair a binational Fulbright commissiothe Malaysian American
                    Commission for Educational Exchange, or MACEand I enjoyed interacting with the
                    excellent contacts my predecessors and the FSNs had developed at all levels of
                    the society. In my first months on the ground, I met political leaders from all
                    the major parties, the educational and cultural elites, and revered figures such
                    as the country's first Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, and the President of
                    the High (Supreme) Court, Tun Suffian. The latter had been an Eisenhower
                    Exchange Fellow and chaired the EEF selection committee.</p>
                <p>It was exciting to work in a country with such a rich racial composition. Both
                    the post's DRS and our USIS staff reflected the tapestry of Malays, Chinese and
                    IndianMuslims, Buddhists, Hindus and Christianthat is Malaysia. Although the
                    USIS FSNs were by and large excellent and worked together well considering their
                    disparate backgrounds, I had to handle some challenging management problems.
                    When easing out certain long-time staffers and tightening up procedures, I tried
                    to apply lessons learned from my inspecting days.</p>
                <p>Americans in Malaysia at that time enjoyed a special status. American investors
                    were setting up semi-conductor factories in large numbers, military cooperation
                    was close, and the Malaysian Government was sending the cream of its Malay
                    students on undergraduate and graduate scholarships to American universities.
                    People wanted to meet Americans, and took pains to explain to us the ins and
                    outs of Malaysian society and politictypically from the ethnic perspective of
                    the particular speaker. And, best of all, they did it in fluent English, a fact
                    I appreciated after having been at sea so often in conversations in Thai and
                    Japanese during my previous assignments.</p>

                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Malaysian officials, like then Education Minister Musa Hitam, and our
                    Embassy paid considerable attention to the Malay students in U.S. academic
                    programs, especially those who had gone on to study in America. Typically they
                    were young and impressionable. Often they had negative reactions to the
                    permissive environments in which they suddenly found themselves, and for which
                    they were not well prepared. Some analysts believe that Islamic radicalism in
                    today's Malaysia got its first major impetus from disillusioned Malay students
                    who were part of that big wave that went to the U.S. Though we recognized such
                    dangers at the time, overall we thought that having thousands of bright young
                    Malays go to the U.S. was an exciting and hopeful development. Our USIS Country
                    Plan for Malaysia even included promotion of educational linkages as a major
                    objective, nearly up there with our security and trade goals. The focus of the
                    post on advising U.S.-bound students led us to hire Marti Thomson, who first ran
                    the volunteer-based student advising operation at MACEE and then became the
                    firsand most distinguishe“Regional Educational Advising Counselor” for USIA and
                    later the State Department.</p>
                <p>Besides promoting educational exchanges and linkages, I spearheaded the formation
                    of the Malaysian Association of American Studies, an organization that continues
                    to flourish to this day.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't a new U.S. Embassy constructed in Kuala Lumpur
                        about this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Yes, it was completed in 1983. All USIS facilities, including our
                    off-site “Lincoln Center,” were moved into the new building. I developed a
                    public affairs strategy aimed at both showing off the new facilitwhich had a
                    terrific design that incorporated Malaysian motifs and did not give one the
                    impression of being the fortress it really waand encouraging in-person and
                    off-site usage of the library holdings and reference services we had brought
                    over from the Lincoln Center. In carrying out the latter objective, Sophia Lim
                    developed and implemented a brilliant outreach strategy that later was used as a
                    model for other USIS posts throughout the world.</p>
                <p>To bring Malaysians comfortably into the Embassy, I dreamed up an art exhibition
                    titled “American Experiences, Malaysian Images.” It featured the work of
                    Malaysian artists who had spent time in the United States. Each artist was
                    invited to show one piece completed before going abroad, one while in the U.S.,
                    and one after returning to Malaysia. The catalogue we produced gave each artist
                    his or her own spread. It was a beautiful product, all paid for by a grant from
                    ESSO. The show was opened by a Cabinet minister and proved a great success. I
                    was so happy with the idea that I replicated it in Thailand on my next
                    assignment, though in that case with very mixed results.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>My work on the Malaysian media led me to pay particular attention to the
                    Malaysian press. I had many excellent contacts, some of whom I inherited from
                    legendary Information Officer Mike Brown and some of whom I developed on my own.
                    Helpfully, a convivial gatherinthat Mike had earlier promoteof Malaysian
                    journalists and foreign information officers was held on Friday nights at one or
                    another of the local watering spas.</p>
                <p>My marriage to Winona having come to an end by that point, I married Pek, a
                    Malaysian-Chinese academic about six months before leaving the post. Our
                    celebratory wedding dinner was held under a big tent on the fabled tennis court
                    at the PAO residence. Pek, who currently teaches at American University, takes
                    Washington-based students to Malaysia for summer courseso I feel still connected
                    to the bilateral educational exchanges I started working on during that
                    assignment.</p>
                <p>PAO BANGKO1984-88</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From Kuala Lumpur you went directly to Bangkok,
                        right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: That's right. “Directly” is definitely the appropriate word. That day
                    was certainly an emotional roller coaster. Just one hour after our emotional,
                    even tearful, farewell to friends, colleagues, and Pek's family in Malaysia, we
                    found ourselves given a joyous, open-arms welcome to Thailand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your first reactions to being back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: The first night Pek and I went out to a dinner given by the Fulbright
                    Commission to say farewell to my popular predecessor as PAO, Hal Morton. We had
                    a wonderful evening, and I remember thinking, “What a pity we'll only be here
                    for four years.”</p>
                <p>Those years were in many respects the pinnacle of my career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How so?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Perhaps because I was probably at the top of my form then. The
                    assignment permitted me to make a unique contributiobecause of my previous
                    experience in the country and my fluency in the language. No previous PAO had
                    had an earlier posting in Thailand, which is pretty amazing when you think of
                    the huge number of officers who had served there.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>By 1984 Thailand had changed tremendously from what it had been when I left in
                    the late 1960s, but the post was to a large extent still stuck in the past. In
                    fact, the Country Plan of that era led off with comments about how big a
                    psychological factor the emasculation of the Thailand field program was to
                    achieving our psychological objectives. Indeed, much was changed. We had closed
                    almost all our branches. Only USIS Chiang Mai remained as a full fledged branch
                    post. We had one FSN in Songhkla, and we eventually lost him, too. But nine
                    years after the end of the Vietnam War, and in the aftermath of convulsive
                    changes in internal Thai politics, it was certainly appropriate that we would no
                    longer have the big field presencjust as we would no longer be making movies,
                    printing posters and “tactical pamphlets,” or otherwise producing materials
                    directly supporting the Thai government.</p>
                <p>I told the Thai staff that as much as I well remembered the post's past “glory
                    days,” it was time to recognize that we were in a different period in the
                    bilateral relationship. To drive home the point I decreed, taking a leaf from
                    the USIS Japan play book and an idea I had successfully tried in Malaysia, that
                    we would redesign all of our printed materials. To start that process, I
                    initiated a logo contest for USIS staffers. I asked them to think carefully
                    about ways symbolically to represent what we were all about in 1984. We got, I
                    think, 57 entries. Some of them harkened back to the old days, using a
                    representation of Thailand's royal barge or Thai and American hands clasped in
                    USAID fashion. Others used spokes of a wheel to depict various functions. Many
                    of the ideas were interesting and even inspired, but most were easily eliminated
                    when we went to the final cut. We displayed all the entries on a large board and
                    encouraged the staff to come and discuss the pros and cons of each. In the end
                    we selected a nice wavy design that included suggestions of both the Thai and
                    American flags, and put it on all our materials. But the most important aspect
                    of the exercise, I thought, was that we raised consciousness about the fact that
                    we were in a new period of U.S.-Thai relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you operating under much more stringent budget
                        conditions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: No, not really. Happily, I was able to emphasize to the staff that
                    although the times had changed, we still had a great cadre of Thai FSNand money
                    for new initiatives was plentiful. It was a time for creativity applied in any
                    direction, including improving the dilapidated physical plant of USIS Bangkok,
                    which in those days was still located on a large and beautiful compound on South
                    Sathorn Road. Not only did USIS have its own property, which included a charming
                    building that served as the Chancery after World War II, but the Embassy had
                    decided to make it the locus for staff recreation activities. So right outside
                    our windows were the Embassy pool, two tennis courts, and a snack bar. Very
                    cushy indeed!</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>Not long after my arrival USIS Thailand had the chance to pull together on a
                    once-in-a-career challenge. It came about when the New York Philharmonic
                    Orchestra canceled a visit to Malaysia three weeks before a scheduled concert.
                    The issue had been that the Malaysians insisted on a cello piece called
                    “Schlomo: a Zionist Rhapsody” be removed from the program. When it became a big
                    issue, the New Yorkers could not back down without producing a stir among their
                    supporters, so the performance in Kuala Lumpur was scrubbed. That was when NPYO
                    manager Nick Webster called me and asked if we could somehow arrange a concert
                    in Bangkok. I told him I would do my best to get approval from the Ambassador,
                    at the time John Gunther Dean. Most such performances are set up at least a year
                    in advance, but I thought that having such a major American orchestra make an
                    unprecedented visit to Bangkok would be just the kind of event that would bring
                    out Thai leaders and make a strong statement about our bilateral relationship.
                    The Ambassador was enthusiastic and gave the effort his full supporincluding
                    paying for a large and lavish representational function at the Oriental Hotel.
                    Though it was only a single performance, the event was extraordinary in several
                    respects. First of all, Bangkok at the time had no concert hall, so we had to
                    use a large auditorium at Thammasat University, where elaborate baffles had to
                    be constructed literally overnighfollowing a rock concert the previous eveninin
                    order to produce reasonably good acoustics. To carry out the many tasks that had
                    to be done within about 15 days, we recruited legions of volunteers to help us,
                    we brought in an organization that donated logistical support, we printed a
                    fancy program, we arranged the ticket sales, we lined up Thailand's Crown Prince
                    to attend as a royal sponsor, and we raised money from American and Thai
                    companies and private benefactors. Frank Scotton, legendary in USIA as a Vietnam
                    counter-insurgency aficionado, was Cultural Affairs Officer at the time and
                    found himself, much to his amusement, leading the out-front effort to solicit
                    support from big multinational corporations in town. Many of the other American
                    and Thai staffers went all out and distinguished themselves to make it work. In
                    the end we had a great concert, the publicity was tremendous, and we raised
                    $50,000 for the Thai Red Cross. It was really quite something. I felt great
                    about it, particularly knowing that had I not had so much previous involvement
                    in Thailand, I never would have had the confidence or sure-footedness to pull it
                    off. My bosses back in Washington were very impressed, too, and said that they
                    wanted to recommend me, and my key Thai and American lieutenants, for a Superior
                    Honor Award. I replied that I thought the entire staff deserved the award and
                    would not single out a limited group. That was too much for the Agency awards
                    committee, so we had to settle for a Certificate of Appreciation to all of USIS
                    Bangkok.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't that about the time that WORLDNETs got started?
                        Were you in on that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Oh yes. A year or two after I got to Bangkok, we got one of the
                    Agency's TVRthat is, “television receive only” dishes on the USIS compound. That
                    made it possible for us to participate in the WORLDNET dialogues that Charlie
                    Wick and Al Snyder had just introduced into the USIA global structure. Their
                    main use was for long distance press conferences, for which Bangkok was one of
                    the Asian posts that allowed local correspondents to ask questions to American
                    officials talking about major security and economic issues. Under that format
                    the video was transmitted from Washington, with the overseas posts participating
                    via an audio channel. They were very exciting. The Thais were fascinated, and
                    typically one or more TV stations would give coverage to the mechanics of the
                    program, thus supplementing the substantive news value of the press conference
                    itself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the most memorable of your WORLDNETs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Hands down it was the “WORLDNET to end all WORLDNETs” if I may be so
                    immodest as to say swe staged toward the end of my tour. The concept was so far
                    out of the box most people in Washington thought, and probably still think, it
                    was simply crazy. It came about because a young Thai woman living in Los
                    Angeles, whose nickname was “Pui,” won the Miss Universe contest representing
                    Thailand. She had spent very little time in Thailand, and most Thais had never
                    met her, much less ever seen her. Everyone was thrilled she had woand extremely
                    curious to learn something about her. Some Thai television producers asked if we
                    would let them use the WORLDNET facilities to interview her. I thought it was a
                    golden opportunity to make some important points about our society, particularly
                    that a charming and beautiful, yet traditional, Thai woman resident in the U.S.
                    can thrive in our open, multiracial, friendly-to-Thailand society. The
                    Washington WORLDNET office contacted her, and shbeing aware that it would give
                    her a full hour of exposure to the Thai mediwas very willing to do it.</p>
                <p>Then the question became how to organize the interview on our end. Every
                    newspaper and every TV station wanted a piece of the action. The country's five
                    nationwide television networks each vied to carry the entire program on an
                    exclusive basis, even if they had to work out of our modest facilities on the
                    USIS compound. And they wanted to give little if any role to the print media.
                    But I insisted on maintaining controso that it would get maximum media play. I
                    insisted that this WORLDNET program would be for all of Thailand's TV stations
                    and all of the Thai print journalists, with Khun Ratana of our Radio/TV Section
                    serving as the moderator. Those wanting to ask questions would have to stand in
                    line and ask their questions in turn, alternating between print and TV
                    journalists. Finally, recognizing that our studio was much too small, one of the
                    major TV networks agreed to do the program, under our ground rules.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>The upshot was that our hour-long WORLDNET with beautiful Pui was carried live,
                    on prime time, for a complete hour on every TV station in Thailand. From 8 to 9
                    P.M. that night the only choice before the Thai television viewer, anywhere in
                    the country, was to watch Pui answer questions. There was nothing else on! None
                    of the five networks had wanted to be left out of the action. Pui deftly
                    answered all the softball questionfor example, about missing Thailand and being
                    eager to greet her fans there, but at the same time expressing a deep love for
                    America, which had been so good to her. Pretty fluffy content, but still a
                    positive portrait of our country that was quite different from the usual media
                    emphasis on American crime, narcotics addiction, sexual promiscuity, and
                    violence. Besides the saturation TV coverage, the WORLDNET was on the front
                    pages of all Thai newspapers the following morning.</p>
                <p>By any measure, the program was extremely successful. And it had cost us
                    practically nothing. If there has ever been another WORLDNET carried live and in
                    full during prime time on every station in a single country, I never heard of
                    it. But of course there were people back in Washington who were horrified at
                    this whole thing. They thought it was a big waste of whatever time and money had
                    been put into it.</p>

                <p>BLACKBURN: You, too? Yes, I was criticizeboth by feminists and by what I call
                    “WORLDNET purists” for making a mockery of the WORLDNET medium by using it for a
                    dialogue with a Miss Universe winner. Though too plebeian a usage for their
                    taste, I still think it was a very successful program that achieved genuine
                    public affairs goals. As well as being great fun!</p>

                <p>BLACKBURN: One public affairs issue which hit us right out of the blue had to do
                    with an early AIDS case that was all too close to home. In 1986 Thailand was
                    still turning a blind eye to the problem, denying that it was a present or
                    potential problem for the country. Meanwhile, many AIDS cases were reported
                    around our bases in the Philippines, suggesting there might be a flicker of
                    truth in the Communist charge that the virus for this “American disease” had
                    been developed at Fort Detrick, Maryland. Knowing that an AIDS crisis would
                    doubtless soon hit the Thai sex trade, we were anxious to demonstrate that the
                    U.S. was doing what it reasonably could to keep AIDS out of the country - for
                    example by instituting a rigorous HIV-testing regimen for sailors given shore
                    leave in Pattaya and Bangkok. The problem was that precisely at this early
                    juncture we had an HIV-positive FSO officer working in the Embassy! Although he
                    was looking sicker and sicker, he denied having AIDS and no one would challenge
                    his assertion. Finally, after being refused treatment by the leading Thai
                    hospital, he was medically evacuated to Clark Field in the Philippines. Sadly,
                    the officer died not long afterwards, but fortunately the story never hit the
                    Thai press. We were lucky on that one, but, fearing it might come out, I decided
                    to discuss the general issue of Thailand's handling of the AIDS question with
                    the Spokesman for the Thai Foreign Ministry. Without mentioning our Embassy
                    case, I told him that it was widely known in the international community that
                    there were already a number of HIV-positive foreigners in the country, including
                    prisoners of various nationalities who had used infected needles while
                    incarcerated. Although the Thai Government might not yet want to admit to a
                    domestic AIDS problem, when they did do so, I said, I hoped they would not look
                    to blame any particular country, but instead speak of it as a tragic situation
                    affecting both Thais and resident foreigners of many nationalities. Many months
                    later, that was how the story came out, to our relief. Whether my intervention
                    had any effect or not, I still think it was good insurance during that early
                    perioa time when there was so much AIDS panic in Bangkok that many Embassy
                    employees refused to swim in our swimming pool for weeks after the infected
                    officer had used it. And after he left, the officer's bedding and furniture were
                    incinerated by the Admin Section.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>Another hot issue of the day was “yellow rain.” The U.S. had asserted that
                    Vietnamese aircraft were using biochemical agents against hill tribes in Laos,
                    and villagers gave personal accounts that seemed to corroborate the charges. The
                    public affairs problem was that there was no persuasive hard evidence to support
                    the allegationand much evidence for an alternate hypothesis that the cause of
                    the “yellow rain” was in fact droppings from swarms of bees. Neither Press
                    Attache Larry Thomas nor I felt comfortable peddling a story that seemed so
                    flimsy, so I consulted DCM Stapleton Roy about what we should do. Fortunately,
                    Stape was way ahead of us. A three man team was just being assigned to the
                    Bangkok Embassy to investigate all yellow rain charges. With Stape's guidance,
                    Larry and I were able to answer skeptical questioners by saying that the Embassy
                    took very seriously charges of Vietnamese use of biochemical agents, that we had
                    no means to verify what happened in earlier reported incidents, that we would
                    carefully investigate each new case, and that full disclosure would be given to
                    the team's findings. In the end no such proof turned up, but Stape's neat
                    formulation allowed uand the rest of the Embassy there on the grounto maintain
                    our credibility and self-respect.</p>
                <p>Besides those flaps, we gave a lot of attention to economic issuemainly relating
                    to trade, investment, and intellectual property rights. One great vehicle for
                    addressing them was a high-powered U.S.-Thailand economic seminar that USIS
                    sponsored each year over several days at a beach resort. An officer several
                    years earlier, perhaps John Reid, had started it, with the assistance of our
                    extraordinary senior FSN, M.L. Poonsaeng Sutabutr, who really made it work.</p>
                <p>Khun Poonsaeng made many things happen, and was in my view the most effective,
                    imaginative, and well connected FSN staffer I ever worked with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In any country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Yes, definitely. Anyway, the leading western-educated economists of
                    the country thought the annual economic seminar was a great event, were
                    delighted to be invited to participate, and gave it their full support. Besides
                    the stimulating interchange, they and their families appreciated the chance to
                    get out of Bangkok for a long weekend. Supachai Panichpakdi, now heading the
                    World Trade Organization, was one of two co-chairs of the Thai planning group
                    for the conference during my days there, and the sessions attracted many others
                    who weror becamsenior officials in the Thai government, including two prime
                    ministers.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>It was certainly one of the greatest USIS traditions I encountered anywhere in
                    the world. Besides the leading Thai economists, many of whom made presentations,
                    we supplied speakers from the U.S. or the American business community. Senior
                    officers in our embassy were there, too. Ambassador Dean loved it, as did his
                    successor Ambassador William Brown, because of the opportunity it afforded to
                    hobnob informally and for several days with all those top English-speaking
                    economists. And they could actively participate in a substantive seminar that
                    addressed fundamental and topical economic issues of concern to both countries.
                    It was useful all around. I believe the seminars are still held, though without
                    Khun Poonsaeng, who retired a few years ago, or some of the former luminaries on
                    the Thai side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I understand you also were involved in programming on
                        narcotics. What was that all about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Yes, we were very concerned about the flow of narcotics from the
                    Golden Triangle to the United States. At that time many Thaias well as othersaid
                    the root of the problem was “demand pull” from an out-of-control U.S. Questions
                    were raised as to why we were heavily leaning on Thailand when our country had
                    so many addicts and so many drug dealers running loose on the streets. To
                    counter these charges, I led a public affairs effort focused on serious U.S.
                    efforts to reduce demand for drugs in our schools and communities. Working with
                    Thailand's Office of Narcotics Control Board, we put together two large
                    anti-narcotics conferences that highlighted education programs, public service
                    messages, voluntary organizations, and the like in the United States, as well as
                    in Thailand and other countries in the region. The conferences, held in Cha-am
                    near Hua Hin, were both useful and well attended. Besides the USIS speakers we
                    brought from the U.S. such as grass roots activists and drug program officialwe
                    had senior attendees from the State Department, the Drug Enforcement Agency, and
                    various United Nations bodies. We got across our points very well, I thought,
                    and thus helped provide the climate for promoting more vigorous Thai actions to
                    stem the flow of narcotics passing through the country from the Golden Triangle
                    and Laos.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you still have publications at USIS Thailand at that
                        point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Not anywhere as many as before. But while I was there we
                    reinstituteSeripharb (or Free World), the magazine that we had had earlier, but
                    which had gone out of favor and had been dropped a few years before I got there.
                    I thought it was worth resurrecting, to see how well we could market it,
                    especially since we still had a very professional staff on hand to put it out.
                    With an updated image and format, the publication looked good and was a fine
                    medium for putting across our messages. It lasted several years after my
                    departure, but then died along with nearly all the other Agency publications
                    that went by the boards.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>Besides Seripharb we also had a number of publications for special purposes. For
                    example, we produced an excellent pamphlet on the USAID program in Thailand, we
                    put out study guides for university professors using American films to teach
                    about the United States, and we worked with RSC Manila on a bilingual set of
                    advisory materials for Thais and Americans participating in high school exchange
                    programs. The latter product, developed under my direction by Elizabeth Mortlock
                    and a Thai professor, was aimed at both the students and the families involved
                    in such activities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about books?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: We still had a modest book translation program, run by a marvelous FSN
                    named Khun Sukhon Polpatpicharn. To give her a boost, and to encourage more
                    attention to the translation of serious books from the U.S., we put on a two-day
                    conference on “The Joys and Sorrows of Translation” at the American University
                    Alumni Associatioor AUwhere USIS had two officers, Larry Daks and Bill Royer,
                    supporting the English teaching, library, and other programs centered there.
                    That conference was a big hit with the Thai translators, but I am not sure it
                    really led to any increased production of translated American works.</p>
                <p>Another ambitious venture of mine that didn't work out so well was the exhibition
                    of works by Thai artists who had studied in the U.S. Unfortunately, the
                    prominent Thai art critic I recruited to write the catalogue for the show chose
                    to charge the featured artists with lack of originality. Though the wording was
                    fairly mild, they took great offence when they read iafter the show's up-beat
                    opening, fortunately. The show went on, but it was far from the grand success I
                    had hoped for.</p>
                <p>More successful was my launching of the American Studies Association of Thailand,
                    an institution similar to the one I started while in Malaysia. One of the big
                    American studies events we held was a three day celebration and symposium
                    devoted to the 1987 bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like you were very involved in planning
                        events.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Yes, I think I was. There were so many opportunities to move in new
                    directions, and I had such great support from the USIS officers and FSNs that I
                    didn't need to look over their shoulders so much. CAO Frank Scotton and then
                    Ginny Ferris did a great job with speakers, exchanges, and the Fulbright
                    program. Larry Thomas was a superb Information Officer/Press Attache, followed
                    by the capable Ross Petzing. And Larry Daks was simply superb as Director of
                    AUA.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>I saw it as my job to have wide contacts in the American, expatriate, and Thai
                    communitieto spot problems and opportunities and to be able to bring people into
                    the USIS and Embassy public affairs orbit as appropriate.</p>
                <p>Among my “outside” activities was to serve on the Council of the prestigious Siam
                    Society, where I was recruited to help out with a Ford Foundation-sponsored
                    symposium on “Culture and Environment in Thailand.” That proved to be an
                    enormous undertaking. I spent many a Saturday morning over two years to plan the
                    week-long conference in Bangkok and Chiang Mai. It proved a fascinating
                    examination of how cultural forces and the environment had interacted in
                    Thailand from the dawn of recorded histortalking about the arts, the economy,
                    the ecology, and so on. Though I started on it simply because of my own
                    interests, in the end I found that it was very useful to Embassy objectives
                    relating to the environment, and gave me terrific contacts among leading Thai
                    intellectuals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much interaction with the Thai royal
                        family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Yes, I certainly did, particularly in the context of the 1988
                    celebrations of the 60th birthday of His Majesty the King of Thailand. The Thais
                    asked uas their best friends and treaty allieto do two things in the public
                    affairs line. The first was to bring a cultural troupe to participate in a
                    festival marking the opening of their new state-of-the-art cultural center. And
                    the other was to contribute a permanent structure or garden at the newly created
                    Rama IX ParRama the Ninth being part of the King's formal title. Similar
                    requests were made to other countries. It was clear that the U.S. was somehow
                    going to have to come up with a respectable showing.</p>
                <p>We did a lot of brain-storming on what type of cultural presentation would be
                    both appropriate and affordable, and lamented that we did not have the New York
                    Philharmonic hankering to come our way during that period. We knew the British
                    were bringing the Sadler Wells Ballet, the Soviet Union had laid on one of the
                    Bolshoi troupes, and the Japanese planned to perform a full-scale opera. In
                    short, expectations were very high. Finally, I came up with the idea of the
                    Preservation Hall Jazz Band from New Orleans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, like the jazz performers who came and played with the
                        King in past years?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>BLACKBURN: That's right. We thought about Lionel Hampton, who had come in the
                    '50s or '60s, as had Benny Goodman and others, but figured that might be too
                    risky. Instead, I thought Preservation Hall would be perfect, with its rather
                    old African-American performers, who liked the same type of jazz the King
                    enjoyed. So we, with help from the Arts America folks in USIA Washington, lined
                    up the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, got one of the airlines to pay for their
                    travel, found a hotel to put them up for free, and secured ESSO funding for
                    other local expenses. In the end it didn't really cost us anything except for
                    staff time. They came and performed three times to enthusiastic crowds at the
                    cultural center. His Majesty didn't show up at any of their public performances,
                    but asked them to go to his palace for a private meeting and jam session. Khun
                    Poonsaeng, whose father had been the King's private secretary, arranged
                    everythinincluding for the Ambassador, Ginny Farris, and me, and our spouses, to
                    attend the event. It was marvelous fun and a great treat to be there at Chitlada
                    Palace for the “session.” The evening was amazing in many ways. For example,
                    when His Majesty drove over to the venue for the event, he jumped out of his
                    Rolls Royce, pulled out his trumpet, and played “the King's Anthem” right there.
                    And then he went in and joyfully jammed with the band for a couple of hours,
                    mostly playing his sax. We understood that he especially appreciated being able
                    to play with high-quality performers in their 70s or 80s, as his doctors were
                    saying that it might be too hard on his heart to continue playing after passing
                    his 60th birthday. The Royal Household videotaped the entire wonderful event,
                    but did not feel it appropriate to share the tape with us. I hope someday to see
                    it, but until then I have a kind of mental videotape of the occasion etched in
                    my memory.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But wasn't that sort of an affront, for the King not to go
                        to any of the performances held in his honor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Well, no, I don't think so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Weren't the people who sponsored all those major
                        productions disappointed? Didn't they at least expect that he would attend
                        the performance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Yes, they might have thought so. But what we heard was that the King,
                    for health reasons and perhaps for other reasons, felt that he couldn't go to
                    all the performances, so it would be better not to go to any of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good logic.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>BLACKBURN: That was the reason. I don't think any performers from other countries
                    got to go to the Palace, so we and the band were highly honored. Years later I
                    dropped by Preservation Hall in New Orleans, and noticed that still prominently
                    display the poster we designed on their walls. The older performers who came to
                    Bangkok are no longer active, or have passed on, however.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened with the park request?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: The way they put it was this: “You in the Embassy represent America,
                    our ally and good friend, and we would like you to give us an American garden to
                    go along with the British garden, the Italian garden, the Japanese garden, and
                    even the Chinese garden that we have been promised by those governments.” Our
                    first question, to ourselves, was: “What the hell is an American garden anyway.”
                    The second was: “Assuming we can come up with a workable concept, where are we
                    going to get the money to pay for such a garden?” In the early stages we thought
                    it might be nice to supply a grove of dogwoods that would somehow provide the
                    annual good cross-Pacific feelings afforded by the cherry trees from Japan that
                    grace Washington's Tidal Basin. Preliminary research found that the best we
                    could possibly do would be to bring in small trees that had a slim chance of
                    surviving and certainly wouldn't, even under the best of circumstances, be
                    impressive until after many years.</p>
                <p>We were really stuck and befuddled until a prominent professor Khun Poonsaeng
                    knew came up with the brilliant suggestion that we consider supplying a
                    Buckminster Fuller style geodesic dome that would provide protective cover for a
                    U.S. Southwest cactus garden. We liked the idea, but realized it would be
                    extremely expensive and complicated to pull it off. Besides, we had no money for
                    such a project. So, under Ambassador Brown's authority and with his full
                    backing, we went to the American business community. We told them that America's
                    reputation was at stake, but that if they would work with us we could together
                    pull off a grand project that would be much appreciated by the Thais, including
                    the King and other members of the royal family. I was confident we could do it,
                    because I knew we could rely on two friends of mine, Malaysian architect Lim
                    Chong Keat and Thai architect Sumet Jumsai, who had been close to Buckminster
                    Fuller and knew quite a bit about the construction of geodesic domes. All we
                    really needed was the money to buy the material, to ship the pieces from the
                    U.S., and to pay for the design of the dome's interior. The Thai professor
                    assured us he would obtain the needed cactus plants.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>I proposed that we set up a special committee for the project, with the
                    Ambassador as honorary chairman, me as the executive secretary, and various
                    American Chamber, or AmCham, members filling the other positions, including
                    chairman. Given U.S. regulations, all direct fund-raising would have to be done
                    by AmCham or some other unofficial group. At my recommendation, the planners
                    decided not to accept any donations under $25,000. This was not to be a
                    hat-in-your-hand operation. And it would have been just too complicated to keep
                    track of and give proper credit to a wide range of funding sources. People
                    thought it was nutty to be turning our noses up at smaller donations, but then
                    the companies started to buy into that concept. Different companies signed up
                    one after the otheESSO, IBM, and so oand David Rockefeller said he would join if
                    we would set up at tax exempt foundation, which we did. Malcolm Forbes came in,
                    too. And then AmCham got Sealand to ship all the materials from the West Coast
                    for free. So we pulled in somewhere around $350,000 for the dome, and had it
                    constructed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How big was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: About three stories high.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it was a big one.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Oh, yes. And with a Buckminster Fuller dymaxian map on the ground, and
                    with nice cactus the Thais got from the U.S. and elsewhere, it looked pretty
                    greaand still does. Princess Sirinthorn, the so-called “Crown Princess” presided
                    over the opening, the King was briefed on it, and everybody thought it was just
                    the greatest thing. It ended up a win-win situation that made everybody
                    happy.</p>
                <p>So those were the two things we did to honor the King's birthday. They had a very
                    positive impact on the Thai leadership and general public, but neither one cost
                    USIS or the Embassy anything beyond the considerable staff time we put into
                    them.</p>
                <p>At the time of the Challenger disaster we did something similar to show unity of
                    spirit and purpose between Americans and Thais. Right after it blew up, Khun
                    Poonsaeng said to me, “You know, the Thai are very upset about this tragedy. We
                    identify with Americans on the space program, and many astronauts, including the
                    first ones back in the late '60s, have had high-profile visits to Bangkok over
                    the years. I think we should have some sort of a ceremony on the Embassy
                    property. I can get some people from the Royal Household and other prominent
                    contacts to come and participate.” She talked me into going forward with this
                    idea, and I persuaded Ambassador Brown to support it, though he was very
                    skeptical at first. So within a day or so we had set up a big stage, with large
                    pictures of the dead astronauts, and so on. And we held a very moving ceremony
                    right there on the Chancery grounds.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>Such public events, though perhaps inappropriate or even wasteful in other
                    contexts, were important at a time when our relationship with the Thais was in a
                    state of transition. Though our alliance continued with regular joint military
                    exercises such as Cobra Gold, we looked to the Thai to play host to VOA
                    transmitters, and many aspects of our former intimacy remained in place, we were
                    also pulling away from the Thais in other respects. With trade issues assuming
                    increasing importance, our once almost familiar relationship was being replaced
                    by one more cold-blooded and legalistic, so I thought it important to emphasize
                    the human dimension of our relations.</p>
                <p>My time as PAO in Bangkok was a period of high productivity, Pek and I enjoyed it
                    a lot, and our daughter Sarah was born there. I was glad to be turning the post
                    over to a consummate pro like Donna Oglesby, but I hated to leave
                    nonetheless.</p>

                <p>BLACKBURN: Yes, the four years were ovethough they had gone by in a flash. The
                    next thing I knew I was back in Washington as USIA Area Director for Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Explain to me how that happened.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Well, it was among the jobs I bid on when I was in my last year in
                    Bangkok.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they didn't have an Africa Area Director.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: I had been in Africa as an inspector, and had found the continent
                    fascinating. So I applied and was chosen. A good friend of mine, an Africa hand,
                    seeing my name on the assignments list, called me up and said, “What is going
                    on? That's MY job.” I said I didn't know, but had just applied for the job when
                    it was listed. He said, “You don't really want that job, do you? If you pull
                    out, I think they will give me the job.” I told him I didn't have any other
                    alternatives, so if Personnel chose me, I guess I should just go with it and do
                    my best. He was pretty unhappy, but later became an Ambassador. We are still
                    pals, so I think he has long since forgiven me for my “transgression.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was it like being in charge of an area you knew so
                        little about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Of course, when I took up the job many of the long-time Africa hands
                    thought I was a real interloper, never having served on the ground in the area.
                    Keenly aware of my ignorance, I was comforted by a conversation I had with Chas
                    Freeman, who I knew from his time as DCM in Bangkok and who was then the
                    Principle Deputy Assistant Secretary for Africa. Chas had never served in Africa
                    either. He said, “Don't worry about being a neophyte. Africa isn't like Asia.
                    Nearly everybody is a neophyte where Africa is concerned. It is such a diverse
                    and complicated place, practically nobody knows that much about the entire
                    continent. Aside from the few genuine FSO Africa experts, most of the supposed
                    Africa specialists generally know only about their part of the continent. Within
                    a couple of months on the job, you'll have as good a perspective on current
                    conditions as anybody, so don't worry about it.” Despite allowing for some
                    hyperbole in his comments, that was encouraging advicand turned out to be
                    largely quite accurate.</p>
                <p>I enjoyed the job very much. It was great to work with so many able and
                    enthusiastic junior officers at the overseas posts, most of whom were in need of
                    a fair amount of “mentoring” from those of us at USIA headquarters. And we had a
                    terrific team in the AF area office. Mike O'Brien, a super officer and long-time
                    Africa hand, was my deputy, and Sted Howard, the executive officer, handled with
                    tremendous skill the always complex and fragile administrative issues involved
                    in supporting the Africa posts. I also benefitted from working with Carolyn
                    Smith. She was the AF senior secretary and later served with me both in Tokyo
                    and on my last assignment back in the Department, in EAP/PD. The three of them,
                    and others, somehow kept me afloat during that year.</p>
                <p>Africa PAOs, I learned, need more than the usual assistance. Not only do they
                    face the hardships of living and working on the “Things Fall Apart” continent,
                    most are quite inexperienced. Though most were impressive officers with great
                    potential, many of them had trouble getting a handle on their local and
                    Washington resources, working effectively with their Ambassadors, and managing
                    other fundamental aspects of their programs. Despite their often uphill battles
                    of one kind or another, morale was very good. It was not at all unusual for
                    officers to seek to have their assignments extended. I think the FSOs there like
                    the direct contact with the audiences and the many chances to make a big
                    difference in the lives of the people they work with. But they needed, and still
                    need, an extra level of encouragement and support from headquarters.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>Knowing how difficult the Africa assignments can be, I made it a strict policy
                    never to seek a “forced assignment” to any of the posts. I was convinced it
                    would be counter-productive to do so. You've got to have enthusiasm to work well
                    in Africa. If you're not happy to be there, you will just be useless and your
                    tour will be a flop all around. I said I'd rather keep a post vacant than assign
                    the wrong person. Of course, Mike, Sted, and I were always on the lookout for
                    strong officers, and mostly thanks to the two of them, we came up with quite a
                    few during that year. Though in those days we could get away with being rather
                    picky about who we wanted and who we didn't want, I understand that it is much
                    harder to staff the posts these days, even though the pool of candidates now
                    includes the entire State Department ranks.</p>
                <p>I tried to travel as much as I could. During my year on the job, I got to 18 of
                    the 35 countries with USIS posts, and visited all those with more than one
                    officer. In addition, I held PAO conferences in Zambia and Senegal that put me
                    in direct touch with all the PAOs.</p>
                <p>The two dominant countries in Africa were, and still are, Nigeria and South
                    Africa, and our programs in those two countries consumed a lot of my time.
                    Nigeria was moving toward greater democracy, which opened up many opportunities
                    for new programming, while South Africa was in the final stages of apartheid. I
                    took special interest in South Africa, and visited there three times. I had been
                    deeply impressed by the USIS program I saw there as an inspector in 1976, when
                    the post had amazingly deep contacts among all the racial and ethnic groups of
                    that society and had just opened a USIS reading room in the “township” of Soweto
                    that was still in operation 13 years later when I became Area Director. In 1989
                    and 1990 Nelson Mandela was still in prison, but it was clear big changes were
                    coming. The post was working closely with the liberal universities, most of
                    which had adopted a “color-blind” policy on admissions and hirings. We came to
                    the conclusion that it was time to bring an end to the Fulbright program's
                    participation in the “educational boycott” of South Africa. I am proud that we
                    helped push along reinstitution of the program even in those years just before
                    the dramatic release of Mandela. That we could do so with such confidence was a
                    vivid demonstration of how much USIand the Embassy more generallwas on top of
                    the positive changes taking place in that country, changes we had significantly
                    supported over many years.</p>

                <p>BLACKBURN: The problem was to get people to actually go there in the first place.
                    Most officers were reluctant to serve in Africa, for whatever reasons, which
                    made our recruitment efforts difficult. We tried to emphasize the personal
                    satisfactions, as well as the professional recognition, they would get. To
                    spruce up our imagand self-imagI asked each of the posts to send in a piece of
                    contemporary art from their country, preferably a painting, print, or fabric we
                    could put on the office wall. I wanted visitors to be reminded that Africa is a
                    vibrant and interesting part of the world. We had had old-style African statues
                    of half-naked tribesmen, but I didn't think they presented the right picture.
                    The idea worked well, I thought. The more up-to-date art showed our officers
                    that once they got to the field they could make contact with exciting artists
                    working currently in Nigeria or Ethiopia or Gabon or wherever. It was all part
                    of our constant effort to recruit good officers.</p>

                <p>BLACKBURN: Bruce Gelb made the decision. He had taken over as Director about four
                    months previously, coming in with the first wave of Bush Administration
                    appointees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Somebody suggested you, I assume. Who was your
                        “interference?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: I don't know for sure. Probably it was Mike Pistor, then the Agency
                    Counselor, who got me on the short list of candidates. But Gelb had already seen
                    me in the context of my Africa work, so perhaps had been satisfied with my
                    performance there. And then I was interviewed by Bill Glade, the incoming
                    Associate Director, who had the final say. I must have made a decent impression
                    on him with my previous Fulbright experience, work with high school exchanges,
                    the New York Philharmonic concert in Bangkok, and the like.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And he was the guy who fired you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Yes, yes. We'll get to that.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>When I started in the E Bureau in 1989, it was just as the Iron Curtain was
                    falling. We were opening up to Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, and
                    there was enthusiasm for starting programs that would take advantage of the new
                    climate for interchange. I worked closely with Walt Raymond, a former CIA
                    officer who Bruce Gelb assigned to be the overall coordinator of all such
                    programs within USIA. In my new role I traveled to Russia for the Moscow Book
                    Fair, to Warsaw to explore how we might help greatly expand the post's small
                    library operation, and to Vienna, where I led a large gathering of USIA, USIS
                    post, and private sector professionals to discuss our common goals of expanding
                    exchanges with that region.</p>
                <p>As I was planning the latter event, I got a call late one afternoon from Bruce
                    Gelb, who, in an accusatory voice, asked why so many USIA people were being paid
                    to go off to Vienna for a conference that could be held in Washington for less
                    money. Fortunately, I was in the office at that late hour, fully on top of the
                    issue, and had the list of participants at my fingertips. I was able to justify
                    the event and each of the people we were sending. At the end of the conversation
                    he had calmed down and said, “Thanks, Paul. That's fine. You're doing a great
                    job.” It stands out in my memory perhaps because I didn't hear many such
                    compliments from him during my time in the E Bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of new programs did you work on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: For the Bush-Gorbachev summit meeting in Malta then NSC staffer
                    Condaleeza Rice apparently dreamed up the idecalled a “deliverable” in the
                    jargothat we should announce a new program of greatly expanded bilateral
                    exchanges. The goal was to send a thousand promising young people in each
                    direction each year. The initiative was not prominently featured in news
                    reports, but we in the E Bureau sure noticed it. We had had no advance notice,
                    but suspected that responsibility for operationalizing the pledge might soon
                    fall on our shoulders. We were quite anxious, because reaching those numbers
                    would take a lot of organizing and much more funding than we had available. So I
                    went over to the NSC to talk to Condi Rice and try to find out what was going
                    on. When she explained her deep desire for vastly increased bilateral exchanges
                    with Russia, I said we in USIA completely agreed with her but were concerned
                    about how the new venture would be funded. She said, “Don't worry. We'll get you
                    the necessary funding. But of course we have to get it started right away with
                    whatever can be funded using existing resources.” When I asked here if she had
                    any thoughts about how the exchanges should be organized, she answered, “No. I
                    leave it to you professionals to figure all that out.” So with those marching
                    orders and reassurances, such as they were, we got together and developed an
                    imaginative but also realistic scheme covering selection, administration, and
                    interim funding for this ambitious initiative. That was the sort of exciting
                    challenge we dealt with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did it come off?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Yes, it did. Of course, it couldn't all be done right away. The time
                    frame was spread out and various compromises made. I am not sure how long it
                    actually took for the numbers to add up to the target amount, but at least we
                    made a good shot at it right from the very beginning, even with no new money at
                    that stage. In subsequent years a great deal of funding was forthcoming under
                    the SEESupport for Eastern European Democracand other programs.</p>
                <p>Q: What else did you get involved in?</p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: One Quixotic effort that consumed a lot of my energy was to try to
                    rescue the USIA libraries, which were steadily losing priority within the
                    Agency. An old USIA pal of mine, Ken Wimmel, and I came up with the idea of
                    establishing a separate foundation to raise money for them. The approach would
                    be similar to fund-raising the Smithsonian has done to support its activities.
                    Ken and I brain-stormed a number of creative ideas for op-ed pieces in major
                    publications and direct appeals to the admittedly-limited cohort of people with
                    a strong financial or emotional stake in our overseas libraries or “information
                    centers.” We thought, for example, that perhaps the Polish-American community
                    might be interested in sponsoring a cultural center in Warsaw. We put on the
                    table various options about how it could be done, including some far-out
                    suggestions. It wasn't such a bad idea, but it sure didn't fly. Even in the
                    Agency, we learned, there weren't really that many people who cared much about
                    libraries. And when Ken and I presented the concept to Bill Glade, and then to
                    Gelb himself, neither found it an attractive concept given the amount of effort
                    it would take. So it just died then and there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were the E Bureau people to work with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: I was tremendously impressed by a number of the Civil Service
                    professionals I worked with on various projects. People like Dave Whitten, Judy
                    Siegal, Marianne Craven, Barry Ballou, Addie O'Connell, Bob Persiko, and Nan
                    Bell. Most of the FSOs, and several of the political appointees, were also
                    outstanding.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>But I found the job exceptionally difficult and stressful. I now realize that
                    most of the FSOs in that “number two” positioboth before and after mhave had
                    problemespecially the ones who were activists. The reason is structural, I
                    think. The incumbent of that position, though carrying a fancy title, is in fact
                    quite vulnerable whenever he or she tries to exert authority. You are deputy to
                    a political appointee who is working for another political appointee. And there
                    are other political appointeemore than 10 in my dawho are part of a network of
                    political relationships and hierarchies that operate outside the usual
                    bureaucracy we know. At the same time, you must exercise some authority over
                    senior and well-entrenched civil servants, some of whom are resistant to change
                    and know your tenure is likely to be a relatively brief one. And you have
                    Foreign Service people who likewise are working there only temporarily. No
                    matter how bright and committed they are, it takes them quite a while to get up
                    to speed, and often they don't have a clear idea of the internal Bureau dynamics
                    that can either facilitate or stymie their efforts. There you are, looking good
                    as the senior FSO in the operation, but you don't really have solid ground under
                    you.</p>
                <p>So the trouble I got into wasn't really something so out of the ordinary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But what was the issue that got you sacked a year into the
                        job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Why did I actually get fired? I was never given a real
                    explanation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You never were told?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: That's right. I never have known for sure.</p>
                <p>The way the firing was done happened like this: Going into the Agency my first
                    morning just back from my 1990 summer vacation, I ran into Mike Pistor in the
                    elevator. We chatted a bit, and he asked if he could stop by my office. About 15
                    minutes later he came into my office. He looked extremely glum and seemed
                    uncharacteristically inarticulate. I said, “Mike, you look awful. What's the
                    matter?” He said, “Actually, I do feel terrible.” I asked, “Does it have
                    anything to do with this conversation?” “Well, yessss,” he answered. So I of
                    course asked, “What is it Mike? Am I fired?” “Yes,” he replied, “As a matter of
                    fact, yes, you are.” He then told me I should arrange to be out the door within
                    two weeks.</p>
                <p>Mike couldn't give me a clear idea of why it was happening, though it was obvious
                    to both of us that I had irretrievably lost the confidence of the Agency's top
                    leadership. Bill Glade, who was my direct boss and might have been expected to
                    wield the ax himself, was extraordinarily solicitous of my bruised feelings,
                    even sending a note saying how much he admired how well I was handling what was
                    obviously a painful situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was Bill Glade, your boss, the man who fired
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Well, yes. He was ostensibly the man responsible for the firing, but I
                    think it was Gelb's decision, though no one was saying so. Before I left Bill
                    said he realized I might have some questions and in a month or so would take me
                    to lunch and explain what happened. Over our later meal at the Cosmos Club he
                    said the reason was that I had been opposed to one policy and had been
                    undermining implementation of another one. I said, “Bill, that doesn't really
                    make any sense. Those reasons don't reflect what I was actually doing, or even
                    thinking. Had we talked about those issues, I could easily have addressed your
                    concerns.” He said my response was enlightening, but of course I was still
                    fired.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is your best guess about the reason?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: I think Gelb at some point had come to the conclusion that I was not
                    adequately loyal to him. There was friction among some of the senior political
                    appointees in the Agency at that time, and I was perhaps seen as too close to
                    one or two people he did not trust. That is all speculation, but it forms the
                    backdrop for what I think really brought about my downfall.</p>
                <p>The Director got particularly angry about an IV program with the former Soviet
                    Union. In that period we were trying to bring over prominent Russian thinkers
                    from an intellectual class that included individuals known to be anti-Semitic.
                    The Embassy in Moscow came up with a slate of about ten intellectuals they
                    wanted to send under a special International Visitor program to be managed out
                    of USIA. The senior Foreign Service Officer in the IV office, Joel Levy, spotted
                    the sensitive aspects of the project and briefed me thoroughly. His office then
                    went back to our folks in Moscow and told them to carefully weed out any rabid
                    anti-Semites who might still be on their slate. The post did just that, and came
                    back with a strong cable defending their nominees, saying that they had dropped
                    two questionable candidates, and assuring us that Ambassador Jack Matlock, a
                    Russia specialist, had personally reviewed each nomination. When I heard that, I
                    told Joel that, with such a careful vetting, he should go ahead with the
                    program.</p>
                <p>But I had made a huge mistakthough one of process, not substance, as the actual
                    IV program was well conceived and went off smoothly. My mistake was not to have
                    briefed Bill Glade about what I was doing. He had been out of town while I was
                    talking with Joel, and I somehow neglected to tell him when he got back. So the
                    issue never got up to Gelb, who one day, out of the blue, was asked by friends
                    in New York why USIA was bringing Russian anti-Semites to the U.S. He was
                    furious when he realized that the project had not been fully cleared by senior
                    political people in the Agency.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Meaning himself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Sure. But he certainly felt that Gene Kopp or Bill Glade should have
                    been brought in on it. So I went to the woodshed. Gelb summoned me into his
                    office for an explanation, with Associate Director for Management Henry
                    Hokheimer asked to sit in on the conversation. He asked why I had so
                    presumptuously taken the responsibility on my own shoulders. I admitted I should
                    have briefed Bill Glade, but said I thought I was essentially following Agency
                    policy. Once the slate had been carefully reviewed, including by the Ambassador
                    himself, there was no reason not to go forward with the project. “The
                    Ambassador!” Gelb fumed, “What does he know about the political situation in the
                    United States?” I was being naive, I realize, but I did present the best defense
                    I could. Still, the Director had good reason to be upset. And he was very angry
                    indeed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're saying you didn't inform your superiors as well as
                        you should have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Right. In essence, that's it. Another Director might have written my
                    action off as a matter of questionable judgment or a slip-up of internal
                    communication, but Gelb saw it as much more serious than that. With him so
                    steamed and with the ongoing sniping he was hearing about me from some
                    quasi-political civil servants who did not appreciate actions I had taken, I
                    think my days were numbered from that point on.</p>
                <p>Getting fired was very painful, naturally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He didn't really fire you, did he? He just removed you
                        from your job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: That's true. I was never without a paycheck.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He didn't destroy your career, right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Well, it was almost the end of my career, but things didn't turn out
                    that way. This was 1990 and Personnel was on the verge of assigning me to be PAO
                    in Tokyo in 1992 following Rob Nevitt. At the time I was removed from the E
                    Bureau, Gelb was asked if I could be put on track to go to Tokyo two years
                    hence, and he adamantly said he would not sign off on any such assignment.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>At that point three extraordinary people came to my rescue and kept my career
                    alive for another 12 years. They were Deputy Director Gene Kopp, Counselor Mike
                    Pistor, and USIA Personnel chief Harlan Rosacker. Each of them had given me
                    strong support throughout my time in the E Bureau, but under these circumstances
                    they were simply marvelous. Mike knew that the Institute for the Study of
                    Diplomacy, or ISD, at Georgetown, under David Newsom, wanted to start regularly
                    having a senior officer from USIA as an ISD Fellow, a sort of diplomat in
                    residence. He put me directly in touch with Newsom, and the “parking” deal was
                    done. Gene Kopp gave me a terrific piece of advice. “Paul,” he said, “just keep
                    your head down for a while. Stay out of sight. Go over to Georgetown, try to
                    recruit some students, and generally do things helpful for America's public
                    diplomacy, to show that you are making a contribution to our Agency from over
                    there.” And Harlan Rosacker ran interference on the Japan assignment, putting
                    the job on hold and advising me on when best to resurface my bid for it. Since I
                    didn't need two years of Japanese, there was no urgent need to fill the Tokyo
                    slot, assuming it was going to go to me in the end. The rescue operation those
                    three carried out on my behalf was the neatest trick I ever heard of, even in
                    our relatively small Agency, where the saving of tottering careers was by no
                    means unheard of.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was it like at Georgetown?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: After leaving what had increasingly become a snake pit at the E
                    Bureau, I felt I was suddenly the proverbial “kid in a candy store.” At
                    Georgetown I found a tremendous range of interesting opportunities, and tried to
                    take advantage of as many as I could. I audited courseon subjects ranging from
                    “African Politics and the Novel” to “Japan's Political Economy” to one given by
                    Madeline Albright and Allan Goodman on “Emerging Trends in International
                    Relations” and participated in David Newsom's MA course on the conduct of
                    diplomacy.</p>
                <p>I put together my own graduate-level course on public diplomacy, building on
                    materials that Tom Tuch had developed when teaching the same subject earlier at
                    Georgetown, and got excellent advice from other sources, including Walter
                    Roberts, who was teaching public diplomacy at George Washington. I taught the
                    course both of the years I was at Georgetown, and had a great time with it. And
                    the comprehensive syllabus I developed contains materials I can still make use
                    of.</p>
                <p>Besides the course, I wrote a piece for The Washington Quarterly on “The
                    Post-Cold War Public Diplomacy of the United States.” I was just looking at it
                    the other day, and noted that even then I had emphasized the need for us to
                    overcome the chasm of mistrust and misunderstanding between the U.S. and the
                    Muslim world. The gulf was pretty evident, even to me, ten years ago, and of
                    course today is universally recognized.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>ISD had eight Fellows each year I was there, including people from the State
                    Department, CIA, USAID, and the foreign ministries of two other countries. I
                    organized us all in a series of monthly seminars, for faculty and students of
                    the School of Foreign Service, where we in turn held forth on our areas of
                    expertise or current research. In addition, I put together a big-league
                    symposium on “Southeast Asia in the 1990s.” For that, we just sent out
                    invitations to a selected mailing list, and about 150 people paid to come attend
                    the sessions. People from all over Washington turned up, including the legendary
                    Paul Nitze of SAIS, much to the delight of us all.</p>
                <p>Another conference I co-organized was on “Japan's Future Global Role.” It was for
                    a smaller, but very high quality audience. Professor Danny Unger (son of former
                    ambassador Leonard Unger) and I coedited an ISD-published book based on the
                    papers delivered at the symposium. Not allowed to take money for the book, I
                    accepted a “donation” from ISD of 200 complimentary copies, which I used as a
                    terrific presentation item with key contacts I met when I got to Japan. That all
                    worked out splendidly.</p>
                <p>And during the second year I focused a lot on Japaauditing courses, reading, and
                    studying Japanese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were still persuaded you had a good shot at going to
                        Japan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: At first it was on faith. But in the early part of my second year at
                    Georgetown and just before Bruce Gelb left the USIA directorship, someone from
                    my support group back in the Agency went back to him and said, “Look, Paul has
                    been over there at Georgetown and has been a fine representative of our Agency,
                    so could you sign off on him going to Tokyo?” And he agreed. So I didn't have to
                    wait out Bruce Gelb.</p>
                <p>Once the assignment was confirmed, the Agency paid for me to take remedial
                    Japanese at Diplomatic Language Services, just across the river from Georgetown
                    in Rosslyn. I could walk over Key Bridge each afternoon for two hours of study
                    at DLS, which was run by my old friend, John Ratliff. John had been the linguist
                    in charge of my Japanese studies at FSI Yokohama in 1971-1972. The Japanese came
                    back reasonably quickly during my one-on-one tutorials, so that became a
                    pleasant daily interlude.</p>
                <p>In fact, the whole Georgetown experience was quite splendid.</p>
                <p>PAO TOKY1992-96</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were refreshed and prepared to go back to
                        Japan.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Yes, I was. And again I had the rare good fortune to return to a post
                    where I had earlier served. To do so once was unusual enough, but to do it twice
                    was extremely rare. I never have heard of another case of it happening.</p>
                <p>Much to my amazement, the basics of the USIS Japan program to which I returned
                    were essentially unchanged from what they had been during the days of Alan
                    Carter and Barry Fulton. It still had a well-functioning DRS, a program
                    development office for speakers, a first-class press operation, and even
                    Carter-era FSOs back on hand to serve in key positions. My outstanding deputy,
                    Hugh Hara, was formerly BPAO Nagoya and fully steeped in the Carter/Fulton
                    systems approach. Veterans Bill Morgan and later under Emi Yamauchi made sure
                    that the Information Section hummed along at peak efficiency. And I was so
                    fortunate to have Japan guru Robin Berrington and later Art Zegelbone running
                    the Cultural Section. Another stand-out performer was Alex Almasov, who was a
                    most worthy successor to Warren Obluck, Robin Berrington, and me as Director of
                    the Tokyo American Center.</p>
                <p>Robin was ideally suited to working with Mike and Bonny Armacost. They were
                    deeply into the Tokyo cultural scene and liked to have frequent artsy receptions
                    at the Residence. That was something Robin loved and was so good at. Later, when
                    the Mondales arrived, Art was equally terrific in assisting Joan Mondale with
                    various cultural projects that were important to her and conveyed good cultural
                    messages.</p>
                <p>Though we had had a top-class operation in Japan, it was extremely costly, taking
                    up about half of the East Asia budget. Our FSNs earned an average of $100,000 a
                    year. At one point, because the exchange rate dropped below 90 yen to the
                    dollar, the senior USIS FSN, Mr. Konya, had a salary of some $230,000, which
                    made him the highest paid USG employee in our history! He was getting even more
                    than the President of the United States, who at the time got $200,000. We lost a
                    few positions along the way, had to close down one post, and terminated Trends
                    magazine, but basically did not suffer heavy cuts. The reason was that everyone
                    in Washington recognized that we had an extremely important mission to carry
                    ouin both the economic and security fields.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Mike Mansfield still involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: No. He was out of the picture once Armacost took over in 1989, well
                    before my return to Japan in 1992. I had about a year with Mike Armacost, and
                    then worked for the latter three years under Walter Mondale.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>But I will tell one Mansfield story. Before departing for Tokyo I saw Mansfield
                    at a reception and asked if I might stop by his office and get his views
                    regarding our public diplomacy effort in Japan. In his usual laconic and
                    to-the-point way he said, “No need for that. When you get to the post, just ask
                    Robin Berrington for his advice. He knows everything about what needs doing.”
                    Although I did indeed get plenty of counsel from Robin, I would have liked to
                    hear from the great man himself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what were the major specific issues you were dealing
                        with there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: This was still a time when many Americans feared that the Japanese
                    were going to overtake us economically and buy up our most treasured assets. The
                    revisionist “Japan as threat” thesis was in full flower. Its proponents held
                    that the “Japan Incorporated” web of private-government strategic
                    interconnection was not only directly harmful to the U.S., it was also spreading
                    threatening tentacles throughout the world, particularly in Asia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Setting up a new East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: That's right. And many in our country felt we Americans were not up to
                    this challenge, because we didn't have the access to the Japanese market we
                    needed. And the trade deficit kept getting bigger and bigger. So trade was a top
                    priority for my whole tour.</p>
                <p>Many of the economic issues were very technical and thus hard for USIS to deal
                    with, but we were effective in making the broad case for free trade and open
                    markets through our speakers, the IV program, and our publications. In addition,
                    the press office was in constant motion supporting the constant stream of U.S.
                    negotiators, Cabinet officials, CODELs, and other VIPs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you still have the branch posts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Yes. We had super teams of officers and FSNs at the American Centers
                    in Sapporo, Nagoya, Osaka, and Fukuoka.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Kyoto?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Kyoto, too, for part of the time. Unfortunately, I had to close it for
                    budgetary reasons. Having looked on Kyoto as the dream USIS posalong with
                    Florencfrom my earliest Foreign Service days, I particularly hated being the one
                    to preside over its demise.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought that would have been one of the last
                        of the branch posts to close.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Its cultural position was certainly important. Though we never had a
                    Consulate in Kyoto, the Embassy was always happy we kept a BPAO there. They
                    could send over the visiting firemen and know there was an FSO on the spot to
                    look after theto show them around, introduce them to important local personages,
                    and the like.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But perhaps the hard issues were not ones of concern in
                        Kyoto.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Right. Few of our DRS audiences were interested in our priority
                    issues, and they could be reached from Osaka, which is less than an hour away.
                    When closing Kyoto, we changed the name of our operation in Osaka to the Kansai
                    American Centeto emphasize that we would continue to give a high degree of
                    program attention to key contacts in Kyoto. Though our friends in Kyoto were
                    very unhappy to see us pull out and I wish we could have kept the post open, I
                    understand the new arrangement is working pretty well. Shortly before I left
                    Japan, we also came close to shutting down Sapporo, and after I left, they
                    actually did so.</p>
                <p>A bigger issue was whether or not to have a branch operation in Naha, Okinawa.
                    Though it was out of the question to set up a full-fledged American Center
                    there, over the years the Consuls and senior Embassy officers like DCMs Bill
                    Breer and Rusty Deming had encouraged USIS to assign an FSO and some FSNs yo
                    Naha. I strongly, and successfully, resisted the proposition, but Louise Crane,
                    my successor, had a different take and transferred one of the Cultural Section
                    FSO positions down there. My argument, based in part on whatever authority I
                    could derive from having spent two summers in Naha in my college days, was that
                    there was little for a BPAO to do except work as a kind of glorified assistant
                    to the Consul. The audiences for discussion of bilateral issues were extremely
                    smalexcept when it came to the “100-pound gorilla,” that is, our bases on the
                    island. For the latter issue, there were already the officers in the Consulate
                    and the vast military public affairs apparatus.</p>
                <p>I said we would send Press Office personnel down on TDY whenever needed. AIO John
                    Lundin was especially effective handling such TDYs. I also pointed out that
                    despite all the IV grants lavished over the years on the two Okinawan dailies,
                    those newspapers never cut us any slack at all on bases issues. If anyone could
                    have any influence on their editorial and news treatment policies, it would only
                    be the Consul or the military brass. Besides, I argued, the Consul's job is more
                    than 50% public affairs anyway, so we should be concentrating on giving public
                    diplomacy training to the Consul and his or her FSN stafor perhaps assign a USIS
                    officer as Consul. Even after the consolidation of USIA and the State
                    Department, the Department still hasn't taken up either suggestion. Anyway,
                    those were my arguments, and they prevailed for a time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the Fulbright program in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: The Fulbright program occupied a lot of my time, just as it did Rob
                    Nevitt and most of my predecessors. A senior Japanese Foreign Ministry official
                    and I (as the Ambassador's representative) annually rotated the positions of
                    Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the bi-national commission, formally known as the
                    Japan-United States Commission for Educational Exchange (or JUSEC).</p>
                <p>JUSEC is one of the very best, most active Fulbright operations in the world. The
                    extraordinary Caroline Yang, who became its Executive Director early in the
                    1970s, was still there. After leaving the job she became a member of the J.
                    William Fulbright Board of Foreign Scholarships, and now is its Chair. She was
                    replaced by Sam Shepherd, a top-notch exchanges professional in the field who we
                    selected after an exhaustive open competitioand after successfully fending off
                    Japanese arguments that the job should be reserved for Foreign Ministry
                    retirees.</p>
                <p>The Fulbright program in Japan is generously supported by its Japanese alumni.
                    Many of them came to the U.S. after the war, got advanced degrees, and then
                    returned to Japan to make a lot of money. These alums made a substantial
                    contribution, as much as a million dollars each year, and I enjoyed getting to
                    know theand to thank them for all they had done and were doing to support the
                    program.</p>
                <p>The alumni put on an annual golf tournament, which was a big money-making and
                    social occasion. However, unlike for avid golfers like Mike Armacost, Rob
                    Nevitt, and Caroline Yang, for me it was something of an annual embarrassment,
                    because I don't play golat least don't play it with skill and enthusiasm. The
                    event was held it at the Totsuka Country Club, and each participant paid a $700
                    fee. The money covered not only the golf game, but also the chance to win one or
                    more of the terrific donated itemwhich sometimes included a car and always
                    several international plane tickets. They would raise well over $100,000 from
                    the 150 or so people who attended. I didn't actually have to pay the $700 fee,
                    as one of the more affluent alums would cover expenses for the Japanese and
                    American chairmen, as well as the Executive Director.</p>
                <p>So I would go and play, and be a good sporand actually have a lot of fun, too.
                    One year I won the “booby prize,” a very large stuffed animal I gave my young
                    daughter. The Japanese are very smart about these things, and award this prize
                    not to the person who registers the lowest score, but insteaknowing some people
                    might purposely play badly in order to be the worst golfegive it to the player
                    with the second to worst score. That was me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Didn't your tenure there overlap the 50th anniversary of
                        the end of the war?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>BLACKBURN: It sure did. We spent a lot of time thinking about how best to posture
                    ourselves for 50-year anniversaries of such 1945 events as the fire bombing of
                    Tokyo, the Battle of Iwo Jima, the Battle of Okinawa, the atomic bombing of
                    Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the formal end of the war.</p>
                <p>I was particularly concerned that we help the “main island Japanese” better
                    understand what really happened during the Battle of Okinawa and how the
                    horrific fighting there figured so centrally in the American decision to drop
                    the atomic bombs. The Governor of Okinawa at that time, Governor Ota, was
                    considered by many in the Embassy to be very anti-American. He had received a
                    Ph.D. in the United States, had written a history of the Battle of Okinawa, and
                    was very opposed to our bases. Having been on Okinawa in the 1950s, when
                    memories of the devastating battle were still raw for the Okinawans, I
                    recommended that we pay respectful attention to Governor Ota during whatever
                    commemoration the Okinawans thought appropriate for marking the awful tragedy.
                    Following the advice of many of the old Japan hands, Ambassador Mondale and the
                    top U.S. military brass did just that, I am happy to say. The Okinawans put on a
                    very moving ceremony, and inaugurated a unique peace park that lists the names
                    of all those killed in the battle: Japanese, Okinawans, Americans, Koreans, and
                    Chinese.</p>
                <p>To help get us past the August 1995 Hiroshima anniversary, I encouraged
                    Ambassador Mondale to visit that city in 1993 or 1994 and give a speech to the
                    chamber of commerce, as previous Ambassadors had done. Though the speech would
                    primarily deal with commercial matters, we could expect that in the Q&amp;A
                    period he would get a question on the A-bombing. I hoped he would have a chance
                    to say something to the effect that though most Americans had supported that
                    action as a way to bring the war to a decisive conclusion, we who are alive a
                    half century later must look to the future and do everything possible to ensure
                    that nuclear weapons are not used again in the coming fifty years. Words to that
                    effect, anyway. The idea was to get an on-the-record statement that we could
                    refer back to when asked for comments during the actual anniversary period. In
                    the event, the Ambassador never did get to Hiroshima during those years.</p>
                <p>At one point, I also favored recommending to the White House that President
                    Clinton include a brief stop in Hiroshima during his 1993 visit to Japan.
                    Despite my argument that such a visit would be a statesmanlike gesture and
                    perhaps help defuse anti-American sentiment when the actual anniversary came
                    along, others in the Embassy adamantly insisted it would be much too risky, so
                    the idea never went forward. Despite my failed efforts to forestall public
                    affairs problems, the Hiroshima and Nagasaki anniversaries came and went without
                    a great deal of the agonizing I had anticipated.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>I also got into the middle of the Air and Space Museum's ambitious plan for an
                    exhibition around the plane that dropped the bomb on Hiroshima, the Enola Gay,
                    which ultimately produced a big controversy and much embarrassment for the
                    Smithsonian. The museum proposed to display part of the aircraft and supplement
                    it with a four-part exhibit highlighting the evolution of the war up to
                    mid-1945; the testing and preparations for using the bomb; the actual delivery
                    details of getting it from Tinian Island to its target; and the on-the-ground
                    devastation. This multi-sided concept represented a major departure from the
                    usual celebratory exhibitions at the museum. When the curator, Tom Crouch, and
                    others came to the Embassy, I was the point person to talk with them. I told
                    them that as far as the Embassy was concerned, the Air and Space Museum could
                    make its own decisions, but that I personally applauded the idea of educating
                    the American people about this important part of our history. I also suggested
                    culturally-sensitive ways for them to approach the Japanese and elicit
                    cooperation while maintaining control of the content in the most problematical
                    fourth segment of the exhibit. The Japanese involvement was essentially worked
                    out to everyone's satisfaction, but the curators faced insurmountable “cultural”
                    problems in dealing with the U.S. Air Force veterans! They unleashed a storm of
                    criticism against the entire concept. The veterans didn't want anything in the
                    exhibition about devastation and suffering on the grounor about the evolution of
                    the war, either. Essentially, they wanted the exhibition confined to technical
                    aspects of its second and third themes: the development and delivery of the bomb
                    by the Enola Gay. The whole scheme fell apart and became a first-class fiasco,
                    one that cost the director his job. The museum finally mounted a very modest
                    display, but without most of the contextual material originally planned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like the military relationship was very high on
                        the Embassy's agenda in those days.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Our concerns never seemed to have a moment's rest. In the fall of
                    1995, just after the U.S. had, with the help of the Japanese, avoided most of
                    the pitfalls surrounding the various 50th anniversaries, we were jolted by the
                    news of a horrible gang rape of a young Okinawan girl. Many of us feared that
                    that dramatic, horrifying event might well become the catalyst for our being
                    forced out of some or even all of our bases in Japan.</p>
                <p>USIS closely monitored the Japanese mood, in the media and elsewhere, which
                    suddenly became quite critical of the U.S., especially our continuing to have
                    bases in Japan. Over the months of the crisis, I reported on Japanese opinion at
                    a number of meetings with senior U.S. commanders in Japan (including General
                    Richard Myers and General Pete Pace, currently the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of
                    the Joint Chiefs of Staff) as well as with senior visiting Defense Department
                    officials such as Secretary William Perry (who had seen devastated Okinawa at
                    the end of the war) and Joseph Nye. The DOD leadership, and senior military
                    officers on the scene, deeply concerned about protecting the Okinawa bases, made
                    sensitive expressions of remorse and apology, and worked with State Department
                    counterparts to fashion policies to reduce our “footprint” on that island.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>Meeting over lunch with a group of contacts who were senior editors at the major
                    dailies, I learned that early in the crisis they had met among themselves to
                    discuss what could be done about the growing mood of anti-Americanisnot only on
                    Okinawa but throughout the country. They recognized that Americans were
                    observing this trend and beginning to conclude that the Japanese public wanted
                    the U.S. to remove the bases right away. Believing that such a withdrawal would
                    be very harmful to Japan's interests, particularly at a time when the Chinese
                    were conducting intimidating missile tests in the Taiwan Straits, they decidein
                    Japanese consensus fashioto calm down the reporting by their correspondents and
                    use their editorials to support continuance of the bilateral security
                    relationship. Once those policies were implemented by the Japanese mass media
                    leaders, public opinion rather quickly returned to where it had been. In the
                    four main islands, that is, though not on Okinawa itself. I think that gives a
                    good example of how “Japan Incorporated” sometimes operated in the U.S.
                    interest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Japanese ever get to try the rapists? Or were they
                        tried in an American court?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: The Japanese eventually tried them, though I don't know exactly what
                    happened. As a result of this awful case, we agreed to changes in the SOFA, or
                    Status of Forces Agreement, that made it easier for the Japanese to indict our
                    soldiers in such instances. One of the reasons the Japanese had been so upset
                    with us over this incident was that our military had let the alleged perpetrator
                    of a previous rape slip out of Okinawa and get back to the U.S. before anyone
                    could nab him. Understandably, they were highly suspicious that such a thing
                    might again happen in this case.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have speaker programs on security issues as

                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Yes, we had many, both by non-governmental and USG specialists. One
                    innovation I made was to introduce a new regional forum for addressing issues
                    related to the U.S. security presence in Asia. I dubbed it SNEAS, or the
                    Symposium on Northeast Asian Security. It was designed to bring American experts
                    together with Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Russian, and Mongolian security
                    specialist alums of USIA and CINCPAC's long-standing Symposium on East Asian
                    Security, or SEAS. With participation by Ambassador Mondale, Assistant Secretary
                    Winston Lord, anvia digital videoconferencinCINCPAC Joseph Prueher, later my
                    Ambassador in Beijinwe held the kick-off SNEAS conference in Tokyo in 1996. It
                    was cosponsored by the Japan Institute for International Affairs. The next year
                    SNEAS was mounted in Seoul, I brought it to Beijing in 2000, and later it went
                    to Ulan Bator and back to Tokyo. I don't know if it is still going on, but
                    during those years I felt it made a valuable contribution to our broader
                    security effort.</p>

                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Working for Walter Mondale was always interesting. Mondale of course
                    is one of the great American politicians of our era...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By what measure?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: In my view he represents the highest standards of integrity and public
                    service. Besides that, I found him to be good-hearted and on the right side of
                    issues that I care about. The Japanese were delighted to have him there as our
                    Ambassador. They love to have us send them an “oo-mono” meaning a person of
                    great prestige as well as substance, someone with the ear of the President, like
                    a Mansfield, Tom Foley, or Howard Baker.</p>
                <p>Mondale made an excellent public impression. He particularly enjoyed talking to
                    bright and powerful younger people, the second echelon power structure, if you
                    will. He wanted to get things done, while minimizing long discussions and formal
                    exchanges of platitudes that are so much a part of meetings with older
                    Japanese.</p>
                <p>Joan Mondale was enthusiastic about being in Japan. She always seemed to be
                    having a great time, was ever on the go, and made friends easily. Known during
                    her Washington years as “Joan of Art,” she had an activist agenda for promoting
                    closer cultural ties between the U.S. and Japan. Her pet project was promoting
                    U.S.-style “public art” in Japan, and in collaboration with CAO Art Zegelbone
                    developed an interesting talk on the subject that she presented at numerous
                    venues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Mondale go out and talk to students, on the campuses
                        and elsewhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Only to some extent. But when he did, he was terrific. He also had a
                    wonderful touch with the media, and was readily available to correspondents,
                    especially American ones, with whom he held background sessions from time to
                    time.</p>
                <p>While many of Mondale's press activities were suggested by us in USIS, he would
                    sometimes initiate them on his own. For example, when a Japanese student was
                    murdered in New Orleans, he was so disturbed by it he told us to set up an
                    impromptu event that morning where he could express his apologies and sorrow. He
                    also wanted to explain that Americdespite the horror stories one hearreally is
                    essentially a safe and welcoming country. That personal gesture was something
                    only a big-league American representative could have carried off. It got
                    excellent media play and helped defuse the sense of outrage surrounding the
                    crime.</p>
                <p>Mondale had no complaints about Bill Morgan as his Press Attache, but he felt
                    frustrated not having a personal press assistant on his immediate staff.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How come you didn't give him one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: He really wanted something we couldn't provide. In Bill and then Emi
                    Yamauchi, the Embassy was served by top-of-the-line Information Officers/Embassy
                    spokespersons. In fact, Bill Morgan had ratcheted up the Press Office operation
                    to meet Mondale's need for early information on the Japanese press by
                    instituting a daily four- or five-page “Quick Read.” That document took a lot of
                    Japanese FSN and American time in the early hours, but was available at the
                    opening of business. It was a terrific product and much appreciated by the
                    Ambassador - and everyone else in the Embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But that wasn't enough? Is that what you are saying?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Yes. He wanted someone, he told me, who would function like one of the
                    staffers he had had when he was Senator and Vice President. Some enthusiastic
                    young person who loved to go out in the evening and socialize with reporters,
                    who would pick up the gossip, and who could at times drop a hint or give out a
                    little something that might produce a favorable item in the press. He was mostly
                    thinking of American correspondents, not Japanese ones, of course. He said he
                    had no criticism of USIS, but wanted to supplement its outreach to the media by
                    means of someone more directly focused on his day-to-day interests. Realizing
                    that we did not have anyone to assign to him on that basis, Mondale went to USIA
                    Director Joe Duffey and asked for the allocation of a Schedule C political slot.
                    In the end Duffey found the position, and Andy Meyers, who was resident in Tokyo
                    and had previously done some advance work for the White House, was hired to do
                    the jothough several non-USIS people in the Embassy tried in vain to talk
                    Mondale out of the idea.</p>
                <p>Anyway, Andy was brought in and we all made the best of what was an awkward
                    situation. The fact that Andy didn't know the local or international media or
                    have any resources to contribute to his interactions with theother than their
                    knowledge that he was on the Ambassador's personal stafmeant that he depended
                    heavily on the USIS Information Office, which continued as before to carry out
                    the mainstream media relations program of the Embassy. Though Bill Morgan
                    handled the situation with outward aplomb, I felt I had let his operation down
                    by not successfully heading off Andy's assignment. After a month or two of
                    breaking in, the arrangement sorted itself out. Andy proved pretty easy to work
                    with, and used his advance-man skills to arrange some good public affairs
                    events, such as an Ambassadorial visit to a Japanese super market selling
                    American products. It wasn't a great situation, as I think the Ambassador
                    probably soon realized, but Andy and USIS cooperated to make it work as well as
                    possible.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any Presidential visits during that era?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Yes, there were two visits by President Clinton, beginning with the
                    1993 G-8 meeting in Tokyo. It was Clinton's first overseas trip as President and
                    included a strong speech on regional security issues at Waseda University, an
                    event we helped shape and carry off. The White House press advance people, led
                    by the meticulously-professional Anne Edwards, were in a state of high anxiety,
                    which made us even more anxious than usual to get everything right. I asked for
                    and got a “dream team” of carefully-selected USIA officers assigned on TDY from
                    all over the world. We laid on a great support operation, for which we received
                    many kudos - despite the fact that on the way into town from the airport the
                    press bus I was traveling on with Anne Edwards got into an accident right on the
                    Shuto Expressway (with a police escort, yet). Working in the trenches with Anne
                    on two POTUS visits laid a good basis for our collaboration on the much more
                    complicated and even more high-profile Clinton visit to China in 1998.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What else did you focus on while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Working with ACAO Anne Callaghan, an immensely talented Japanese
                    speaking officer, I spent a great deal of time trying to supporor rescuAmerican
                    branch campuses that had been set up by U.S. universities in collaboration with
                    Japanese institutions during the heady “bubble” period around 1990. Both the
                    Americans and their Japanese business/academic partners had unwisely thought
                    these operations would make a lot of money. At the peak there were about 30 such
                    ventures all over the country, but the flawed dreams of the educational
                    entrepreneurs who set them up quickly went up in smoke. Besides the effects of
                    the economic downturn, the collaborations suffered from destructive cultural
                    clashes between the Japanese and American partners. Ultimately, none of them
                    were profitable, some folded even before they got started, and only the
                    already-functioning Temple University branch survives to this day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were these for American students or Japanese
                        students?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Mostly they were intended for Japanese students, though Americans
                    resident in Japan or on overseas study programs could also attend. The hope was
                    that many Japanese would take courses for one or two years at the branch campus,
                    and then go on to the U.S. for further study. The prospect of large numbers of
                    fully funded Japanese students was of course enormously attractive to the
                    American colleges and universities.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>When things began to get difficult, the organizers of these programs looked to us
                    in the Embassy for help. For instance, they wanted us to lean on the Japanese
                    Ministry of Education to afford the branch campuses some kind of formal
                    recognition. Such status would help them with everything from recruitment to
                    student rail passes. The Ministry, a particularly conservative institution, was
                    not inclined to bend over backwards for these not-yet established branches,
                    especially since they showed at best a minimal willingness to follow the
                    regulations applied to Japanese colleges and universities.</p>
                <p>I also tried to help American academics teaching at Japanese universities who
                    claimed (often with justification) that they were victims of Japanese prejudice
                    against foreigners. On several occasions they had a chance to voice their
                    concerns directly to Ambassador Mondale, and with my help he spoke to Japanese
                    officials on their behalf.</p>
                <p>We gave good advice to the struggling campuses and helped the professors as much
                    as we could, but were less effective in moving the Japanese bureaucracy than or
                    thewould have liked. One activity that did bring me satisfaction was my
                    involvement in what we called “the Oiso group.” It consisted of ten top American
                    and Japanese professionals in cultural and educational exchanges between the two
                    countries. Some participants were from foundation world, while others - like a
                    Japanese Foreign Ministry official and were governmental. We produced a report
                    that took direct aim at some of the fundamental Japanese practices and
                    regulations that impeded the growth of international interchange. Our practical
                    suggestions, and the clear way they were presented, helped form the basis for
                    ground-breaking legislation promoting the growth of NGOs. However, caught
                    completely by surprise by the report, my up-tight Foreign Ministry counterpart
                    on the Fulbright commission was angry that I had been involved in a project that
                    implicitly criticized the Japanese government, especially having done so in
                    league with onor perhaps morof his bureaucratic enemies. He called in DCM Rusty
                    Deming to formally complain about my “inappropriate and undiplomatic” actions.
                    Rusty was unfazed by the criticism, agreeing with me that the influential report
                    never could have been done if it had been subject to an internal Japanese
                    clearance process.</p>
                <p>CHINA ASSIGNMENT AND LANGUAGE TRAININ1996-97</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went off to China. How did it happen that you
                        were assigned there? I don't remember that you had any particular background
                        in China.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>BLACKBURN: True, I didn't have much, except for my graduate study, my Legislative
                    Reference Service work, and my support for the 1979 Mondale visit. Getting that
                    assignment was a total surprise. Here is how it happened. One day in the spring
                    of 1995 I noticed in my email take a message in transliterated Thai, of all
                    things. When I had deciphered it, I realized it was from my old friend Harlan
                    Rosacker, Director of USIA Personnel, asking if I would be interested in going
                    to Beijing as PAO. He said I should not mention the communication to anyone
                    except my wife, but to call him if I wanted to discuss the idea.</p>
                <p>After consulting with Pek, I called and asked what in the world was going on.
                    Harlan said, “The senior assignments inner circle grouincluding Director Duffey,
                    Counselor Donna Oglesby, and mthink that you are the Agency's most-qualified
                    person to be running USIS in China at this point. We have two strong candidates
                    among the China hands, but neither has had your large-post management
                    experience. So how about it?” They wanted me to curtail in Tokyo and start
                    language training that summer, arriving at post in the summer of 1997. I said
                    I'd be delighted to have the job, but there was no way I could leave Tokyo
                    before the end of my tour in 1996. Harlan said in that case I would just have a
                    year of language training and do the best I could with that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean, studying on the side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: No, it was to be a full-time year starting in 1996. But not the usual
                    two years. Harlan said they would give me all possible support, but did not
                    expect me to reach the S-3, R-3 proficiency normally required for assignment to
                    the position.</p>
                <p>I was told that secrecy was necessary so that everything could be worked out more
                    smoothly. Well, this was extremely awkward for me, because it meant that my
                    boss, East Asia Area Director George Beasley, was not in the loop. George was
                    not just my boss, but also the officer I was to replace in Beijing in 1997.
                    Besides that, he was the former head of the Chinese Language School in Taijung
                    and a strong believer in sending people to China with the strongest possible
                    language skills.</p>
                <p>So USIA directly contacted Stapleton Roy, the Ambassador in Beijing, to seek his
                    concurrence in the assignment. Stape had known me since he was DCM in Bangkok,
                    when I was PAO and Frank Scotton, now the Beijing PAO, was CAO. He of course
                    consulted Frank, who was taken aback by the news and immediately contacted
                    George Beasley. This backwards way of getting the word to George was very
                    unfortunate in many respects. Among them was that it put me in a bad light. It
                    looked like I had at best been complicit in a deception and at worst had perhaps
                    instigated the whole thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>Stape Roy was willing to concur, provided that I came equipped with a 3-3, or
                    close to it, in Chinese. Frank told him that if anyone could reach that level in
                    just a year, he was confident I would at least make a good stab at it. I gather
                    Stape okayed the assignment on the basis of that rather vague assurance.</p>
                <p>I fully respected the strong views of George, Stape, Frank, and the other leading
                    China-hand candidates for the job. No wonder they had reservations about me.
                    Here I was coming along out of the blue, at 57, not knowing a word of Chinese.
                    Such an age is definitely not the recommended time in one's life to start
                    learning that endlessly complex language!</p>
                <p>Anyway, I had the assignment and was determined to make the best of it. From 1995
                    until I left Tokyo in 1996 a Chinese-speaking wife of an officer on the Embassy
                    compound taught me some basics of the language for a couple of hours a week.
                    Once I got to FSI in Washington and was tested, the linguist determined that
                    those introductory lessons were enough to get me placed in that semester's only
                    available new class above the beginner level. I joined two other officers, Robin
                    Bordie and Doug Kelly, who had previously lived in China, already spoke quite a
                    bit of Chinese, and clearly were way ahead of me.</p>
                <p>Robin and Doug showed enormous tolerance of my presence in the class, and I owe
                    them an awful lot. I got a tremendous pusand pulfrom being in class with them,
                    while struggling to move along at their pace. That year of Chinese was, by a
                    long way, the hardest of my Foreign Service career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can imagine.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: For those ten months I was totally consumed with trying to learn
                    Chinese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does your wife, Pek, speak Chinese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>A: Yes, some. And that helped provide a supportive atmosphere at home. I also got
                    a boost from Pek's aunt, who was with us at the time and speaks pretty fluent
                    Mandarin. She helped me with drills and in other ways.</p>
                <p>As a way of keeping sane and not taking myself too seriouslI would say to myself,
                    “Look. When it comes to the Chinese language, you are nothing but a
                    fuzzy-headed, pudgy, and naked old man with a speech impediment. But come ohow
                    bad is that?” My attitude was simply to give the challenge my all-out best
                    effort. And the teachers were terrifically supportive. After a year, thanks to
                    the instructors, to my fellow students, to my own efforts, and to the leg up I
                    got from previous exposure to Thai tones and grammar as well as to Japanese
                    characters, I finished the ten months having reached an S-2+, R-3.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>After that I went to Taiwan for ten more weeks of study and further progress at
                    the Taipei Language Institute. Once I got to Beijing and started working in the
                    language, I continued to improve and eventually reached my cherished goal of the
                    S-3, R-3. I thought that was quite an accomplishment, one that paid a kind of
                    debt I owed to George, Frank, and the others who rightly upheld the importance
                    of Chinese language competence for all officers assigned to China.</p>
                <p>PAO BEIJIN1997-2000</p>
                <p>Once on the ground at the post, I got great satisfaction from using the language
                    whenever I could, with strong encouragement from Chinese I dealt with. I had
                    many chances to speak Chinese in meetings, when making toasts, and in other
                    semi-formal situations. My excellent Chinese language tutor helped me with
                    remarks I made at functions. Some of those presentations were considered so
                    amusing and apt that they were later included in the standard teaching materials
                    used for advanced Chinese language studies by FSOs in Beijing.</p>
                <p>Working in China was tremendously stimulating. The energy and excitement of the
                    place were palpable. Though it retains many of the unpleasant characteristics of
                    a totalitarian dictatorship, the country is changing so fast and in so many ways
                    that its future directions are one of the great stories of our age, a fact that
                    accounts for the presence of legions of foreign correspondents there. Every day
                    I would wake up expectinand unusually findinsome mind-blowing and major change
                    occurring right under my nose.</p>
                <p>I had the chance to travel all over China. We had branch posts, known after
                    “consolidation” as the Public Affairs Sections, or PAS, of the local consulates,
                    in Shanghai, Shenyang, Chengdu, and Guangzhou. I got to all of them several
                    times and to many other parts of the country as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How big a staff did you have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: We had 18 Americans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're kidding! I didn't realize we had that many people
                        in China.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Yes, it was a substantial number. For example, we had an IO and two
                    AIOs, plus three ACAOs reporting to the CAO, and five officers at the
                    branches.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did they all do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Well, for example, you needed an ACAO just to run the International
                    Visitor program. China had, and still has, the largest IV program in the world,
                    sending well over 100 people as either IVs or Voluntary Visitors. It was an
                    enormous undertaking. And the Fulbright program had to be handled by an ACAO in
                    our office, because there is no Fulbright binational commission in China. We
                    needed an ACAO to work exclusively on handling a program that in terms of
                    numbers of exchangees almost equaled Japan's, which is run by the Japan-United
                    States Exchange Commission under an Executive Director and more than 20 Japanese
                    employees. And you needed a third ACAO for the speaker program, which involved
                    an array of lectures and seminars throughout China. Then we had a Regional
                    Library Officer, who was responsible for all the Information Resource Centers in
                    China, as well as strengthening our contacts in the Chinese library world.</p>
                <p>On the information side, we needed an AIO for press and an AIO for electronic
                    media as well as the Embassy website. In addition, we had a contract American
                    editor of the post-produced Chinese language magazine called Jiaoliu, which we
                    sent out each quarter to a selected mailing list of about 10,000. And we had an
                    Executive Officer, until consolidation, and a computer specialist, both of whom
                    were sorely needed to keep us afloat in that country.</p>
                <p>All the branches were one-officer posts, except Shanghai, which had two.</p>
                <p>In our front office, I had a deputy, Don Bishop, and an American secretary, first
                    Maxine Jeffries and then Linda Adams.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Chinese staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: There were about 55 Chinese staffers at all our various facilities.
                    They were officially employed by the Diplomatic Services Bureau, or DSB, and
                    could be removed by them at any time. Though this had happened quite frequently
                    in earlier years, by the time I got there we were essentially able to hold on to
                    the ones we wanted to keep. There were pluses and minuses to the fact that they
                    were not Foreign Service Nationals. On the plus side, it was easy to discharge
                    them, an option I had to exercise a couple of times. They were entitled to two
                    week's notice, but in both cases I delivered the news on a Friday afternoon and
                    they chose to depart immediately. On the minus side, we were constrained by DSB
                    regulations that made it difficult to reward the outstanding performers, as the
                    DSB took a handsome cut of all payments.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>I was pleasantly surprised at how good and loyal the Chinese staff was, having
                    over the years heard accounts of their inefficiency and unreliability. That was
                    not my experience at all. And we were getting better employees all the time,
                    thanks mainly to having more control over the hiring process. Even some of the
                    old-timers, like Yang Gengqi, in charge of distribution, were first-rate, while
                    new hires like Gu Hong in the Information Resource Center and Lin Chunmei in the
                    Press Section were fully the equal of FSN counterparts in other countries where
                    I servein terms of dedication, analytical ability, English fluency, and overall
                    professional skills.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Americans you programmed fare under the rigid
                        Chinese system?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: There were certainly rigidities, but just as with our experience with
                    managing DSB employees, we found more and more flexibility. For example, by the
                    time I arrived we had growing input into what campuses the some 20 American
                    Lecturers brought over each year under the Fulbright program would be assigned
                    to. We even “sanctioned” one leading university by denying it a lecturer because
                    of our unhappiness with the way they had treated an American professor the
                    previous year. The university quickly shaped up, allowing us to resume
                    placements to that institution. Except for rare instances, the American
                    Fulbrighters were extremely enthusiastic about their China experiencethe
                    students they taught, the seminars they arranged or participated in, and their
                    opportunities for travel all over the country. Although it was a constant
                    struggle to recruit Fulbrighters to go to China, once there on the ground, they
                    were amazed and delighted with what they found.</p>
                <p>At this time all of us in the Embassy were witnessing, even participating in,
                    major changes in China. To the astonishment of many, for example, my wife was
                    invited to give numerous guest lectures at both the Foreign Affairs College and
                    Peking University, two institutions once very difficult for Embassy officers or
                    their families to visit without special permission. In USIS we pushed the
                    envelope in many ways. For instance, with “rule of law” being a priority of the
                    Chinese leadership, our post, our speakers, and Fulbright Lecturers organized
                    conferences on such topics as American legal education in America and the
                    relationship of law and the media.</p>
                <p>Some of our speakers dealt with more provocative topics. For example, Joshua
                    Muravchik spoke all over the country about America's commitment to democracy. He
                    is a conservative intellectual, often published in the Washington Times, and a
                    powerful, though soft-spoken, lecturer. His straight-forward message to
                    audiences was that America will not feel truly secure in this world until all
                    major countries, especially including China, are democracies. It was the kind of
                    message that you would think could not be delivered to audiences in China,
                    buhandled properlit could be done.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>Similarly, we had speakers address the sensitive but important role of religion
                    in American society and politics. We of course had to program them officially
                    under a more anodyne rubric like “U.S. interest group politics.” Still, the
                    speakers were not only able to talk on the campuses, but also to meet with
                    officials in China's Bureau of Religious Affairs about this major factor in
                    American life. Such programs helped us provide needed context for much-resented
                    U.S. expressions of concern about religious freedom in China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the Chinese didn't complain?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: No, they didn't really object, provided we did not circumvent
                    procedures egregiously. They were in most cases interested in hearing what our
                    speakers had to say. Sometimes officials in local areas were reluctant to
                    approve a lecturand everything had to be cleared in advancbut usually a program
                    could be arranged, even at an alternate university venue. On some occasions, a
                    party cadre in the audience would feel it necessary to stand up and give a
                    lengthy rebuttal to points made by our lecturers. That was just part of doing
                    business in China.</p>
                <p>Besides the speakers, we devoted a special issue of Jiaoliu magazine to the
                    subject of religion in America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Isn't it unusual that you would even have a one-country
                        magazine after USIA shut down so many of them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Yes, it was one of the very few left at any of our posts. The key
                    people we sent it to seemed grateful for it and recipients often commented to us
                    on specific articles. I think it was an important public diplomacy asseeven
                    though we fully recognized that our mailing list of only 10,000, however
                    thoughtfully constructed, was at best reaching only a small cohort of China's
                    present and future leadership.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this all a continuation of activities begun before
                        your time as PAO in China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Yes, very much so. I was fortunate that on my watch the public affairs
                    programming environment in China opened up so quickly and widely, while my
                    predecessors missed out on seeing the fruits of their earlier labors. I hope my
                    successors will benefit in similar ways from things I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you doing this on your own premiseor with cosponsors
                        outside?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Most of the speaker presentations were at Chinese think tanks or on
                    university campuses. We would be there officially as their guests. They would
                    carry the water to get the official approvals needed for the event to go
                    forward.</p>
                <p>We also used our own facilities. In the early 1990s USIS opened an information
                    resources center at the Jingguang Center, an “offsite” location away from the
                    three heavily-guarded American Embassy compounds. It was in many respects like
                    the American Centers in Japan, but we also ran the Fulbright and IV programs
                    from there. We used a programming space for some presentations, but we didn't
                    have Japan's simultaneous translation capability, and we had to limit its use to
                    fewer than 50 attendees. Though it was obviously a USG facility, that didn't
                    seem to bother our audiences very much, particularly since many of them were
                    considered reliable “foreigner handlers” by their home offices. The advantage to
                    us was that we could invite individuals from many institutions. Most of our
                    programs there were directed at fluent speakers of English, though on occasion
                    we used consecutive interpretation or had Chinese-speaking lecturers.</p>
                <p>Sometimes we held WORLDNETs or other events right at the USIS facility, which was
                    located on the same compound as the Ambassador's residence. Memorable WORLDNETs
                    included interactive dialogues with American officials talking about upcoming
                    APEC meetings, new approaches to environmental regulation, and possible
                    restrictions on Chinese imports because of Asian Longhorned Beetle
                    infestations.</p>
                <p>Some of the branches, particularly Chengdu and Shenyang, used regular on-site
                    speaker programs to reach broader communities in which they were located. The
                    Consulate posts also had WORLDNETs and Digital Videoconferences (DVCs) with
                    American speakers. Shanghai became a leader in using the DVC medium.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me more about the beetle problem you just
                        mentioned.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: A major problem arose suddenly in late 1998 when our Animal and Plant
                    Health Inspection Servicor APHIpeople in the Agriculture Department discovered
                    an infestation of Asian Longhorned Beetles in packing materials used for Chinese
                    exports to the U.S. The Secretary of Agriculture was about to cut off imports
                    from China unless the problem could be solved by some system for certifying that
                    the wood used had been properly treated. Such an action would have affected the
                    bulk of China's billions of dollars of non-textile exports. The consequences for
                    our bilateral trade as well as for our overall relationship would have been
                    enormous.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>I got immediately to work on a public affairs strategy, which we put in place
                    with the help of the APHIS and Agriculture folks. The first task was to get the
                    announcement delayed until some public affairs groundwork could be laid, and to
                    make sure that the official statement both provided a realistic phasing-in
                    period and presented the policy in non-accusatory tones. Our job on the ground
                    was to explain to the local U.S. correspondents as well as the Chinese why this
                    action had to be taken. We set up a one-country WORLDNET with a senior officer
                    in the Department of Agriculture, who carefully explained how the beetles had
                    already destroyed many trees in New York and Chicago, and showed video news
                    clips that backed up his presentation. The Chinese were shocked, and many
                    doubtless suspected us of introducing a non-tariff barrier to reduce the
                    bilateral trade deficit. Besides using WORLDNET and other presentations, we also
                    provided detailed hand-outin Chinese as well as Englisto explain the problem and
                    how we intended to work with the Chinese to set up an eradication and
                    certification scheme that would keep the beetles out of the packing cases and
                    allow trade to continue as before.</p>
                <p>Although we often think that public affairs activities for foreign correspondents
                    don't have much impact on what we do locally, in this case I believe there was a
                    direct connection. Though the Chinese media gave scant attention to our public
                    affairs output, and even refused to accept full-page descriptions of the problem
                    we offered to pay to have placed in Chinese papers, the leadership doubtless was
                    influenced by the long and factually accurate articles written by U.S.
                    journalists we briefed, especially those appearing in the New York Times and the
                    Chicago Tribune. Thanks to our efforts, and the great work of USDA and APHIS
                    officers who gave endless briefings to Chinese exporters and port officials, the
                    new procedures were put in place with so little fuss we all counted it a minor
                    miracle.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like things had really opened up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: That's true. The police state apparatus was still theras we saw when
                    central authorities told Chinese publications not to accept our Asian Longhorned
                    Beetle placementbut overall bilateral atmospherics were greatly improved by the
                    successful visits of President Jiang Zemin to the U.S. in 1997 and by President
                    Clinton's to China in the summer of 1998.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was that “POTUS” visit like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: I was deeply immersed in that one, which took Clinton to Xian,
                    Beijing, Shanghai, and Guilin. With seven nights on the ground in China, it was
                    the longest peacetime visit by a U.S. President to any single countrexceeded
                    only by President Wilson in Paris after World War One and President Truman in
                    Potsdam at the end of World War Two. The President was accompanied not only by
                    Hillary Rodham Clinton and daughter Chelsea, but also by Mrs. Rodman, five or
                    six cabinet officers, numerous other dignitaries, and a raft of business
                    executives.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>I stayed on top of the planning from the beginning, working with the White House
                    advance team as well as with Anne Edwards and her press advance people. That
                    meant traveling several times to each of the cities on the itinerary and
                    participating in the usual endless discussions of hotel space, filing
                    arrangements, and transportation. In the end we brought on legions of volunteer
                    American residents who supplemented our assigned American and Chinese staffers
                    and provided guidance and other services to the White House correspondents.
                    Again, I asked the Agency to send me a “dream team” of my choosing, and
                    succeeded in lining up most of the people I thought would be most useful. One
                    assignment that gave me particular pleasure was to bring George Beasley back, at
                    his request, to help out as the senior USIS officer for the Xian stop.</p>
                <p>The trip was notable for the fact that both the opening joint press conference
                    between Jiang Zemin and Clinton at the Great Hall of the People and also the
                    President's speech at Peking University were broadcast live by the Chinese state
                    media. Getting to the point where that could be made to happen involved complex
                    negotiations with the Chinese, who consistently insisted that they would not
                    allow the direct transmission within China, but would permit foreign
                    broadcasters to carry live coverage from those two sites. The White House judged
                    the trip a great success because of those eventeven though the President's most
                    critical statements were not repeated in later broadcasts or picked up in any of
                    the Chinese print media. USIS was also directly involved in a live talk radio
                    program that BPAO Tony Sariti suggested for Shanghai and another long interview
                    that was carried nearly in its entirety on CCTV.</p>
                <p>The atmosphere surrounding the trip was almost euphoric. The two leaders talked
                    about working toward a “constructive strategic partnership.” It seemed like
                    democracy might flourish in China, and there was even hope for resolving the
                    Tibet issue. The public affairs part of the visit was central to its success,
                    and we all felt somehow that our sleepless nights had been worth it. Of course,
                    in the months that followed, things went south. The democracy movement was
                    squashed, tensions rose in the Taiwan Straits, no progress was made on Tibet,
                    the WTO negotiations ran into serious difficulties, and the government harshly
                    cracked down on Fulan Gong.</p>
                <p>Though not normally a fan of Presidential visits, I have to say that the Clinton
                    visit to China in 1998 was certainly one of the highest points of my career.
                    Besides being exciting and fun, it produced a helpful Chinese “party line” that
                    it was okay to be friendly to America, which opened a lot of doors to us. The
                    stress on me had been great, however. For weeks after it was all over, I could
                    not sleep through a full night undisturbed by anxiety dreams.</p>
                <p>

                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Now the official word was that “relations between the world's most
                    powerful developed country and the world's largest developing country” were
                    headed in a positive direction. One senior PRC official responsible for media
                    guidance told me they had sent guidance to the Chinese media that only positive
                    stories about the United States were to be reported by correspondents overseas!
                    That guidance had a limited shelf life, of course.</p>
                <p>The new mood helped propel what I think of as a continuing “golden age of
                    American Studies.” Just about every educated Chinese, however they might feel
                    about our country, has concluded that his or her future is somehow tied up with
                    the United States. Just as Americans are paying increasing attention to China,
                    they are looking at uand even more seriously. Their motivations of course are
                    many, but certainly include trying to understand how better to sell to us, to
                    compete with our companies, to latch on to our technology, to fend off our
                    efforts to change them, to learn the secrets of our success in maintaining
                    stability with such a large and diverse population, or simply just how to come
                    to America to build a new life here. The result is that vast numbers of students
                    want to learn more about America.</p>
                <p>We strongly supported the American Studies Center at Peking University, the
                    premier academic institution in the country. Just after his speech on that
                    campus, President Clinton presented that Center with a multi-volume special
                    collection on American institutions and ideals. We had worked with the American
                    Studies folks back in USIA to put together the collection, never dreaming that
                    it would be the President making the formal presentation. At one point we had
                    three Fulbright lecturers assigned to Peking Universitone teaching American
                    literature, one teaching U.S. constitutional law, and one teaching, among other
                    things, a ground-breaking interdisciplinary survey course in American Studies
                    that attracted more than 200 students. The lectures from the law course, given
                    by Professor Elizabeth Spahn, were put on the university's website in both
                    English and Chinese. We were excited to be doing all this at China's top
                    universitand the likely source of many future leaders.</p>
                <p>Another initiative I set in motion was to translate basic American law texts into
                    Chinese. The idea was to create an “American Law Library” that would eventually
                    total 200 volumes. Don Bishowith help from USIS staffer Yang Gengqi and our
                    Chinese and American legal community advisorhonchoed the program during my time
                    there, our successors Lloyd Neighbors and Rich Stites kept it going, and Don
                    plans to move the project along further when taking over as PAO in the summer of
                    2003. The opportunity to translate these texts in much demand by the Chinese and
                    get them sold all over the country represented an important breakthrough, one
                    that promotes positive changes at a very fundamental level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you say a little more about the Fulbright program and
                        what you were trying to do with it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Sure. Fulbright has a long history in China. In fact, the China
                    program was the first in the world to get off the ground after World War Two.
                    That Fulbright operation of course went off to Taiwan with Chiang Kai-shek. We
                    had essentially no exchanges with the People's Republic of China for the 30
                    years from 1949 to 1979, the year we set up the current structure for U.S.-China
                    Fulbright exchanges.</p>
                <p>During my tenure I promoted the idea of starting a Fulbright commission in China,
                    a proposal that could never have had a glimmer of support just a few years
                    earlier. Unfortunately, the obstacles were simply too great for us to make
                    appreciable progress. Officials at the Chinese Ministry of Education, our
                    counterparts in managing the program, gave me a respectful hearing and several
                    of them bought my arguments about the advantages that would come to both
                    countries. However, China has never allowed such a semi-autonomous binational
                    body to operate outside the tight control of Chinese officialdom, and I had to
                    content myself with the few short steps we made along the steep path toward
                    actually getting one established. Still, I am sure one day a China Fulbright
                    commission will come into being, as it has in nearly all other countries with
                    which we carry out substantial Fulbright exchangeeven many that operate on a
                    much smaller scale.</p>
                <p>One specific measure we took in the direction of broadening the oversight of the
                    Fulbright program was to set up an advisory body made up of Chinese and
                    Americans from outside the governmental chains of command. Its first task was to
                    select senior scholars and other individuals from both countries to participate
                    in a “Distinguished Lecturer Program” to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the
                    Fulbright program in the PRC. Our inaugural meeting in May 1999 was very
                    productive and encouraging. Unfortunately, it took place the afternoon
                    immediately preceding the U.S. accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in
                    Belgrade, an event that cast a pall over our relations for many months
                    thereafteand represented the nadir of my Foreign Service career.</p>

                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Essentially, all but the most routine activities came to a complete
                    standstill. For example, on the calendar for later in May was a major symposium
                    on regional security that we had been working on for months. It was to include
                    security specialists from all over Asia participating in the USIA and CINCPAC
                    annual program called the Symposium on East Asian Security, or SEAS. SEAS had
                    never before had a China stop on its program itinerary. Our cosponsors were the
                    prominent military intelligence think tank called the Chinese Institute for
                    Contemporary International Relations, or CICIR, with which we were working
                    closely for the first time. All was in readinesfor the participants and for a
                    distinguished panel of speakers that included current Assistant Secretary for
                    East Asia and the Pacific Jim Kelly. The event was canceled by the Chinese
                    immediately after the bombing. A year later, however, we joined CICIR in pulling
                    off a similar event. That one was a symposium for the annual gathering of SEAS
                    alumni from Japan, Korea, Mongolia, Russia, China, and the U.S. called the
                    Symposium on Northeast Asian Security, or SNEAS, a rotating security “Track II
                    talkfest” I got started while PAO in Tokyo.</p>
                <p>Another unprecedented event on our calendar affected by the bombing was a
                    conference set for September on U.S.-China-Russia relations. In that case we
                    were cooperating with the Chinese Institute for International Relations (or
                    CIIS), the major think tank of the Foreign Ministry. They were cautious about
                    working with us, but with terrific help from American scholar Jonathan Adelman,
                    who had strong relations with the CIIS leadership, we had finally reached
                    agreement on a workable concept that promised to meet all their concerns while
                    achieving our goals as well. That conference was also icethough it, too, was
                    successfully organized the following year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing during the crisis itself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: On the Saturday morning of the bombing, the Embassy held an Emergency
                    Action Committee meeting at the Embassy as soon as the senior officers could be
                    assembled. The Regional Security Officer told us there would be a demonstration
                    in the afternoon. We were instructed to tell our American staffers and their
                    families to stay in their apartments in the diplomatic compounds, exercise
                    proper security precautions, and await further news of developments.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>As the demonstration got under way that afternoon I rode my bike to a street
                    corner by the Embassy where I could watch what was going oall the while trying
                    to look like a harmless senior-citizen foreigner. The demonstrations were
                    orchestrated by the Chinese authorities, who worked through the Communist Party
                    cadres assigned to the universities. Two busloads from each of the major Beijing
                    universities came, each with similar banners and slogans to chant, and each
                    bearing a petition to be delivered to Embassy authorities. At first the
                    demonstrations were peaceful, and the Embassy sent representatives to the gate
                    to accept petitions. But the protests got more and more hostile as the afternoon
                    progressed, and the marchers started throwing items such as glass bottles,
                    stones, bricks, paint, and eventually Molotov cocktails. In that early period, I
                    felt pretty safe, being out there on the street along with a large contingent of
                    foreign correspondents and other onlookers, just observing developments and
                    ignoring attention directed toward me.</p>
                <p>My daughter was due to perform in a play that evening at the International
                    School, so I was keeping an eye on my watch all the while. Not knowing for sure
                    how hot things were getting in other parts of the city, I decided to go into the
                    Chancery, report to Ambassador Sasser, and then head out to the play. I slipped
                    by the demonstrators and wheeled my bike through the front gate of the Chancery
                    so I could tell those inside what I had been observing on the street. I briefed
                    the Ambassador, the Acting DCwho was Jim Moriartthe RSO, and others on what I
                    could understand of the demonstrations, what the American correspondents were
                    doing, which universities had so far marched past, and the general atmospherics.
                    Seeing that the Ambassador was on the verge of returning to his residence to be
                    with his wife, I grabbed my bike, exited the door by the front gate, and peddled
                    off through the demonstrators to find a taxi to get me to the school. I later
                    learned that my departure from the Embassy was filmed by CNN and frequently
                    carried as part of their coverage of those days. As it turned out, I had left
                    just ten minutes before the Embassy was completely shut down for the next three
                    days. In that short time, the demonstrations got uglier and the RSO urged the
                    Ambassador to stay in the Chancery, where he could be better protected by the
                    Marine guards, rather than return to his less-protected residence. The
                    Ambassador was understandably unhappy about being separated from his wife,
                    though fortunately the Sasser's adult son and some friends were there with
                    her.</p>
                <p>Not surprisingly, when I got to the school I learned that the play had been
                    canceled and all the kids had gone home, which I promptly did myself.</p>
                <p>During the first day and a half of the crisis, many of our colleagues, especially
                    those in the Chancery and at some of the Consulates, were in significant danger.
                    Though U.S. Marines protected the Chancery from direct assault, officers on the
                    spot engaged in a full-scale destruction of classified materials that might fall
                    into the hands of demonstrators should the Embassy be overrun. In hindsight, it
                    appears the danger was never that close, but several Chinese did jump the
                    compound wall and had to be confronted by Marines in full battle gear before
                    they were persuaded to jump back over the wall.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>Except for Shanghai, with its own Marine guard contingent, the other Consulates
                    were protected only by Chinese security guards. In Chengdu those guards were of
                    virtually no help. Demonstrators climbed the compound wall, set fire to the
                    Consul's residence, and smashed their way through the outer door of the
                    Consulate. They were using a bike rack to try to crash into the interiowhile
                    screaming that they were going to exact vengeancwhen city security forces
                    finally arrived and routed them. Our colleagues were understandably terrified
                    through this ordeal. They were frantically calling the Embassy and local
                    contacts, and getting increasingly agitated by the slow, almost grudging
                    response of the Chengdu authorities. During this most dangerous period I talked
                    with Min Bookbinder, the wife of the BPAO, who was then standing on the roof of
                    the Consulate staff apartment building. She had an all-too-clear view of the
                    still smoldering Consul's residence and described for me the pervasive fear that
                    the apartments were soon to come under direct attack. Chengdu staffers and their
                    families were traumatized during that period, but fortunately the situation soon
                    stabilized.</p>
                <p>I was proud of the performance under such conditions of my USIS colleagueand
                    their family members. Throughout the Chengdu crisis, BPAO Joe Bookbinder
                    performed courageously, as did those in the other two Consulates most heavily
                    attacked, Salome Hernandez in Guangzhou and Thomas Hodges in Shenyang. Shanghai,
                    where Tony Sariti and Teresa Wilkin served, was never seriously endangered,
                    though the staffers there likewise performed with distinction. Conditions were
                    exceptionally stressful for official Americans wherever they happened to be in
                    China during those first days.</p>
                <p>Happily, in the end no Americans anywhere in the country reported suffering any
                    physical harm. One Australian and I think a Canadiawho to no avail protested
                    that they were not Americans! got roughed up, but only slightly. Canadian lapel
                    buttons were in wide use by U.S. citizens during those days.</p>
                <p>Throughout the ordeal we maintained contact with the USIS Chinese employees,
                    especially those with email. Some of the USIS staffers were of great help, for
                    example by translating statements from the White House and the Secretary of
                    State.</p>
                <p>The Fulbright professors were another major concern. I was convinced that, with
                    campuses all over the country erupting with anger at the U.S., many of the
                    Fulbrighters and their families would want to be evacuated as soon as possible.
                    But none of them did request to go home. To their great credit, they all
                    hunkered down for those first tense days in their campus apartments, staying in
                    touch by email with Frank Whitaker, the ACAO in charge of the Fulbright program.
                    After a few days their Chinese handlers and colleagues at the universities
                    knocked on their doors and told them it was safe to return to normal activities.
                    The email system Frank had earlier put in place was a great communications tool.
                    We could stay up to date on the Fulbrighters' situations, give them specific
                    advice and information, and keep them apprized of Embassy thinking.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>The volume of press queries from international media was almost overwhelming.
                    Information Officer/Spokesman Bill Palmer and his deputy, Tom Cooney, fielded an
                    unrelenting onslaught of questions and requests for on-the-air descriptions of
                    the scene on the ground. I handled some of them, too. People called at all hours
                    of the day and night, both on our regular phones and on the cell-phones they
                    somehow knew we were using.</p>
                <p>Throughout the crisis, we were able to maintain the Embassy website. It was
                    regularly under attack by hackers, but our contractors somehow managed to fend
                    them off, or to quickly get it back up whenever it was taken down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean electronically, I assume.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Yes, that right. Electronically, not physically. We used the website
                    in many ways besides just communicating with each other. For example, I wrote a
                    statement for the Ambassador, expressing his regret about the mistaken bombing
                    and calling for continued good relations between the two countries. We put that
                    up, with his picture, in both English and Chinese. The Embassy's Gunnery
                    Sergeant, an excellent photographer, took a widely-used picture of the
                    Ambassador looking forlornly out through the broken glass of the front door of
                    the Chancery. The Washington Post and a lot of papers around the country carried
                    it on their front pages. Another he took showed our American flag through an
                    upstairs broken glass window of the Chancery. That one was on the front cover of
                    the Far Eastern Economic Review. We put both these photos, and several others,
                    on our website, and the news organizations picked them up from there. Chinese
                    media handlers I talked with later told me they felt very resentful when they
                    saw what we had done. They said we should have also carried pictures of the
                    devastation and deaths at the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. I explained that that
                    was not our job, but that we had carried numerous statements conveying our
                    regret for the tragic mistake. Our contacts were generally unaware of the damage
                    done to our facilities when the demonstrators got out of control, and were
                    shocked to hear that we had be showered with rocks, paint, Molotov cocktails,
                    and even human feces.</p>
                <p>Once the demonstrations had essentially run their course, we brought the USIS
                    Chinese and American staffers back to work. A few of us had gone in earlier to
                    try to clean up some of the dirt and glass chards, but we couldn't fix the
                    broken windows and there were limits to what we could do to make the premises
                    presentable before the main body of the staff returned. It was pretty bad.
                    Everybody, especially the Chinese, was deeply disturbed by what they saw. Though
                    we were not the primary target of the demonstrators, our compound was directly
                    on the main route the demonstrators walked along. The USIS facility lost about
                    85 broken windows, while perhaps a ton of rocks and other debris had been thrown
                    into our office space. Besides returning to depressingly messed up offices, the
                    Chinese staffers were still suffering the effects of having had their families
                    and friends urge them to get DSB to transfer them to new embassies and away from
                    the contemptible Americans.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>On the first day we were all back, I called the staff together and said, “Look.
                    This is what happened, as best I understand it. Many Chinese think we bombed
                    their Belgrade embassy on purpose. It was not done on purpose. It really was a
                    mistake. We understand that Chinese media and party cadres put that unflattering
                    interpretation on the accident, and that all Chinese feel very angry right now.
                    The mistake was a terrible one, and we are deeply sorry it happened. At the same
                    time, you should realize that Americans are insulted and upset with Chinese who
                    accuse us of doing it on purpose because we feel some kind of hatred toward
                    China and the Chinese people. As you can see, some Chinese felt justified in
                    attacking Americans and causing all this damage to our facilities. We in USIS
                    just have to deal with this tense bilateral atmosphere and get on with our work.
                    After all, we are the Chinese and Americans who every day try to strengthen the
                    basic fabric of relations between our two countries. That is our job, so let's
                    get on with it. But first let's have some meals together and try to relax a
                    bit.” And that is what we did.</p>
                <p>One incident that sticks out in my memory involved Ambassador Sasser, who behaved
                    with courage and dignity throughout the crisis. During those first days some of
                    the press calls got through directly to hidespite our off-site efforts to help
                    him pick and chose which interviews to accept. At least one, but perhaps more,
                    of the journalists who reached him got a quote to the effect that, being stuck
                    in the Chancery as he was, he felt like a “hostage.” His use of that term, plus
                    the wide play given to our website photos, were apparently the motivation for a
                    call from the State Department Spokesman, whunable to reach mgot through to IO
                    Bill Palmer. The message conveyed was a firm instruction that we were to stop
                    “hyping the drama” of our situation, which was distracting public attention away
                    the priority effort then under way in the former Yugoslavia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Meaning you should not react to the press queries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Meaning, I guess, that the Ambassador and the rest of us should
                    drastically tone down our on-the-record exchanges with the media. I think use of
                    the term “hostage” had roused fears that the Administration might be facing a
                    reprise of the Iran hostage crisis that brought the curtain down on the Carter
                    Administration. I passed the message on to colleagues in the Chancery, who being
                    still under siege would have preferred more sympathetic attention from
                    Washington. We all felt that, far from “hyping” anything, we were simply
                    factually informing the public about what was actually happening. Though we
                    essentially went on as before, the worst of the crisis was over by then, so
                    there was much less “drama” to talk about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did U.S.-China relations suffer permanent damage?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Sure, it was harmed, but in most respects it bounced back pretty
                    quickly. In the days immediately following the bombing, the Chinese showed that
                    they did not want the emotions of the moment to overwhelm the benefits China
                    gains from the bilateral relationship. From the get-go they were anxious to
                    protect economic relations and tourism. In fact, American tourists were going
                    about their usual activities through the whole episodand came up against no
                    particular hostility, as far as I know. And the American business community was
                    strongly encouraged by the Chinese authorities not to pull out either people or
                    investment.</p>
                <p>They also wanted to keep our educational ties going. Following the Tiananmen
                    Square tragedy in June of 1989, we suspended the Fulbright program. People in
                    both of our countries remembered that, and thought it had been a big mistake.
                    When relations are sour, that is not the time to cancel educational exchange
                    activities; you need them all the more. So both at the Ministry of Education and
                    on the campuses, officials made a special effort to emphasize to the
                    Fulbrighters and other foreign teachers, especially Americans, that their
                    presence was very welcome. Military-to-military contacts stayed on ice for quite
                    a while, but educational ties and media relations soon were much like they had
                    been before the bombing.</p>
                <p>After a couple of months, the overall climate of the relationship improved
                    substantially. We sent a delegation to give senior Chinese officials an
                    explanation of how the targeting mistake came to be made. Another delegation
                    worked out what we would pay the Chinese for the loss of life, injuries, and
                    property damage sustained in Belgradand the compensation we expected for the
                    damage done to our facilities in Beijing and elsewhere in the country. We
                    finally agreed on a payment of about $30 million to them. And they agreed to
                    give us about $3 million.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have a good explanation of what had happened? I
                        forget the details.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: We said that it was a faulty map, and using some charts and maps,
                    explained to the Chinese leadership in some detail how things went wrong. Those
                    charts and maps have never been made available to the American public! I felt,
                    and still feel, that we did a very poor job of providing a satisfactory public
                    explanation. The Chinese kept insisting that we had done it on purpose, and we
                    had no hard documentation to use in rebutting them. Unfortunately, bureaucratic
                    butt-protecting kept us from admitting our mistakeexcept through leaked
                    information that appeared in the New York Times. That put new Ambassador Joseph
                    Prueher and the rest of us in the very odd position of referring our Chinese
                    interlocutors to a newspaper article, rather than giving them an official
                    documenor, better yet, a White Papethat laid it all out.</p>
                <p>With nothing to bring the issue to closure, the bombing has entered the long list
                    of humiliations China feels it has suffered at the hands of anti-Chinese
                    foreigners over the last two centuries. I thought it was a great failure of our
                    public diplomacy, but I was unable to do anything about ieither when there or
                    after I got back to Washington.</p>

                <p>CONSOLIDATION OF USIA AND STATTHE BEIJING PERSPECTIVE</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the consolidation of USIA and State take place while
                        you were there? What was the time frame?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: The merger took place on October 1, 1999, nearly five months after the
                    Belgrade bombing, so I was in China for nearly a year of the new organizational
                    arrangement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But during that year before you got back to Washington in
                        the summer of 2000, not very much happened, did it? The consolidation took
                        place on paper, of course, but physically there not much difference, I
                        gather. Didn't people pretty much go about their business as
                        previously?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: I wouldn't put it quite that way. For one thing, on the first of
                    October, there was no more USIS. We became the Public Affairs Section. We lost
                    the name. We lost the image. We lost the self-identification.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are talking about overseas, and from your perspective
                        in Beijing. I am talking about the Washington perspective.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Back in Washington things did not change so much right away. That's
                    true. But even at headquarters everyone was very much up in the air. And the
                    East Asia office, my former area bosses, suddenly weren't directly supervising
                    me or rating me anymore.</p>
                <p>In the field losing “USIS” was a big change. For more than 50 years we had worked
                    to establish a brand, a name, a reputation for providing service. I remember
                    Jack O'Brien addressing a Rotary Club in Bangkok when I was a JOT. In those
                    remarks he had stressed that just as Rotary is a service organization, so too is
                    USIS a service organization. We really did have an institutional sense that we
                    served the public and that we were responsible for providing helpful, objective
                    information about our country. By suddenly telling our publics that we were
                    dropping “information” and “service” from our name, becoming instead the Public
                    Affairs Section, we presented a very different image. Now, it seemand feelthat
                    we represent, essentially, the State Department and its pronouncements on
                    policy. Our primary organizational raison d'etre involves advancing State's
                    interests and giving primacy to its take on foreign policy, even in areas where
                    it lacks the expertise of, say, USTR, Commerce, or Agriculture. Moreover,
                    “telling America's story” is seen essentially as of secondary importance for
                    public diplomacy professionals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who are now junior members of one department in the
                        organization?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Yes, and overseas our organizational relationship to other sections
                    became quite different. I was no longer the head of a relatively autonomous
                    section, with a distinct mandate and flexible resources to undertake everything
                    from putting on a big seminar to paying for refurbishing the PAO apartment. My
                    colleagues in the Admin Section were solicitous and in many cases avoided taking
                    precipitous action, but some had a kind of “pay-back” attitude and took
                    unilateral actions involving “our” space or personnel without telling us.</p>
                <p>In addition to such relatively minor irritants, there was a serious discussion of
                    the ways in which the public diplomacy staff should or should not be treated
                    like FSOs in other sections. DCM Bill McCahill and I had some lively
                    discussions. He candidly expressed his strong view that the position grade for
                    the head of the Public Affairs Section (PAS) should parallel those of the chiefs
                    of the Political Section and Economic Section, which were at the FE-OC level, as
                    opposed to the PAO's FE-MC. He also said that since those two sections did not
                    have deputy chiefs, PAS shouldn't either. And, furthermore, since no vehicles
                    were assigned permanently to POL or ECON, there was no need to have any
                    exclusively for PAS. The message was: “Now that you are part of the larger State
                    Department organization, you should expect nothing more and nothing less than
                    equal treatment, so be prepared to make the necessary adjustments and get with
                    the program.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the same thing happening in all countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Yes, I believe so. It was the new reality, and the arguments we were
                    all hearing from our DCMs had a lot of logic to them. I tried to present an
                    objective and persuasive case outlining the kinds of compromises all parties to
                    the new arrangement should be prepared to make. Citing the legislating mandating
                    that USIA's integration should not entail any diminution in public diplomacy
                    quantity or quality, I stressed that the State Department had not simply
                    acquired new personnel and new resources to manage, it had also taken on
                    unfamiliar responsibilities carrying unique requirements. And to do that job, we
                    would need understanding and full support from the rest of the Embassy,
                    especially the Admin Section.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>I argued that PAS should retain a deputy to help run what was still a complex
                    nationwide program. I prepared a lengthy memo for McCahill detailing the ways
                    that my responsibilities differed from those of the heads of other Embassy
                    sections. I showed, for example, that the job of the Political Minister
                    Counselor, while undoubtedly exceedingly demanding, involved relatively few
                    management tasks. Understandably, any effort to persuade a political officer DCM
                    that the PAO's position entailed more responsibility and administrative skill
                    than that of the Political Minister-Counselor was unlikely to carry the day.
                    Though McCahill and his successors as DCM, Gene Martin and Mike Marine, were not
                    persuaded by my arguments regarding either the PAO grade level or the need for a
                    deputy, the Washington management arm instructed all missions not to take
                    precipitate action until a comparative job analysis could be conducted. The
                    analysis looked at persons supervised, budgets managed, and other quantitative
                    factors. This enlightened approach was very helpful to our morale. The survey,
                    completed after I had departed Beijing, found that most PAO jobs, including the
                    one in China, did not need to be down-graded, even if they were higher than
                    other major sections of the Embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That protected you a little bit. Is that what you are
                        saying?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Basically we agreed, in Beijing and elsewhere, to wait a year or two
                    before instituting major changes. That gave our post breathing room to make the
                    transition to a new team, Lloyd Neighbors and Rich Stites in our case, without
                    everyone going through the trauma of a major shakeup.</p>
                <p>The General Services Officer (GSO), the Budget and Fiscal Officer, and other key
                    support personnel tried to be helpful, but they were essentially ignorant, as
                    they admitted, of how we operated, especially in the area of contracts.
                    Gradually they appreciated our special needfor example, that periodicals for our
                    Information Resource Center needed to be ordered on a different schedule and
                    according to different procedures than staff-use periodicals for other sections
                    of the Embassy.</p>
                <p>In the case of the USIS vehicles, initially we were allowed to keep the four we
                    had, but soon they were added to a central pool. At first GSO said we should ask
                    for drivers when we needed them. After a short time, however, they realized that
                    we had frequent need for drivers who understood our requirement to make
                    deliveries all over the city, to ferry our speakers around to unusual
                    destinations, and so forth. So we ended up with a modified system whereby
                    drivers were more or less permanently on duty at our two locationa kind of
                    satellite motor pool, if you will.</p>
                <p>In procurement, too, there was a learning process we had to suffer through. The
                    initial impulse was to treat PAS no better than any other section. However, we
                    had so much trouble getting the flexible and speedy support we needed for our
                    routine worand kicked up such a fusthat, before too many months had passed, new
                    procedures gave us quick processing when necessary, plus authority to make our
                    own small to medium purchases.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>Making these adjustments was aided by the fact that PAS activities in China and
                    elsewhere were given a separate allotment that was funded from the earmark for
                    public diplomacy Congress put intand continues to insist oin the State
                    Department budget at the time of consolidation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In giving you those early hassles you mentioned, were they
                        acting on instructions from the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: No, not in most cases. And I am not sure anyone was trying to hassle
                    us. The basic guidance from Washington was to move cautiously and work out the
                    inevitable glitches in a collegial mannewhich is what we all tried to do.</p>
                <p>Losing Executive Officer Vince Raimondi, who early on was transferred into the
                    Admin Section and given non-public diplomacy duties, was initially very
                    harparticularly since we operated out of two facilities separated from the rest
                    of the Embassy. Though we were able to keep two of our top admin Chinese
                    employees, Don Bishop had to assume many of the EO duties in addition to his
                    Deputy PAO responsibilities. Suddenly, we lost the ability to track our
                    spending, professionally rewrite our DSB/FSN job descriptions, plan inventory
                    replacements, order needed building repairs, and the like.</p>
                <p>Though never acrimonious, this transition period took up a lot of our energand
                    diverted time and attention away from our primary public affairs duties.</p>
                <p>DIRECTOR OF THE EAP PUBLIC DIPLOMACY OFFIC2000-02</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get the assignment back in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: I did not have a Washington job lined up until fairly close to my
                    departure from Beijing. My first choice was that of Director of the Office of
                    Public Diplomacy in EAP, or EAP/PD, replacing Bill Maurer. I thought that with
                    my long experience I could be of most use helping my former-USIA colleagues
                    through the first transitional years of consolidation. Some officers in EAP
                    recommended against assigning me to the job, however, because they thought I was
                    too senior and might not be a flexible team player. I believe they were also
                    concerned that, though only an Office Director, I would outrank all the other
                    FSOs in EAP, including the Deputy Assistant Secretaries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you a Career Minister by that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Yes, I had been a Career Minister since 1996 in Tokyo. For those
                    concerned with how cooperative and collegial I would be, my old friend Rusty
                    Deming, then the Principle DAS in EAP, strongly backed my candidacy, I heard
                    later. He argued that I had always been a cooperative and disciplined
                    subordinate, including when working under him in Japan and then as part of the
                    Country Team in China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you started that job when, again?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: In August of 2000. By that time the “area office” had already moved to
                    a section of the State Department that looked like, at best, slum clearance
                    housinor “the projects,” as I called those accommodations. The former USIA
                    officers were anxious about how public diplomacy money would be allocated, who
                    would control assignments, and so on. Fortunately, Bill Maurer had capably led
                    the first phase of the transition and assembled a great team of officers for me
                    to inherit. Charles Silver was a super deputy, and Craig Stromme was the number
                    three in the office, the PACO as the job was called. Craig and I had worked
                    together back in Malaysia, where he was a JOT and later the CAO during my Kuala
                    Lumpur days. As in our previous associations, he proved to be an invaluable
                    “fixer” who saved my butt many a time during those two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were people who were in the “area office” at the
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Yes. Though I was new to working in the Harry S Truman Building, Craig
                    had already been in the new EAP “Public Diplomacy Office” for more than a year,
                    and Charles had just come into the job after heading the Washington Foreign
                    Press Center. They both knew the scornot only about public diplomacy but also
                    about how the State Department functioned. Besides those two, we had many
                    first-rate desk officers, and Mary Jo Furgal was an excellent Cultural
                    Coordinator. Her job was to keep us tight with our counterparts in my old Bureau
                    of Educational and Cultural Affairs, or ECA. Later Carolyn Smith agreed to serve
                    as my secretaror “Office Management Specialist” as the new term of art has ifor
                    yet a third time. In sum, I felt exceedingly well supported during my two years
                    in that job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there were two sets of desk officers, one the
                        traditional State arrangement and the other made up of former USIS officers
                        handling public diplomacy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>BLACKBURN: That's what it waand we liked being separate. Some of the State
                    Department people strongly favored folding us into the traditional offices,
                    saying that would be a natural step in achieving full consolidation. We Public
                    Diplomacy Office Directors fought against the idea, arguing that the public
                    diplomacy officers would inevitably become caught up in the routine scut work of
                    traditional State desks. For that reason, they wouldn't be focusing sufficiently
                    on public diplomacy at the posts, wouldn't be abreast of what was going on in
                    the elements of the Department coming under the Undersecretary for Public
                    Diplomacy and Public Affairs, and wouldn't benefit from the creative synergy you
                    get when public affairs professionals work together in the same office. At the
                    initial stage of consolidation, the push toward office integration was a big
                    concern. We were afraid we'd be split up and our influence seriously
                    dissipated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was nothing in any of the agreements relating to
                        consolidation that would have protected you on this point, right? I don't
                        know what sorts of ground rules were established, but assume there was quite
                        a bit put down on paper.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: I don't think anything covered this point. However, we senior
                    former-USIA FSOs saw it as a danger from the beginning, and enlisted first
                    Evelyn Lieberman and then Charlotte Beers on our side, who gave us their
                    support. And in the end the threat receded, at least as far as EAP was
                    concerned.</p>
                <p>We were glad our old area offices moved essentially intact into the regional
                    bureaus. Though USIA lost the early effort to have the former Area Directors
                    become Deputy Assistant Secretaries, at least we became Office Directors and
                    were treated pretty well, in EAP as well as in other bureaus. For example, I had
                    fairly easy daily access to the EAP Assistant Secretary, initially Stan Roth and
                    then Jim Kelly, because I attended his morning DAS meetings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say the other Office Directors, you are talking
                        about relatively senior people who head the geographic offices, is that
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Mainly, that's true. Below the DAS level, the Assistant Secretary had
                    the Executive Office, the Regional Security Programs Office, and the Economic
                    Affairs Office, as well as the geographical offices responsible for China,
                    Japan, Southeast Asia, Australia, the Pacific Islands, and so on. He also had a
                    separate Public Affairs Office, headed by Ken Bailes, that worked on guidances
                    for the daily press briefing by the Department Spokesman, Richard Boucher.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>My extensive previous experience in Asia made my life in EAP a lot easier. I had
                    at least visited almost all the posts in the region, had been PAO in four of
                    them, and had served overseas with many of the traditional State officers.
                    Initially my immediate boss was Tom Hubbard, who replaced Rusty Deming as PDAS.
                    Tom and I had served together during my first Japan tour. I also had known Tom's
                    replacement, Chris LaFleur, for many years. So I was in no way an unknown
                    quantity or a novice in that job. Most of my EAP colleagues were friendly and
                    accepting, even when ignorant of the whys and wherefores of public
                    diplomacy.</p>
                <p>EAP's public diplomacy operations also benefitted immensely from two excellent
                    Civil Service budget officers, C.T. Forrester and Phyllis Mead. Coming over from
                    USIA into EAP/EX, they helped us keep track of the more than $20 million dollars
                    in the public diplomacy earmarked account used for FSN salaries and field
                    programs in East Asia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to maintain any control over assignments to
                        public affairs jobs overseas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Yes, essentially I was able to play a strong role in that regard,
                    though personnel matters in the State Department are much more complicated than
                    they were in USIA. The organization is so much bigger, you have to get
                    clearances from DCMs in the field as well as the DAS and others in Washington,
                    and there is nothing like an “area personnel officer” out there committed to
                    looking after your interests. Despite working in what often seemed to be a
                    personnel morass, Charles Silver and I somehow managed to recruit and assign
                    many excellent officers to the overseas posts. We brought some first-rate talent
                    from other cones into the public diplomacy ranks through this process, while a
                    number of former-USIA officers landed good jobs that previously would rarely
                    have been available to those outside the State mainstream. And I was pleased to
                    be replaced by a top flight officer, Jeremy Curtin. Unfortunately, he was a
                    little too good. Charlotte Beers snapped him away within a few months.</p>
                <p>During my tenure I tried to keep my antenna out regarding organizational and
                    administrative matters. In that sense I was always “looking for trouble.” I
                    assumed thabecause of the complexity and trauma of consolidatiothere had to be
                    lingering problems. I urged field officers to raise them and help us
                    collectively find ways to address them. At one point the EAP Admin Counselors
                    from all over the region met in Kuala Lumpur. I asked the PAOs to send me any
                    gripes or suggestions, and pulled them together in a memo for the K.L.
                    conference. Pat Kennedy, head of Administration for the Department and the man
                    most responsible for helping ease the consolidation process, used my memo as the
                    basis for what I understand was a very productive discussion. Thanks to Pat
                    Kennedy, EAP/EX Director Larry Baer, and others who tried to fix any major
                    administrative problems, I felt I was working in a supportive environment. For
                    our part, we tried to avoid bitching, or seeming to pine excessively for the
                    good old days of USIA.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>In general, I found that I could operate much as I did when I was Africa Area
                    Director. For example, I held two East Asia PAO conferences during my tenure,
                    one in Beijing and one, after 9/11, in Washington. I had feared that after
                    consolidation there might be front office sensitivities about me traveling or
                    having meetings with groups of PAOs. But no one questioned the value of such
                    activities. Although it was rare for there to be regional meetings of political
                    or economic officers, the admin and consular State people did it all the time.
                    And because I had the public diplomacy earmarked money to use; I wasn't
                    competing for travel money with other parts of EAP.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you didn't feel your hands were tied?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: No. In fact, there were some real advantages, even financial ones, to
                    the consolidation. One was that sometimes you could find unexpected sources of
                    money. For example, for the PAO conference in Washington, which gave our field
                    officers a chance to meet Charlotte Beers and other newly-installed leaders of
                    public diplomacy, I wanted to hold a classy representational event, as we would
                    normally do overseas. We thought the Foreign Press Center would be the ideal
                    venue, but learned such an event would cost well over $1,000. I took the problem
                    to Larry Baer of EAP/EX, who told me he thought he could tap a special fund to
                    cover it. I am not sure what the “special fund” was, but we got all the money we
                    needed. In USIA that never would have happened. Not in a million years!</p>
                <p>Similarly, during my tenure we decided that it would be valuable to start
                    “democracy commissions” at some of the key embassies in East Asia. These
                    commissions would give out small grants to organizations like those making
                    significant contributions to “rule of law” and democracy. The Public Affairs
                    Section people would administer the commissions, but grants could be given to
                    organizations that were key contacts of any section of the missiopolitical,
                    USAID, agriculture, whatever. They offered great opportunities to reach out to
                    new audiences. My idea was that we would put about half a million dollars of
                    public diplomacy funding into getting this project off the ground in about eight
                    countries, but that in future years the money would come from other sources
                    available within the Department, including ESF (Economic Stabilization Funds)
                    and human rights allocations. Similarly for rule of law programs in China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just a minute. Before you go any furtheisn't there a
                        Congressional mandate for democracy programs to be run out of Washington,
                        for example through the National Endowment for Democracy, or NED, and other
                        institutions connected to the two major parties? What connection is there
                        with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>BLACKBURN: There is of course some connection. NED, the Asia Foundation, Ford
                    Foundation, and other institutions have long promoted human rights in China and
                    other countries. There is also money floating around both the State Department,
                    in different offices and intended for the same purpose. Some of the funding in
                    Washington goes to NED and its affiliates, with the expectation that they will
                    find the appropriate U.S. and foreign organizations to administer programs on
                    the ground. But our embassy-based democracy commissions were to hand out small
                    amounts, generally less than $10,000, to local organizations that could really
                    use such funding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You just gave small grants, right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Yes, often it would just be a couple of thousand dollars for an
                    environmental group, a women's rights group, a journalist project, or legal
                    advocacy centeto print something, to hold a symposium, or to send someone
                    somewhere in the region for training and orientation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could these same institutions be getting money from the
                        National Endowment for Democracy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Sure. Conceivably, actually typically, they could be getting support
                    from NED, USAID, the Asia Foundation, European human rights organizations or
                    other sources. But these are people that the Embassy would also want to know and
                    support. It was not exactly “telling America's story,” but the activity built
                    strong contacts with important, influential institutions on the cutting edge of
                    positive changes in those countries.</p>
                <p>Q: What you are saying now reminds me of some of the things we were doing in
                    Japan, even as late as 1955, when I was there. We had some little groups that we
                    considered pro-democracy institutions, sometimes built up by a talented figure
                    who had influence. They used to have publications that we would help fund, and
                    our intention was as much to keep them alive with some resources as it was to
                    get the publication out with the messages it was disseminating.</p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Yes, it is quite similar. And very useful in both cases. Because of
                    consolidation, and because USIA brought in the experience and the authority to
                    administer grants, unlike other sections in an embassy, it made sense for us to
                    serve as the secretariat and influence how it operated. These commissions are
                    quite new, since consolidation, and not unique to East Asia, I should add. So
                    during my time in EAP/PD we got the ball rolling on these commissions.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>After 9/11, we of course paid particular attention to the Islamic countries of
                    Southeast Asiespecially Indonesia and Malaysia, but also Thailand and the
                    Philippines, with their substantial Muslim populations. We used whatever spare
                    money we could find, in or out of the public diplomacy account, to try to
                    establish relations witor improve relations witmoderate Islamic forces in those
                    societies. Besides what we had in EAP/PD, I was able to get money from Charlotte
                    Beers' reserve account, a very large account actually, from ECA, and elsewhere.
                    We had strong arguments to make for our Indonesia programs. Greta Morris, our
                    PAO, worked closely with Charles Silver, Craig Stromme, and desk officer Lynn
                    Sever to come up with many great ideas for bringing leaders of moderate Islamic
                    educational institutions to the U.S., for a high-profile post-9/11 journalist
                    group, for special publications, and the like. Because we are now part of State
                    we could much more easily make use of USAID money. For example, we got $500,000
                    from AID for a special Fulbright program on religious tolerance in Indonesia.
                    That transfer would have been less likely to go to USIA.</p>
                <p>A mixed blessing of all this collaboration after consolidation is that now there
                    are many traditional State officers, who had never paid much attention to USIA
                    or USIS, who now know considerably more about our capabilities. In those two
                    years before my retirement, I heard more and more ideas about how the public
                    diplomacy money should be spent. Some of the ideas were terrific, others
                    terrible, but most deserved a fair hearing and a time-consuming discussion. That
                    was not difficult for me, but at posts abroad, it was often hard for officers to
                    handle dubious public diplomacy “suggestions” from their DCMs and
                    Ambassadors.</p>
                <p>Of course, we have to be open to new ideas, to new public affairs issues, and to
                    new ways of getting across our messageeven when our teachers are traditional
                    State officers with little experience in our field. No longer can we say, “This
                    is a USIA program. Leave me alone.” Instead, when necessary we have to counter
                    with arguments like, “OK, here is how your idea fits with the Mission or
                    Bureau's program plan we all have agreed to. If we do what you suggest, the
                    resource and impact trade-offs will be such and such.” For example, a senior EAP
                    officer told me he wanted the speaker office to send a friend of his to give
                    lectures in a certain country. I had to explain that to do so the post would
                    have to abandon its plans for a different speaker to come address a higher
                    priority subject. Nobody likes to hear such a bureaucratic response, but
                    sometimes it is appropriate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The same problem exists both in Washington and the field,
                        doesn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>BLACKBURN: I would say so. Most critical is that we prepare for the day that the
                    public diplomacy earmark goes away, as it certainly will at some point.
                    Anticipating a coming hot debate about the proper boundaries of “public
                    diplomacy,” I urged our PAOs in the field to keep careful account of how much
                    they were spending for their major activities. In the future, when the wall goes
                    down, they will be able to explain that they have been funding information and
                    cultural activities at such and such level in the past. They can then argue
                    that, in conformity with Congressional strictures to maintain the size and
                    quality of the public diplomacy effort, the same amounts should be set aside for
                    those purposeat each Embassy and in Washingtoeven without a specific
                    earmark.</p>
                <p>It's not a great situation. I mourn the passing of USIA as much as anybody, but
                    we had a rough patch in our final days, certainly, and </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As an independent agency, you mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: We never really caught our breath after the end of the Cold War, or
                    after Charlie Wick left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you deal with the field posts after consolidation,
                        especially after you were no longer doing performance ratings or had
                        supervisory responsibility over the PAOs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Actually, I found it not all that different from when I was the Area
                    Director for Africa in USIA. People in the field still depended on my office for
                    much of their funding, including quite a lot of discretionary money. They were
                    still assigned or not assigned with me having a big say-so in their futures. And
                    they needed to explain what they were doing, or had decided not to do, in order
                    to get direct support from my officand to make it possible for us to run
                    interference for them in their dealings with other parts of the public diplomacy
                    bureaucracy back in Washington, like the IV or Fulbright programs. Some of them
                    sent us “game plans” or other periodic planning documents that looked a lot like
                    the old USIA Country Plans. And they all shared with us the public diplomacy
                    inputs they made into their embassy's Mission Program Plan, and we contributed
                    to the Bureau's commentary on those plans. Not that much different, really.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>After 9/11 we were required to report on what the posts were doing to spread the
                    message that America is not hostile to Islam, that we were only after terrorists
                    like al Queda, and that the international community and the U.S. shared the same
                    overall goals. The embassies of East Asia, including the Public Affairs
                    Sections, made tremendous contributions to this effort, and I was glad to see
                    them get credit for their hard-won accomplishments. Making use of the ease of
                    communication afforded by email, the posts reported to my office, often daily,
                    on what they were doing. If a major post didn't report for a few days, we would
                    call them up and ask where the report was, explaining that it was needed for
                    reporting within the Department. In making the process work, I was often
                    reminded of the old days, when the USIA area offices would cajole or berate our
                    PAOs to get information out of theand some were cooperative and some not so
                    cooperative. Basically the dynamic is the same, even without the old strict
                    lines of authority. The posts depend on headquarters for information, resources,
                    and Washington back-stopping, and the Washington main office depends on the
                    field for up-dates on activities and, where possible, “evidence of
                    effectiveness.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like you didn't use cables very much.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: At least 90% of the written communication in and out of our office was
                    by email. Contrary to concerns I had had that interchanges with the PAOs by
                    email might not be welcomed by DCMs and others at the missions, in today's State
                    Department there are no longer such efforts at tight control. It was a welcome
                    change. We would have been sunk if we had to rely on cables. Nothing would ever
                    get cleared, and, without email, all the essential informal communications would
                    have been by telephone. I am not talking about end-runs here. Within our office
                    and at the posts, we expected that all e-mails would contain a “cc” to
                    anybodlike a DCwith a need to know about the communication being carried on. And
                    after pulling together highlights from the daily post-9/11 public diplomacy
                    reports from the field, we would forward our wrap-up to more than 50 overseas
                    and Washington addresseeincluding the two or three people in the Department who
                    needed it for their own reporting up the line.</p>
                <p>A few of my public diplomacy counterparts in other bureaus, facing a much more
                    difficult working environment than we did, would got irritated when I said that
                    in EAP the consolidation was working reasonably well. It was true, nonetheless.
                    Our relative success had to do with several factorgood personal relations, the
                    helpful attitude of EAP/EX, and plenty of work already on everyone's plate. Our
                    morale and working effectiveness got a boost when, halfway into my tenure, we
                    into comfortable quarters near other EAP offices. We got space design advice,
                    informally, from Lynn Nyce, provisioned it with up-to-date videoconferencing and
                    other AV capabilities, and decorated it with beautiful mounted fabric pieces
                    sent in from each of the countries in the region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you think the current arrangement works just fine?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>BLACKBURN: I wouldn't go that far. There are certainly organizational weaknesses
                    that continue. For example, I wish we could have worked out a way for there to
                    be more public diplomacy consideration in policy discussions. I argued for
                    establishing a Deputy Assistant Secretary, or DAS, responsible for strategic
                    communication. My suggestion was not intended to resurrect the failed effort to
                    bring USIA Area Directors into the Department at the DAS level. Instead, my
                    point was that someonformer USIA officer or noshould sit in each bureau's front
                    office and exercise supervisory responsibility not only over the Public
                    Diplomacy Office but also over the daily press guidance function of the Public
                    Affairs Office and the overseas grant programs handled by each bureau's Regional
                    Affairs Office. Currently, the Public Diplomacy Office Director reports to the
                    Principal DAS, or PDAS, of each bureau. That is fine and flattering in some
                    ways, but the arrangement means that the Public Diplomacy Office Director, who
                    has responsibility for supporting programs long-term objectives, works under the
                    supervision of an extremely busy officer whose day is inevitably consumed with
                    short-term crises of the moment.</p>
                <p>A “strategic communications DAS” would participate in high level meetings with
                    NSC staffers and others where broad policy issues are discussed, if not decided.
                    As it is, there is no room for a relatively low-level Office Director in such
                    meetings, nor is the PDAS likely to give emphasis to that dimension of our
                    foreign relations. Nor is he or she likely to take notes for briefing the public
                    diplomacy staffers on what transpired there.</p>
                <p>My proposal to a group that included Barry Fulton </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Barry was where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Barry was assigned to work with Ruth Whiteside on ideas for improving
                    public diplomacy in the Departmenas part of an effort coordinated by Grant
                    Green, the Undersecretary for Management. He and Ruth liked my concept and
                    included it in their recommendations to Secretary Colin Powell. What happened
                    then I do not know. There was a lot of institutional resistance to the idea of
                    adding any new DASes to the Department's organizational structure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Barry doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: He was working on contract to Grant Green, advising on management
                    issues. He is also at George Washington University at the Public Diplomacy
                    Institute there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is he with McKinney Russell and Bruce Gregory at the
                        Institute?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>BLACKBURN: I think they are all involved in it somehow, though McKinney also runs
                    the Public Diplomacy Foundation, I believe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Go on with your comments about organizational issues in
                        the Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: The biggest problem with public diplomacy in the State Department,
                    however, is not whether or not the DAS positions get established in regional
                    bureaus. It is the structure of the office of the Undersecretary of Public
                    Diplomacy and Public Affairs. Charlotte Beers was rather surprised when I told
                    her that, but I think the case is clear-cut.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is what I was going to say. You've been talking about
                        a certain level of the issue, whereas you haven't been dealing so much with
                        the senior echelon perspective. After all, that is where the dynamism and
                        energy for public diplomacy has to come from. Leadership from high in the
                        Department is needed to be a unifying force.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: I completely agree. My previous experience as a USIA Area Director
                    gave me perspective on the problem. When I was Area Director for Africa, I got a
                    lot more guidance and support from the USIA Director than Charlotte Beers was
                    organizationally able to give me. She had neither the staff resources nor the
                    time to carry out that sort of function. Perhaps not the inclination,
                    either.</p>
                <p>One big structural difference is that the Undersecretary, like other under
                    secretaries, is not supposed to be “operational” and does not have a deputy.
                    That may be a nice idea for other parts of the Department, but it certainly
                    causes problems for public diplomacy operations. If there is no deputy, the
                    Undersecretary can only very occasionally afford to travel away from Washington.
                    And, alternatively, if the Undersecretary can't travel to an important overseas
                    conference or event, there is no deputy who can represent him or her. The
                    Department's second most important public diplomacy official is the Assistant
                    Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA), in this case the very able
                    Pat Harrison. But that person has no responsibility for field programs other
                    than those handled by ECand that leaves out speakers, publications, and
                    information resource centers, for example.</p>
                <p>Even worse, there is no front office continuity between administrations. In the
                    hiatus between the Clinton and Bush administrations the one ranking public
                    diplomacy official to serve as Acting Undersecretary was Richard Boucher, the
                    Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs. His spokesman duties, however, were so
                    time-consuming he gave virtually no attention to the broader issues of public
                    diplomacy. So we had no leadership whatsoever. In the USIA days this role during
                    transitions would have gone to the Counselor, a senior FSO who could provide
                    needed leadership until the new team was in place.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>The Undersecretary also needs a senior person to perform the functions of the old
                    USIA Counselofor example to look at morale issues, training, and other big
                    picture issues affecting our profession. The people now in that office have
                    little if any authority. Neil Walsh, the senior FSO there when I retired, mostly
                    worked on liaison with the radio broadcasting elements and held meetings with
                    the bureau Public Diplomacy Office Directors. But he had little organizational
                    heft and could not really represent either the Undersecretary or those of us in
                    the public diplomacy ranks.</p>
                <p>When I was USIA Africa Area Director, if there was a question of how resources
                    should be divvied up among different elements of the Agency, you had a Henry
                    Hokheimer or a resource management committee or other means for bringing people
                    to the table and settling the matter. Ben Posner had established the prototype
                    system decades earlier, and it worked well for us in that era.</p>
                <p>In the aftermath of 9/11 we sorely lacked any means for setting broad priorities
                    and discussing whether current resourceor new resourceshould be directed toward
                    publications for the Islamic world, toward promotion of English teaching, toward
                    book translations, toward high school exchanges, or whatever. We could then have
                    discussed which activities should take the hit. There was really no
                    capabilitnobody “up there” to do that. Instead, decisions were made by Charlotte
                    Beers and her inner circle without broad consultation with experienced public
                    affairs professionals. Had we been more involved, we perhaps could have helped
                    her avoid the public embarrassment she faced after wasting $15 million for a
                    blatantly pro-America ad campaign that flopped in the Arab world.</p>
                <p>At least as serious was the absence of a staff to focus on the substance of
                    foreign policy. Charlotte had no proper policy staff to brief her, to prepare
                    her for senior meetings, or to help us all develop new themes and program
                    directions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Please tell me a bit about the “global PAO conference” in
                        early 2002 that Charlotte Beers initiated and that attracted so much
                        attention, pro and con.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Well, I thought it was a pretty good idea. After all, PAOs all over
                    the world wanted to get a sense of what was going on with public diplomacy in
                    the post-9/11 era and consolidated State Department under the leadership of
                    Colin Powell, Rich Armitage, and Charlotte Beers.</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>Charlotte's vision was that we would bring everyone together to hear
                    inspirational speakers, from the Department or from outside, much as is done
                    with large corporations introducing new products. At one point she was even
                    thinking of bringing in Martha Stewart. The main concept was that people who
                    have been successful selling products would talk to us, with an implicit
                    assumption that our officers in the field needed to improve their communication
                    skills. The PAOs would be coming to town, not to report on conditions in the
                    field, but to learn something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or be inspired. Some of the notes I saw that were made on
                        the conference indicated that inspiration was a big part of it. You have to
                        believe in your product. You have to believe in what you are doing. You
                        should have a sense of mission. It was a sort of pep talk.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Oh, definitely that was there. But I think I can take credit for
                    helping turn the conference into more of a dialogue. I said that if the
                    inspirational and teaching part was going to be palatable and useful to our
                    folks, there had to be opportunities for the PAOs to speak up about matters that
                    they considered important. Charlotte's planning team came up with “scenarios”
                    for treating real world public diplomacy problems and hearing from them about
                    their “best practices.” The PAOs made some excellent presentations for
                    Department leadermostly just Charlotte, as it turned out in practice. Charlotte
                    stayed for the whole conference, and at the end of it gave a brilliant summing
                    up that showed the participants she had absorbed at least as much as she had
                    imparted during the conference. Despite their negative reaction to the
                    communications training component, the PAOs, even many of the most cynical among
                    them, left town with much of the pep and enthusiasm Charlotte had hoped to
                    impart.</p>
                <p>And I was glad to have the East Asia PAOs get to town again for an opportunity to
                    share some final thoughts before the transition in my office's leadershiand my
                    own departure for the golden years of retirement.</p>
                <p>Not all our interactions with Charlotte Beers went smoothly. At one point Deputy
                    Secretary Armitage instructed her to contribute $5 million of “her”
                    discretionary funds to meet some kind of a Department shortfall. To get that
                    amount, shwithout consulting uscooped up five percent of the funds allocated to
                    us in each of the regional bureaus. She had a perfect right to do so, as all
                    public diplomacy money in the Department was under her broad authority. Later
                    she explained to us that she saluted so quickly because she wanted to show the
                    Department leadership that we in public diplomacy were disciplined team members.
                    Her ultimate objective, she said, was to use this action as a demonstration of
                    good faith and sound financial management that would lay the basis for a
                    substantial public diplomacy increase in the post-9/11 supplemental then under
                    preparation in the Department. Whatever the long-term prospects for her
                    stratagem, we were shocked by her sudden hit on our operations. Charlotte's
                    “five percent solution” as we dubbed imeant for EAP public diplomacy that out of
                    a $20 million budget, we had overnight lost half of the $2 million in non-fixed
                    costs I had intended to use for democracy commissions, assignments of retirees
                    to meet emergency staffing needs, and the like.</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>When all of us in the bureaus protested, Charlotte said she hadn't expected it
                    would upset us so much. She figured we had been sitting on extra money that
                    could be readily sopped up. Happily, she repaired most of the damage by
                    encouraging us to send in specific requests for funding from her “reserve.” In
                    the end I got back about two-thirds of the million dollars I had coughed ufor a
                    new publication in Indonesia and for additional funds for the democracy
                    commissions.</p>
                <p>THE FUTURE OF PUBLIC DIPLOMACY</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where do you think public diplomacy will, or should, go
                        from here?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: As long as it stays in the State Department it will inevitably be
                    hamstrung. Without some autonomy and with no possibility of a direct link to the
                    White House, public diplomacy may hold its own but can never thrive. Still, I
                    definitely don't think we should try to build a USIA-type structure within the
                    State Departmenthough I know some of the USIA alums have been pushing that idea.
                    While I recommended reorganizing the Undersecretary's office to give it some
                    USIA elements, I would not give it direct responsibility for field programs,
                    including doing performance evaluations of PAO's. Nor would I put the regional
                    bureau Public Diplomacy Offices directly under it. That would be a recipe for
                    making them much, much less influential than they are noor are capable of
                    becoming.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And much less effective in the field, I would
                        suspect.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Right. Not of much use to the overseas posts either.</p>
                <p>I hope the alums will remain active in feeding ideas to Congressional staffers,
                    the Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy, and others concerned with how our
                    profession is faring in the Department. On the table are many large
                    questionbesides the organizational issues. In this post-9/11 era how can we best
                    present our society and our policies to foreign publics? To what extent should
                    we again be concentrating on mass audiences, particularly in the Islamic world?
                    How about secondary students, especially in religious schools? What are the
                    respective roles of radio and TV broadcasting? Are we making effective use of
                    new tools such as the Internet and Digital Videoconferencing? Should we give
                    more priority to English teaching? How about cultural centers? What role is
                    there for hard-copy publications? How can public diplomacy professionals work
                    more effectively not only in the State Department but also with relevant parts
                    of USAID and the Defense Department? Though these are critical questions, those
                    who work on the inside of the Department these days lack both time and
                    encouragement to address them.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Many of the ideas you have touched on there are in the
                        Hyde Bill that came out of the House. I suspect they all came from the
                        alumni.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: Many straight from Barry Fulton, as well as others, I believe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When I read it I thought it was quite a hodgepodge,
                        everything but the kitchen sink, everything the Agency was ever involved in.
                        And it is a Congressional committee telling the State Department to do all
                        these things, and then come back and report on a periodic basis. And it was
                        the kind of a bill that I thought the Department would choke on, and
                        couldn't swallow. And they came back with that nasty letter. Did you see it?
                        Did you ever see the letter the Department sent back to Hyde about that
                        piece of legislation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: No, I didn't see the letter, but I heard about it.</p>
                <p>Q: It was terrible. Just snide and insulting, really. And I thought it made the
                    Department look terrible. And most of all it made Charlotte Beers and her office
                    look bad, because she obviously had to sign off on that letter, or to have been
                    a participant in some way in how that letter was framed. And I thought it just
                    made the whole public diplomacy machinery look bad.</p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: There is definitely that problem. Rich Armitage, for example, while a
                    strong believer in the public diplomacy function, is said to want it under much
                    tighter central control. He especially resents the earmark Congress keeps
                    putting in the State budget, believing that the Department leadership should be
                    able to decide what the public diplomacy activities will be and the amount of
                    money given to each of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that was very clear in that letter.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLACKBURN: I expect the long-term future of public diplomacy in the State
                    Department will be rocky. The problem is not ill will, organizational turf
                    battles, or even disdain for the function, but rather that many of our
                    activities have low priority within that kind of bureaucracy. Even
                    extraordinarily enlightened State Department leadership, such as that currently
                    given by Colin Powell and Rich Armitage, will inevitably question why public
                    diplomacy has so much money and so many resources for programs that do not lend
                    direct support to immediate foreign policy interests. The USIA and CU culture of
                    long-term relationships and long-term programs really conflicts with the
                    fundamental State Department culture of short term objectives set by whatever
                    Administration is currently in power. Of course I am not here speaking of the
                    broadcasting, press relations, and spokesman functions within public diplomacy.
                    Those will always have respectful high-level attention.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>When I delved into the history of public diplomacy for my course at Georgetown, I
                    found that virtually no major exchanges initiativefrom the Fulbright program to
                    the Humphrey program and right on througoriginated in the Executive branch.
                    Instead, they came from the Congress, responding to constituencies within the
                    American academic and foundation communities. Even from the early days of USIA,
                    no Administration has cared deeply about the long-term objectives of public
                    diplomacy. Though they get much lip service and probably would never face total
                    elimination, cultural and educational programs are perpetually threatened by the
                    knife. Recognizing this fact of life, Congress typically gives ECA more money
                    than the Administration requests and earmarks much of it. Lately, they have done
                    the same for the entire public diplomacy budget.</p>
                <p>It is understandable that an extremely able bureaucratic player like Armitage
                    would want access to that funding, and that Congress, responding to the domestic
                    constituency that favors exchanges, would try to thwart his efforts. I expect we
                    will see a similar dynamic when the next team comes in to lead the Department.
                    And the one after that as well.</p>
                <p>It won't always be a comfortable situatioand there is certainly much one can
                    criticize about current operations - but, in one organizational guise or
                    another, public diplomacy will surely retain its place as a key element of
                    America's foreign policy. While curious to see how the story unfolds, I am
                    deeply grateful to have been along for so much of the ride up to this
                    juncture.</p>
