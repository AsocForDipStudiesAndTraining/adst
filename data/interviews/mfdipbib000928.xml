                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is September 26, 1991. This is an interview with
                        Ambassador Alberto M. Piedra concerning his work with the Department of
                        State. This is being done on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic
                        Studies and I am Charles Stuart Kennedy. Mr. Ambassador, I wonder if you
                        would give me a little about your background? Where did you come from, where
                        were you educated, etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: I was born in Havana, Cuba but brought up primarily in Europe. I went to
                    private schools in England for three years when I was a little boy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When were you born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: I was born in 1926. I was sent off to British schools at the age of eight
                    in 1934 and I stayed in England at St. Edmonds College for three years and from
                    there I was sent to Switzerland to study French and continue my studies. I
                    stayed there two years until the war broke out. When the war broke out we came
                    back to America just prior to the Germans coming into France. In New York I
                    stayed for another two years at Royolla high school on Park Avenue and from
                    there went back to Havana. There I finished my high school and then went to the
                    university where I got my law degree. That was in 1948. After graduating I
                    decided to study in Europe so I went to the University of Madrid for almost two
                    years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you studying there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: I was studying what they call in Europe political economy which is a
                    mixture of political science and economics. Then I returned to Havana in 1951
                    and decided to get a Ph.D. in the United States because I always thought it
                    would be better for me living in America to have a degree from the United States
                    even though I had a degree from Europe. So I decided to go to Georgetown.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This interview is taking place at Georgetown
                        University.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: I started my studies in 1952 and proceeded towards my Ph.D. but it was
                    interrupted in 1959 because of the Cuban revolution. In fact I went back in May,
                    1958 and the revolution came and Fidel Castro, among others, asked me whether I
                    would join the government. Even though I was never a fan of Fidel Castro's I
                    knew him from school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to ask where...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: I knew him from the university. It was not a very close relationship but
                    he had been to my home several times. When Batista fell and Castro came to
                    Havana, etc., they called me one day and asked me if I would like to join the
                    government. I had grave doubts about it for several reasons, but I was
                    approached by many friends. Being a moderate, myself, the idea at that time was
                    that it was better for you to occupy a position because otherwise if you don't
                    maybe some radical person would take the position and it was better for you to
                    do it.</p>
                <p>To make a long story short, I did join the government around the 16th or 17th of
                    January. I was director general of exports and imports. This would be more or
                    less equivalent to the assistant secretary in the Department of
                    Commerce—possibly under secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For a country like Cuba exports and imports would be
                        extremely important.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: I had about 300 employees there. I stayed there until May at which time I
                    began to see all sorts of things that were not in accordance with my own
                    criteria of how things should be. In terms of hiring and firing of people it was
                    done in a way I did not agree with at all. So, I decided to quit. So I went to
                    the Minister, and told him...one was always careful for at that time you already
                    had the beginnings of the symptoms of a dictatorial regime...I was afraid a
                    little bit in terms of my family and myself, that they would not let me get out.
                    So what I did was to tell him that I had not finished my degree at Georgetown,
                    still had the dissertation to do, and felt it would be better for me to return
                    to the United States, finish my degree, get my Ph.D., etc., and then return to
                    Cuba and be more helpful and of greater service to the revolution. He accepted
                    this. Whether he believed it or not, I don't know.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>So I left for Washington. I stayed here and visited New York, Boston, etc. And
                    then I got so many letters from Havana telling me that I was wrong, that I
                    should continue in Havana, that it wasn't as bad as I thought it was, that it
                    was just a Cuban reform movement, that I should return. I had my grave doubts
                    again, but nevertheless my wife was expecting my third child and of course she
                    wanted me to go back to Havana. She wanted at that time to have the child in
                    Cuba. So I went back to Havana.</p>
                <p>I did not go back to the government, but I went back to the University where I
                    was teaching. I stayed there about three months and in September I told my wife
                    now is the time to leave for good. No matter what they tell me I think I am
                    right, I honestly believe that they are wrong, that this is going towards some
                    communist dictatorial regime so I think we ought to leave.</p>
                <p>So, in September I left. I came back to Washington and started looking for a job.
                    My wife did not leave because the baby was born in June and she wanted to wait a
                    few months so she didn't leave until about December. In the meantime I got a job
                    at the OAS, Organization of American States. That is how I began my professional
                    career in the States. Finally my wife joined me in December and we have stayed
                    in Washington ever since. We have lived in Washington since 1959.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it that you were not part of the Cuban exile
                        community that developed particularly around Miami?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: No, I was not. As you can well imagine I knew many of the people who
                    afterwards left Cuba and I maintain fairly close contact with some of them in
                    Miami. But I have never been part of that community in the sense that we have
                    been in Washington and they have been in Miami.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The reason I mention this is for someone looking at this
                        in the future, this group, as often an emigre group does, is much concerned
                        with Cuba, internal politics and also the emigre politics within an
                        area.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: We were concerned with internal politics in Cuba because after all it was
                    the country we were born in. But I was not directly involved in any internal
                    politics that took place in Miami.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if you would talk a little about your time on the
                        OAS staff. You were there from 1960-62 and would return 20 years later. How
                        did you see the OAS operating in the early 60s, the time when the Alliance
                        of Progress was just getting started and all that? And America's role in the
                        OAS, was there a change when you got into it later on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>PIEDRA: Well, obviously you have to realize that I was at an entirely different
                    level when I was at the OAS the first time so therefore my approach was slightly
                    different.</p>
                <p>Now I think and have always maintained that the OAS has a role to play...it
                    played it in the past and I think it can play it in the future.</p>
                <p>When I was there the first time I think the OAS was much more involved in
                    economic matters. It was also involved in political matters, obviously, but I
                    think greater stress was placed on economic aspects. Maybe the reason for this
                    was that at that time the Inter-American Development Bank was just beginning, as
                    you know. It was in its very initial stages. As the Bank developed it took over
                    many of the economic functions of the OAS. Therefore that particular role of the
                    OAS has definitely declined, in my opinion. I may be wrong. That does not mean
                    that the OAS does not have a role to play, but I don't think it is as
                    significant as it was before.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, from a political point of view, on a regional basis, I think it has
                    solved problems. I think it has solved problems, maybe of what you might call on
                    a global level of a minor importance, but from the point of view of the area, it
                    has played a significant role in the Honduran and Salvadoran conflict as well as
                    other territorial conflicts. So from that point of view it did play a role, it
                    is still playing a role and I think it can continue from our point of view to
                    play a role.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Between 1960-62 and 1982 you left the OAS and before you
                        came back to the OAS as the number two person in the US Delegation, what
                        were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: I left the OAS in 1962 and was approached by Catholic University and
                    offered a professorship in the area of the development in Latin American
                    affairs. I have always liked teaching. Perhaps that is one of my weak spots. I
                    accepted it and left the OAS and went into teaching where I remained for all
                    those years. Although I was always in contact with international affairs through
                    international organizations, congressmen, the World Bank, etc. So I was always
                    very interested in world affairs and in a very special way, obviously, in Latin
                    American affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did your appointment to be the number two person in
                        the US Delegation to the OAS come about? You served there from 1982-84.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: In all honestly it is difficult to tell. I guess it came about because I
                    had contacts in the Senate and Congress. I suppose they needed somebody in Latin
                    American affairs and in a very special way I also knew Ambassador
                    Middendorf.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the chief of the delegation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: Apparently they talked to Ambassador Middendorf and they said he needed
                    somebody who would be a specialist in Latin American affairs. He called me one
                    day and said, “Alberto I would like you to become my second at the OAS.” I
                    thought about it and since I am very much interested in the area I said, “Yes.”
                    When I mentioned before that one of my weak spots is teaching, I have to be
                    frank and say that diplomacy has always attracted me, not politics. One must
                    make the distinction. Diplomacy has always attracted me. I like dealing with
                    people. I am very socially inclined. Getting involved with persons...I have
                    always enjoyed that.</p>
                <p>And let me add that we did maintain through all these years very close contacts
                    with the different Latin American embassies, so we had close contacts with
                    ambassadors, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">This is the early Reagan Administration which had been taking
                        a jaundiced look at the United Nations, etc. Did this carry over in its
                        attitude towards the Organization American States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: I do believe for many problems, especially in the region areas it was
                    easier for the United States to get backing within the OAS than a global
                    institution like the United Nations where at that time there were the Soviet
                    bloc countries, third world blocs, etc. which would for various reasons often
                    vote against the United States. So for us it was easier to get the results we
                    wanted by operating within a regional organization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it wasn't quite the same attitude as it was towards the
                        United Nations—almost an attitude of disdain?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: No, no, I definitely would not say that. It is not a question of disdain.
                    It is a question maybe of tactics if you wish, but it would be easier in many
                    ways, I suppose, when a regional issue came up to get support within the
                    hemisphere then it would be to go to the United Nations when you knew beforehand
                    that you were going to get the opposition of x number of votes. Here, within our
                    region, there was a greater possibility of us being able....</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You could work with the situation.</hi>

                <p>PIEDRA: I wouldn't call it disdain, I would call it for tactical reasons it was
                    easier for us to get the results... Let's be very frank about this. Let's put
                    the case of Cuba. Any issue involving Cuba would be much more difficult at that
                    time, today things have changed, to get the support of whatever members of the
                    UN than it would be of the OAS.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: We were in this particular incidence divided between our allegiance
                    towards Latin America...most Latin American countries took the side of the
                    Argentine...and on the other hand we also had our allegiances towards Britain
                    for obvious reasons that we don't have to go into, plus the fact that it was an
                    invasion. It was a territorial invasion of an area of the world that was under
                    the British flag and they used military force and power to do it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: That's right. These factors made it difficult for us in the sense we
                    wanted to be on the side of Latin America but on the other hand we realized that
                    in these particular circumstances it was very difficult to take a position that
                    would please our Latin American neighbors in the South. And then we could not
                    accept a violation of international law which in reality it was.</p>

                <p>PIEDRA: One of the issues which was raised many, many times that concerned me
                    particularly was the reaction that the Latin Americans would have towards the
                    United States if we took the position of anti the Argentine. That concerned me
                    very much because I was worried that our actions in “favor” of Britain, for
                    example, would boomerang against us possibly in the long run because it would
                    leave a trace of...at the time when the chips were down you didn't back us you
                    backed them. That was the conflict that arose. I mentioned it many times. It was
                    a difficult decision and I am sure that those at the highest levels in
                    government were concerned about this. On the one hand we did not want to
                    antagonize the Latin American countries, on the other hand Britain was involved
                    and there was an invasion. So it was not an easy thing for us to do.</p>
                <p>General Haig, Secretary of State at that time, did try by all means to work out
                    an agreement.</p>

                <p>PIEDRA: Yes, I remember. I was involved in that here in the Washington area. But
                    unfortunately, Galtieri was so stubborn.</p>

                    all possibilities of an honorable retreat he didn't accept it. From that point
                    of view I think he was extremely foolish and stupid. Until the very last moment
                    I think an agreement could have been reached. We tried, I really mean it. I know
                    this is true. We tried every which way to do so.</p>

                        and problems for the United States?</hi>

                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>PIEDRA: I think there was an understanding. I think here again the same thing we
                    had the problem with Britain on the one hand and the invasion of the Falkland
                    Islands on the other, they also experienced on the one hand they realized that
                    there was something wrong here, the way it was done. I would tend to say that
                    they would sympathize for the Falklands to be returned to the Argentine. They
                    had a sense of loyalty towards the Argentine. But on the other hand there were
                    two problems: First, the way it was done and secondly, they did not sympathize
                    with Galtieri. So this was the clash that existed. However, as they demonstrated
                    by their vote they did solidify themselves with the Argentine. I think there was
                    the sense of loyalty in Latin America of “let's all be together,” etc. And, of
                    course, this was used by the more leftist governments in Latin America to accuse
                    the United States of all sorts of imperialism, involvement in internal affairs
                    of the region, etc.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: No. I have to admit and I admitted openly that I think I over rated the
                    reactions that would come in the future. I thought the reaction would stay there
                    and on the basis of conversations that I had I honestly thought that there would
                    be much more hard feelings. But I would agree with what you said now. It seems
                    to be long forgotten...I don't think anyone remembers. To be honest with you, I
                    think from that point of view that I over rated the possibility of the negative
                    reaction in the future.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: Especially when you talk with some of the people you dealt with who were
                    directly involved. I think the long run effect of all this, unless something

                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: The person who sponsored me was Jesse Helms. I hardly knew him
                    personally, but I knew some of the people who worked for him. I knew some of the
                    people who had been in contact with Senator Helms. Plus the fact that I was a
                    good friend of Ambassador Middendorf who also had at that time a good deal of
                    influence in the government. I was also a good friend of Jeane Kirkpatrick who
                    had a lot of influence. I was a good friend of many people in the government at
                    the time that backed me. So it was a combination of Congress plus the State
                    Department who basically supported me.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: Correct. When I started in the OAS Tom Enders was the Assistant Secretary
                    for Latin American Affairs and he knew me also. Then came Tony Martinez who saw
                    how I operated at the State Department and he did not object. I don't know if I
                    was his prime candidate, probably not because he told me personally afterwards,
                    “Alberto you have my total support now that you have been appointed Ambassador.”
                    And I did get his support. I don't think there was any major opposition.
                    Senators Dodd and Pell backed me without any problems.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: I had absolutely no problem with the Foreign Relations Committee. It was
                    unanimous.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if you could explain a little about Senator Jesse
                        Helms of North Carolina because he plays a fairly strong role in our Latin
                        American policy at that time? Not only Senator Helms but as you mentioned
                        you knew some of his staff members. It was almost as if Senator Helms had,
                        and maybe still has, his own sort of Central American foreign policy. He
                        feels very strongly about this although he doesn't come from a particularly
                        Spanish-oriented state.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: He did have his own staff which was interested in Latin America, but I
                    don't think this was true of only Senator Helms. Afterwards I operated with
                    other Senators as well. For example, Senator Dodd from Connecticut became a very
                    good friend of mine and came several times to Guatemala and stayed with me. He
                    also had a staff that was very interested in Latin America at that time. The
                    other Senator who came very often was Kerry from Massachusetts. In fact, when I
                    left Guatemala, which is ironic, I came in with the most conservative, if you
                    want to use the term, in the Senate and I left with the compliments of one of
                    the most liberal in the Senate which are Senators Dodd and Kerry. In fact,
                    Senator Kerry had inserted into the Congressional Record three or four pages in
                    which he quotes from the Foreign Minister of Guatemala and his own personal
                    experience in Guatemala saying that I was one of the best ambassadors he had
                    ever known. So I am very proud, I have to admit it. On the one hand, Senator
                    Helms was instrumental in my getting the position and on the other hand when I
                    left the greatest compliment given to me was one by Senator Kerry.</p>

                <p>PIEDRA: They have what they call an Ambassadorial Seminar which I think was a

                <p>PIEDRA: No. But it was useful. But, of course, in my case the usual questions of
                    security, how to handle one self for security purposes, etc....part of it was
                    the process of adaptation. I, being of Latin background, the process of
                    adaptation was very little or nothing. So there was really no problem. We
                    adapted almost the very instant we arrived. On the other hand, the other part of
                    it was interesting. The entire Ambassadorial Seminar, I think, is extremely
                    interesting. I think Tony Martinez gives them now.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: I have no complaints about the Embassy in Guatemala at all. From the day
                    I arrived I found support, people who were friendly. I found no antagonism even
                    though there is always the danger of it being a political appointee and having
                    been appointed by Senator Helms.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Particularly in the Foreign Service there was the
                        impression that Senator Helms and the people he would appoint would be
                        ideologues who would go in with a fairly extreme rightist point of
                        view.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: That is correct. That is why, I said it before, that I am proud in many
                    ways to say that when I left Guatemala the persons who gave me the greatest
                    compliment was Senator Kerry from Massachusetts and Senator Dodd.</p>

                <p>PIEDRA: As you know there was a military government in Guatemala when I arrived.
                    You ask me what were the main objectives? Primarily I would say to reestablish
                    free elections in a democratic process in Guatemala. Establish respect for human
                    rights in Guatemala was another priority. Unfortunately it is true that there
                    have been many violations of human rights in Guatemala. I mean that is a fact of
                    life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe how we defined human rights and what
                        were our concerns about human rights?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: Violation, for example, in this particular case in Guatemala of freedom,
                    not only the freedom of expression which is one of the basic things, but freedom
                    to be able to move around. To be able to participate in a democratic government
                    with free elections. To respect your neighbor and his property. All of these
                    things which were not the norm in Guatemala.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were kidnappings, killings, etc.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: Yes. And what the tragedy of Guatemala was, and that happened very often
                    in Central American unfortunately, was that you never knew who did it. There is
                    no doubt that in Guatemala violations were committed from both sides. It is not
                    a question of only the government committed all sorts of violations, and the
                    army in many ways, but the other side was also responsible for violations. So it
                    was a very complicated thing. It is true that the army very often from what we
                    heard committed all sorts of wrong doings.</p>
                <p>I do want to clarify one thing which I think should be clarified. When I arrived
                    in Guatemala the situation had improved already. Under the regime of Vitor the
                    situation began to improve. I honestly believe that during my stay in Guatemala
                    that the whole situation of human rights improved very significantly. I am not
                    trying to get credit for it...circumstances or whatever you want...but it was a
                    fact of life.</p>

                <p>PIEDRA: Development. As you know you can not have development if you don't have
                    stability. So therefore in order for you to have development the first thing you
                    must have is stability politically and otherwise because otherwise you cannot
                    invest, you cannot do anything. Our basic idea was to try to set the scenario so
                    that development could take place...investment could return to Guatemala. For
                    example, in Guatemala the flight of capital was horrendous. Many of the wealthy
                    were taking the money out and putting it in Miami, etc. Why were they doing
                    this? There were many factors. Maybe some people were doing it because of greed,
                    others were doing it for other reasons. But there was no doubt that many people
                    honestly did it because they felt unsafe in Guatemala. So therefore they thought
                    it was better for them to have their money out. Therefore, if you want all that
                    money back, the first thing you have to do is get stability in the country. If
                    you don't have that stability it is very difficult to convince anybody to put
                    their money there. I think this is one of the main reason apart from the human
                    aspects of it that we were so much interested in getting political stability in
                    the country and at the same time improve the human rights situation, possibly
                    eliminate completely all violations, and try to convince people that Guatemala
                    had the human and material resources to be developed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the stories is that our main concern in Central
                        America is promoting American business exploitive relationships. You think
                        of the American Fruit Company and all that. I wonder if you could talk about
                        our commercial interests in the region.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: Obviously we do have commercial interests, but I honestly think that we
                    cannot talk about the exploitation of American business in Latin America today.
                    You may have talked about these things 30 or 40 years ago. I am not denying that
                    big companies did some things that were probably not correct ones. I don't want
                    to get involved in that because that is something of the past. We ought to talk
                    about the bad things but we never talk about the good things that they left in
                    terms of communications and so forth. I don't want to get involved in that.</p>
                <p>But to talk about exploitation right now in Guatemala specifically, I don't think
                    that is correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to get a feel for this, as American Ambassador,
                        American commercial development outside of doing it for development
                        purposes, I mean, really didn't even cross your radar practically. Did it?
                        To help American business wasn't a major priority.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: We did try to foster foreign investments and American in general because
                    it would help the economy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The thrust of the Ambassador was to develop the economy of
                        the country...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>PIEDRA: To try to help them develop. It is not our role to develop the economy of
                    Guatemala. Our role is to try to help them. To try to make it easier for them to
                    develop themselves. AID and foreign aid was given to try to help them to
                    develop...give them the technology and knowhow. They do need assistance. Very
                    often they do not have the knowhow and knowledge. From that point of view AID
                    did a very good job while I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if you could give a little idea of what the
                        situation, political and economic, was internally in Guatemala when you
                        arrived there in 1984?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: I honestly believe that there was a very significant improvement, even
                    from the political point of view and I will tell you why. I honestly believe
                    thaVitor really wanted the country to go back to democracy. If he had not wanted
                    it, he could have avoided it at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long had he been in power?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: Not very long.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But there had been a military...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: Remember he took over from another general.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we are talking about a succession of military
                        governments for some time and you came when there was a very significant
                        change.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: That's right. I talked to him many, many times. In fact, when I left the
                    country he was no longer president, having been replaced by a Christian Democrat
                    who was freely elected. I took the time to go to his home...he lived in a small
                    apartment in Guatemala...I wanted to go and say goodby and thank him for being
                    instrumental in bringing back democracy. I really believe that in spite of other
                    faults he may have had he really believed that the country had to go back to
                    some type of democracy. And he should be given credit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The election was when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: It must have been in November, 1983.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>PIEDRA: Yes. He took office in December, one month later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had the United States played any role by offering more
                        aid, etc. in exchange for democracy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: No, we didn't make any conditions at all as far as I can remember. I
                    never said, “either you do it or else.” We just told them point blank that if a
                    coup or junta took place we would take it very negatively. We showed strongly
                    our interests in democracy and human rights and it was obvious to them, but it
                    was not specific with strings attached.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mention in human rights that it came through
                        kidnappings, killings, threats and terrorists were coming from the right,
                        left and all, but who was on the right and who was on the left?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: It was very difficult to tell. You see they had four revolutionary
                    movements so you could tell more or less, but not specifically who were their
                    representatives let's say in Guatemala City. For example, I used to go to
                    Guatemala quite a lot before I became Ambassador. I remember one day in
                    Guatemala City — Guatemala City was a dead city. The restaurants were empty. You
                    couldn't see people on the streets. You put on the television and all of a
                    sudden the program would be interrupted and it would say the rebels, or whatever
                    you want to call them, declared a state of seize, blah, blah, blah. In other
                    words it was a situation which was really dramatic. And of course shootings were
                    going on and it was a total disaster.</p>
                <p>When I arrived and Majea Victor took over the situation improved very
                    significantly. People were beginning to think that maybe he really wanted the
                    country to come back to a democracy. Restaurants began to open again and there
                    were people on the streets, etc. When the elections took place it was like the
                    Fourth of July.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me, why did Guatemala go this way and El Salvador has
                        remained until at least yesterday a major area of contention with the
                        Nicaragua Sandinistas stirring up a lot of trouble?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>PIEDRA: I think there are several differences. First of all I think you cannot
                    compare the Guatemalan army with the Salvadoran army. You can say whatever you
                    want about the Guatemalan army, but they do have esprit de corps, they have a
                    high morale, at least among the officers. I don't think you find that in the
                    Salvadoran army. The Guatemalan army, and I am not justifying it, I think it is
                    terrible, did wipe out the guerrilla movement. El Salvador never did that. Why,
                    I don't know. Maybe because they were so corrupt. So in Guatemala from that
                    point of view there is a significant difference. I am not saying this was
                    justified. The ends do not justify the means. But they did act in such a way
                    that the guerrilla movement ...don't forget that you couldn't go from Guatemala
                    City to Antigua. The guerrillas would interfere along the main roads. In other
                    words, it was a situation in which they occupied large portions of the country.
                    The army was able to liquidate most of the guerrillas with tactics that...I want
                    to repeat a hundred times that you and I would not agree with. Therefore when
                    Majea Vitor came to power the country was in a totally different situation then
                    it was before. So from that point of view there was greater stability in the
                    sense that there were not guerrillas threatening to occupy cities, etc. as there
                    was previously.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Honduras was not an area where we were as concerned about
                        as we were with El Salvador. Were the Nicaraguans trying to do anything
                        there or were they...we are talking about the Sandinistas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: Yes, they did. But you see by the time I got there the guerrillas were
                    concentrated in the remote areas of the country so they did not constitute a
                    threat to the major cities, communications, etc. They were more or less in
                    isolated regions. But there were three or four areas in the country where they
                    were operating. But they did not constitute such a burden to the cities. You
                    could roam around Guatemala City with no problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have to worry about your security? Could you talk
                        about what it is like being an Ambassador...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: That's another story. It was two different things. We are talking now of
                    guerrillas. The political aspect of it. The threat almost disappeared in the
                    cities but it existed in the mountains, etc. That is correct.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>Now, common criminality. That, unfortunately, began to increase. You are asking
                    why? There are different versions and different theories concerning that. But
                    the fact still remains that from the point of view of common criminality it
                    began to get worse and worse. Some people claim it is because the economic
                    situation deteriorated at the beginning. I don't know if you can give credence
                    to that or not because in reality it is true that it deteriorated in terms of
                    the consequence but on the other hand it also improved because better economic
                    measures were taken. Another reason and it may be more correct, I don't know,
                    was that many of the old policemen were kicked out. There was a clean up. Many
                    claim that many of these people who were before involved had the arms, etc. and
                    became common criminals. Perhaps a weaker democratic government played a role as
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did this mean for being an American Ambassador
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: From our point of view and in all honesty I never felt fearful at all. We
                    had very good security. Sometimes you wondered if we had too much security.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some years ago we had an Ambassador killed there, John
                        Gordon Mein.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: Correct. I have to admit that I never felt in any way insecure although
                    we had a lot of security at the Embassy. Personally I had two American
                    bodyguards all the time next to me, plus about 10 Guatemalans. You know,
                    advanced cars, etc. There was always the danger that something could happen, but
                    as long as I was there nothing happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the main issues that you dealt with with the
                        government? Were there any crises? Our Central American policy was at the
                        foremost of our foreign policy during this time. Was Guatemala somewhat
                        removed from this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: Yes, Guatemala does not have a border with Nicaragua so from that point
                    of view we were fortunate to be a little bit removed from that situation. We
                    were, obviously, the stepping stone because we had a lot of Congressional
                    Delegations. They were continuously coming. They would call one day and say that
                    Senator so-and-so was coming on a tour of Central American and planned to stop
                    over in Guatemala and wanted to see the President, the Foreign Minister, the
                    Minister of Defense, etc. They would go from Guatemala to Nicaragua or Honduras.
                    So we had a constant flow of people coming in and out. Now we in Guatemala,
                    thank God, we were not involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because it came out later that there were an awful lot of
                        things going on...part of it became known as the Iran-Contra Affair...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>PIEDRA: We were not involved at all. As far as my knowledge is concerned we were
                    not involved in the whole question of the Iran-Contra affair.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you didn't feel pressure, let's say, from the
                        National Security Council or from the Desk to do something about this or
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: No. Because to avoid any possibility of people claiming to have
                    instructions for the Embassy, the first thing I did was to say that any
                    instruction that I receive at the Embassy had to come directly from the
                    President through George Shultz, the Secretary of State, and Tony Martinez. I
                    didn't care whether an instruction came from the NSC, the CIA, DOD, etc. (I
                    repeat, none did), I wouldn't have accepted it. They would have had to send it
                    through the Department of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was very much a freewheeling time for that area where
                        you had the NSC doing things that nobody else knew about and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: I can assure you that as long as I was in Guatemala, nothing, unless I
                    don't know about it, like that happened. I was very, very clear about this and
                    everybody knew it. I remember I told George Shultz and Tony Martinez. I also
                    discussed it with Elliott Abrams.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From a policy consideration I would think there would be a
                        sort of “Thank God, Guatemala is not a major problem.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: Wait a minute, I want to clarify. It is not a major problem, but it could
                    be. Don't forget Guatemala is the number one country in Central America.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: In terms of resources, in terms of everything. Guatemala is the most
                    advanced country. Guatemala City is the Paris of Central America, if you want to
                    use the term. Guatemala has a very dynamic private sector, a very sophisticated
                    one in fact. It is the most advanced in may ways of them all. So it is key. Now,
                    fortunately for us it was not directly involved in all of these things.
                    Indirectly, yes, because don't forget the guerrillas in Guatemala were backed by
                    the Sandinistas and by Cuba.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In looking up before this interview, there were problems
                        when the new freely elected president came in, Serrano. He was working to
                        institute land reforms, tax reforms, etc. but was backing off because he was
                        really concerned about going too far because of the army. Was there an
                        uneasy relationship or was that exaggerated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: I don't really know. One of the things that Serrano did that some people
                    criticize and some don't, was that he managed to win over the army. Now whether
                    there was a quid pro quo there I really don't know. But everybody thought that
                    the main opposition would be from the army. The army was always very suspicious
                    of Serrano because he was much more leftist leaning and they were always fearful
                    that he might turn towards Castro. Now the private sector was not in favor of
                    him for the same reason. So when he came to power, people were anxious as to how
                    he was going to react. For whatever reason, Serrano did not turn in that
                    direction. He played both cards but he did not take a very leftist turn as many
                    people expected. On the contrary, in many ways he maintained very good relations
                    with the army, at least on the surface. Obviously there were some colonels who
                    probably were not very happy for whatever reasons. He backed certain sections of
                    the army and not others so there might have been some malcontents. But in all
                    appearance things were calm in general.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you as the Ambassador and by extension the
                        United States government doing to help the situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: Well, don't forget that I was there only during the first 8 months of the
                    Serrano regime. In the first 8 months, apart from the mentioned fears in certain
                    sectors, as the months developed many of these fears declined. However, after I
                    left, the thing started to deteriorate. By the time we left...you saw the
                    results in the election. Serrano lost in a miserable way because people became
                    frustrated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it was still an election.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: Oh, yes. Serrano is a firm believer in democracy. I am sure of that. But
                    in terms of his government, people were disillusioned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have an AID program going in Guatemala?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: We did have one. I don't know how exactly it is operating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking about the time you were there. What was the
                        main thrust?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>PIEDRA: Basically, as I said before, it was very much directed towards the
                    agricultural sector. We did water projects, showed farmers new techniques in how
                    to grow things, etc. AID was performing a very good job in many ways.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There has been a major influx of immigration from Central
                        American countries and Guatemala is one of them. Guatemalans, among others,
                        were seeking asylum in the United States. There wasn't the guerrilla war
                        going on as in El Salvador but they were claiming sanctuary in churches,
                        etc. What was the feeling at the Embassy towards this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: You can not generalize. I am sure that some people in reality felt
                    threatened. But on the other hand I also think that some people...very often you
                    want to come to the United States and there are different ways of coming. To
                    come to the United States sometimes is not very easy. Now the only way you can
                    do it is by saying that you are a political refugee. I am not going to say that
                    this was the normal thing. But in certain cases I think these two things can
                    overlap.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was in Yugoslavia for five years. Yet there were people
                        who left Yugoslavia claiming refugee status and actually they were really
                        what you call an economic refugee.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: Yes, that is what I am trying to say. However, sometimes it is difficult
                    to distinguish between the political and economic refugee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have problems with members of the Catholic Church
                        from the States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: No. They would sometimes come with complaints about human rights and we
                    would try to investigate it but they never created any problems for us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's say you get a complaint about human rights.
                        After all one could say that if a policeman beats up a minority in Los
                        Angeles, the Guatemalan Ambassador in Washington isn't going to send out
                        someone to investigate. But what were we doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: We would if it were an American citizen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But what if it wasn't an American citizen? You would get a
                        report saying that there had been a killing in such and such a place; this
                        would get in the papers; and then they would say what about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>PIEDRA: Well, first of all we would try to find out the facts as they
                    were...sometimes, as you know, these things are difficult. If there is something
                    that is legitimate and we think it of serious consequences we would go to the
                    Foreign Minister, or whoever it was, first and go through the proper channels.
                    If necessary we would take it to the very top and say, “We are very concerned
                    because we hear this is going on, and as you know we are opposed to any
                    violations of human rights. We do not believe this is a question of getting
                    involved with internal affairs, it is just a question of justice or
                    humanitarianism.”</p>
                <p>For example, if we knew of a sudden kidnaping of somebody...one case when I was
                    there had to do with trade unions. I went in to see the Foreign Minister and
                    said, “This is terrible, how could it happen? Can you imagine the impact this
                    will have abroad if something happens to this person?”</p>
                <p>If they got the message they would try to solve the problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it that there was understanding on the Guatemalan
                        side of the government that when we made these protests it was not just
                        meddling.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: It all depends on how you say these things. If you go there pounding on
                    the table, that is ridiculous. But if you go and say, “Look, Emanuel, we just
                    found out this. How could this be possible now that Guatemala is going on the
                    right track? Now that Guatemala is doing the right thing. Now that the prestige
                    of Guatemala is coming back after so many years of being considered the worse.
                    Can't you investigate to see what is happening? I am sure you are not behind
                    it.” And let them do the rest. They know we are concerned. They know that we
                    know about these things and we are putting it in general terms of “Hey, do
                    this!” You don't say that, but they get the message.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it that within that society you worked very hard to
                        be on a first name basis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: Yes. That is why I have always maintained that if you want to be a good
                    diplomat the first thing you have to do is cultivate human relations. Because it
                    is much easier for you to operate once you have this good personal relationship
                    at the very beginning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Cuba? Did Cuba Embassy play much of a
                        role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: There was no Cuban Embassy in Guatemala.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Soviets?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>PIEDRA: They don't have an embassy either. You see Guatemala did not have
                    diplomatic relations with the Soviet countries at all. They didn't have any
                    communist country in Guatemala at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Mexico?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: Relations were not very good. Guatemala vis-a-vis Mexico is similar to
                    what it used to be between Mexico and the United States. Because, don't forget,
                    according to the Guatemalans the whole Chiapas region was originally Guatemala
                    and the Mexicans took it away from them. So therefore there is the feeling of
                    big brother on top who has abused Guatemala.</p>
                <p>Now, by the way, it is to the credit of the Guatemalan government that it
                    established good relations with the Mexican government. There were many
                    implications of all this because it had to do with the whole question of
                    guerrillas coming into Guatemala from Mexico. The guerrillas are according to
                    Guatemalan sources, very often going into Mexico, staying there a while and then
                    come back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we stay out of the problems between Mexico and
                        Guatemala?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: We didn't get involved because it wasn't that serious. I mean, it wasn't
                    a question about war. It was just a sort of antagonism for historical reasons
                    which was reflected now because of the suspicion that Mexico was protecting the
                    guerrillas. The Mexican government, of course, has denied this saying that they
                    can't patrol the border. Whatever the reason, the Guatemalans interpreted this
                    as a sort of protection that the Mexican government was giving at the time to
                    allow the guerrillas to linger there, etc. Therefore when there were some
                    incidents...as you know there were some refugee camps which, after meetings,
                    were pulled back a certain number of miles to avoid this problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about with Belize?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: That is a very touchy problem. But from what I have heard Savana [ph] now
                    is going to change the whole thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Guatemala had a claim there. Was this something that we
                        got involved in or sort of left it to the British?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>PIEDRA: We did and we didn't. We did in the sense that we wanted a peaceful
                    solution. So from that point of view, yes. We did not get involved directly
                    because it was a problem between Britain and Guatemala directly and had nothing
                    to do with us. But, of course, we would not like a conflict there or a problem
                    so we were always sympathetic to any kind of agreement which had been reached
                    between both countries. Guatemala right now realizes that there is no
                    possibility of their recovering Belize as part of Guatemala. But I do think they
                    want rights towards the sea, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you and your Embassy get involved in the various
                        peacekeeping efforts...El Salvador business dominated everything, the
                        guerrilla war there. We were getting involved militarily, at least through
                        assistance. Mexico and Venezuela and other Central American governments were
                        in the Contradora...Was Guatemala involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: Well, yes they were involved. It was not a problem, but that is where
                    diplomacy came in. Where did Guatemala stand in all this? Mexico wanted
                    Guatemala always to be basically on their side. So from that point of view we
                    were directly involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am sure you were getting cables all the time with
                        instructions essentially to tell the Guatemalans this was how we wanted to
                        see things and all. This is done to every post. On the Contradora position
                        did you find the Guatemalans receptive, understanding of our concerns?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: I would say they were receptive. But the question here is that Guatemala
                    wanted to follow a sort of independent, sort of neutral policy. We would have
                    liked Guatemala to take more of a pro-US position in the whole Contradora
                    process. Guatemala didn't want to antagonize either the US or Mexico so they
                    took sort of a neutralist policy.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: No, they were not against us. Sometimes they took actions that we would
                    not have liked them to take.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any other major problems that I haven't touched

                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>PIEDRA: Guatemala was not directly involved in the Sandinista problem. I am glad
                    you mentioned the Contradora because, of course, that was an important issue
                    that for a time did play a significant role, especially when we had the roving
                    ambassadors. First we had Shlaudeman and then Philip Habib. They came to
                    Guatemala a lot to keep in touch with the position of Guatemala vis-a-vis
                    Nicaragua. But it was all on a diplomatic level. It was never on any other level
                    except the diplomatic level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression, you were on first name basis
                        with many of the leaders there and all, of what was happening in Nicaragua
                        with the Sandinistas, etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: Well, privately, they were against the Sandinistas in general. But
                    publicly they played it neutral. You see, one of the problems is that they were
                    never sure of our attitude in the long run. In other words, they were never sure
                    whether one day we would drop the Contras. They were not absolutely convinced
                    that if they took our side...if we ever dropped the Contras and the Sandinistas
                    were the ones who ruled, then they would find themselves in a very difficult
                    position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A lot of Americans...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: They kept reminding me of what happened in Vietnam. And that is why they
                    played this neutral attitude.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the media? How did you find the press within
                        Guatemala, and did you also get American reporters coming looking for horror
                        stories? Was media a problem at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: I have to admit that as long as I was Ambassador in Guatemala we had no
                    problem with the media except one case. Our security had decided that we should
                    improve our security system around the Embassy in Guatemala and we had to close
                    one of the streets, etc. That was used by one of the newspapers as a pretext to
                    attack the Embassy for our policy in general. Saying that this is once again a
                    demonstration of American imperialism, blah, blah, blah, and they think they can
                    control everything, etc.</p>
                <p>My personal opinion was that the attack was not so much an attack on us as it was
                    a way to attack the mayor of Guatemala City whose rival in the mayoral elections
                    had been the head of the newspaper involved. The mayor, of course, was the one
                    who gave us authorization to do things. I think in order to hit the mayor he
                    used us.</p>
                <p>In terms of foreign correspondence who came, yes, sometimes they tried to...but I
                    generally would say no. Even 60 Minutes interviewed me for half an hour, but
                    used only 2 minutes.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 60 Minutes is sort of a muckraking TV show in which, if
                        you appear on it, you are usually going to appear looking awful.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: They were asking me about human rights. I said to myself, “I bet you
                    anything they are going to ask me and I am going to say the situation improved,
                    etc., and right after that they will show somebody lying dead in the street.”
                    They did do that, but they didn't do it right after I spoke. With me personally,
                    they didn't embarrass me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any problem with drug smuggling or anything else
                        at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: Towards the end of my tour the drug problem began. There were rumors and
                    talk, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this was not on your priority list?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: It was beginning but at that time not a major problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you left in ...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: August, 1987 and then I was appointed to the United Nations with Dick
                    Walters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: I went as Special Advisor to the General Assembly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you major concerns?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: I was dealing with the Ambassadors and so forth at the United Nations on
                    Latin American affairs specifically. The basic idea was to get in touch with all
                    the Latin Ambassadors, most of whom I knew, and see how they would vote in the
                    General Assembly. It was sort of a lobbying operation. I would go back to
                    Walters and say that this guy or that guy thinks this way or that way. That sort
                    of thing.</p>
                <p>This lasted for three months and then I was sent to Europe to the Human Rights
                    Commission in Geneva. I spent another three months commuting between Washington
                    and Geneva.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>After that I was appointed as a deputy for the Economic and Social Council,
                    another conference in Geneva.</p>
                <p>So I stayed at the UN with Walters until August, 1988.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A full year.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: Yes, a full year. It was very interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the UN?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PIEDRA: After being at the OAS...the OAS seemed like a family reunion where you
                    know everybody by their first name. The UN is totally different. It is not as
                    personal. In my case I dealt primarily with Latin America so I had a more
                    personal relationship, but in general it was much more impersonal. But it was
                    interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to thank you very much. This has been
                        fascinating.</hi>
