                <p>MARGARET WHITE BENNETT</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Jewell Fenzi</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: November 21, 1988</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Jewell Fenzi on Monday, November 21st, 1988, I'm
                        interviewing Margaret White Bennett, Mrs. Tapley Bennett at my home, in
                        Washington, DC.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>I think I would like to start with something that you said downstairs a few
                    minutes ago, that the 1924 Rogers Act . . .</p>
                <p>BENNETT: Now remember that at that time, I was only two, so I was not very much
                    aware of what was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But your mother said your father highly approved of the
                        Rogers Act and the combining of the services, he thought it was a good idea,
                        and then you said that Wristonization was the thing that made the greatest
                        difference in our lives - perhaps not your life and my life, but in the life
                        of the Foreign Service in general and could we expand on that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Well, I think you've got these periodic reorganizations, both of the
                    Service and of the Department, and every time they reorganize, they seem to put
                    another layer in between the bottom and the top. You've had your deputy
                    assistant secretaries of State - I remember when an assistant secretary of State
                    was practically God and now, Good Lord. (laughter) There are so many people
                    before he's anywhere. I mean, you've got your Senior Executive Service, I do not
                    see how that's supposed to stimulate people to come into the Foreign Service,
                    but apparently they haven't really thought through what that implies for
                    themselves and their children's college education. I don't really understand it
                    and since we were getting out, I was very happy not to have to worry about it,
                    but I see it affecting some of my younger friends enormously. But the
                    Wristonization broadened the Service, I think in a quite desirable way, but of
                    course like any plan that's been put on paper, it caused a great deal of
                    heartache for a lot of people who might otherwise never have been bothered
                    because they were happily ensconced in the Department doing a very good job in
                    the Department. But just because they were being splendid at the, say, Deputy
                    Director of East African Affairs, didn't necessarily mean that they'd be a whiz
                    in Mombasa, especially very hard on their wives.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they were primarily, weren't they, upper level Civil
                        Service who were a bit older, their children were in high school or college
                        or that age, a hard time for a family to move.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Well, I think they were the ones that it was harder on. The younger ones
                    were perhaps more adaptable, maybe not. But that sort of thing is not entirely
                    limited to the Foreign Service. I remember talking to the Vice President of
                    Grace Company when my father was in Peru. We'd gone up to see a cardboard
                    factory - the bagasse from sugar cane - and Talara was not exactly the world's
                    greatest metropolis and he said that they used to try and vet their candidates
                    very carefully, they'd show them films, they'd have a wife come in, they'd talk
                    to her and they'd tell her how ghastly it would be, but all in all they both
                    wanted to go. And then they got them down there and the wife would go to buy
                    some meat and be confronted by the raw carcass hanging covered with flies and
                    immediately want to go home, and this sort of obvious culture shock I think is
                    something that you get in every walk of life, but it perhaps hit some of the
                    Wristonees harder because they thought they knew about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't think today the Foreign Service goes to the wife
                        of a potential junior officer and tells her what it's going to be like. I
                        don't think they have any contact with her before he comes into the
                        Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: No, and I don't believe that even when you get in for ambassadorial
                    wives' orientation that they get too much of a description of what daily life
                    might be like, but then of course a lot has to do with what your financial
                    situation is and also your own mental make-up. Because I think people are very
                    fortunate, who like to paint, and that they can transport everywhere so that no
                    matter how frustrated or how unhappy they are in the beginning, they can always
                    work it off by painting assuming they can make the time to do it.</p>
                <p>I think in the old days, before 1972, we had a better time of it as an incoming
                    wife because it was an understood thing that the section chief's wife would see
                    to it that somebody met you and had something in the fridge for you, invited
                    you, took you around shopping, helped you go pay calls. I do not lament the
                    demise of paying calls excepting for the opportunity it offered to find out a
                    little more about where you were if you were bright enough to remember to ask.
                    And it also was a much better way of being able to get to know somebody,
                    certainly from the ambassador's wife's standpoint.</p>
                <p>Of course I remember in the Dominican Republic after the revolution, the embassy
                    began being beefed up to where we were fifteen people short of the largest
                    embassy in the hemisphere - I think Brazil was larger than we were - but they
                    poured in AID and people like that and I was finding that I was receiving three
                    and four ladies almost everyday. And I didn't like receiving three and four at a
                    time because I got a mental picture about how Mrs. Jones would look and how Mrs.
                    Smith would look and the one I would visualize as Mrs. Smith turned out to be
                    Mrs. Jones and I never did get them straight (laughter). One shouldn't make
                    previous images I guess.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>I used to wonder about this business of good works because I didn't feel that the
                    Dominican Republic was a country where we should be doing good works for the
                    benefit of U.S. personnel. I was rather shocked to learn that the embassy, for
                    instance in Tehran, seemed to be putting on benefits, half of which came back to
                    the Foreign Service Wives' Association and I don't knock the cause, but I just
                    sort of wondered whether when you're in one of these countries of appalling
                    misery, why I don't think one has a right to take stuff out, but each to his
                    own. I never really felt very strongly about having projects. Helping feed and
                    nurse babies in the children's hospital in Santo Domingo was my project in the
                    embassy. It was something that could be dropped without leaving a great hole. I
                    thought it was a good thing to have something to pull the wives together, but,
                    of course in those days we all expected to do something. Nowadays if you don't
                    know how to go about finding your way, it must be pretty grim.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you go about pulling wives together after 1972?
                        What was your modus operandi?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: At that time Tap was the career senior man at the U.N. and New York was
                    a place that, well, I don't know anybody who can't find something to enjoy in
                    New York and I think everybody, foreigners and we all enjoyed it because it was
                    a place we could all be relatively anonymous. We weren't in the goldfish bowl
                    the way you are in any other, well certainly bilateral assignment.</p>
                <p>I didn't pull the wives together. There was the U.N. Delegates' Wives' Club and I
                    worked my head off for that eventually, but we'd try and have the new couple in
                    for a drink when they arrived and I'd try and tell them, “Now don't be worried
                    if your husband's out until 2 a.m. He's really not off with a blonde. He's
                    really working,” (laughs) and so forth. But that was a very hard job on families
                    because most of the people with children, because of schooling, had to live
                    outside of the city which meant a tremendous commute for their husbands. And
                    then they had these ghastly hours, especially during the Assembly time, and it
                    placed tremendous strains on people who couldn't live in Manhattan. And it
                    wasn't all that easy if you lived in Manhattan. I mean if you did live in
                    Manhattan, and you didn't have children, you could go down and sit in the
                    visitors' gallery at the Security Council meetings or the Assembly meetings. But
                    then they'd have to go over and write cables and telegrams or what have you and
                    you were still stuck there at 3 in the morning with no husband, probably no
                    means of getting home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So really an assignment like that — with or without
                        children would make a big difference in your attitude toward it, I would
                        think.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>BENNETT: Well of course. I'm a very poor person to interview in one sense because
                    my career - I don't suppose there's anything such as a typical Foreign Service
                    career, but there are some that are more so than others and mine certainly
                    didn't fall into the norm because first of all, we had lovely assignments. We
                    were so lucky and I mean the only assignment that was awkward in the English
                    sense was the Dominican Republic because that blew up and we had a revolution
                    during it. But even that had its pluses and certainly was not an unpleasant
                    place to live, and we had healthy places, we had places where there were
                    enormous cultural - culturally interesting places, and so I feel that we were so
                    fortunate and we were not moved all that frequently so that I don't feel that my
                    service was at all typical.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me say that, in all my interviewing, I haven't found
                        the typical Foreign Service wife because every interview is different and
                        every interview takes on a life of its own, and it's extraordinary how
                        diversified we are and how different [our] experiences have been. About the
                        only thing we have in common is that we were married and that we married
                        Foreign Service officers and that we moved around the world and it is
                        extraordinary how varied our attitudes and our experiences were. So, yes,
                        I'm very interested in talking to you. (laughter).</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Another thing you said before we started chatting was the big difference after
                    the 1972 Directive [The 1972 Policy on Wives of Employees of the Department of
                    State, the United States Information Agency and the Agency for International
                    Development. Usually referred to as the “72 Directive”, the Policy declared that
                    wives were private individuals with no obligation to engage in volunteer
                    activities for the Department of State], and that is the focal point of our
                    project. We're dividing the Foreign Service as old and new, based on the 1972
                    Directive.</p>
                <p>BENNETT: Yes, as a senior wife I was not unduly affected by the 1972 business
                    excepting in so far as that when it came the U.S. turn to give the tea at the
                    U.N. Delegates' Wives' Club, I couldn't call on volunteers. And actually most of
                    it I was able to do on my own, but finally, when it came to producing food, it
                    was supposed to be home-cooked and obviously I wasn't going to spend six weeks
                    preparing for hordes of women's teas and they expected a large meal practically
                    at those teas, so I asked Mrs. Scranton, who was the wife of the perm rep at the
                    time, if at a lunch she was giving I could ask if there was anybody who would be
                    willing to volunteer.</p>
                <p>And so I got up and made my little spiel and I got maybe three people who thought
                    they could be of assistance and, as it turned out, it was the wife of our air
                    attach� who took over the project with great enthusiasm in the beginning and did
                    a marvelous job. And so afterward I patted her on the back and I told her how
                    wonderful she was and would she please put down a record of what she had done so
                    that we could leave this with somebody and maybe the next time this came around
                    they'd have something to go on and she said, “There's just one question I'd like
                    to know. When I was a junior wife, the senior wives all sat around and told us
                    what to do. Now that I'm a senior wife, where are those junior wives?”
                    (laughter)</p>

                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what year was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: This was, had to have been about the winter of '74 or '75. Maybe 5 or 6,
                    I'm not sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How large a group did you have at the U.N.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Oh, it was a sizable group. I really couldn't tell you because, as I
                    say, there wasn't any encouragement from the Department to try and get together
                    too much and one was too busy in New York. As I say, it was one of those places
                    where there was so much you could do that you were frantically trying to enjoy
                    New York as much as possible while you were there.</p>
                <p>

                        interesting thing I remember from it is that that is the easiest place in

                <p>BENNETT: Yes, well we had a number of young couples come in and there again, it's
                    been interesting because I think two of them split up, not as a result of New
                    York, but as a result of the next post which didn't allow her to express
                    herself, or something like that, sufficiently.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: We had a middle grade officer who had an assignment in Washington for a
                    while and his wife had gotten a job with a law firm and she was very happy
                    there. Then they got assigned to NATO and this was at the time of the Forum
                    Report. [The Forum Report was drafted in 1977 by the Association of American
                    Foreign Service Women in response to a perceived break down in community
                    relations at US missions abroad as a result of the 72 Directive. The Report
                    resulted in the establishment of the Family Liaison Office (FLO) at the
                    Department in 1978.]</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '76?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Well, we didn't get to NATO until '77 so that it would have been a
                    little bit later, but somehow that Forum Report didn't make its way firmly on my
                    desk. I think it stayed in Tap's briefcase for a long time, not intentionally,
                    but just the nature of things, and so the about-to-be Director General Harry
                    Barnes was due to come through and Chris Glitman, who was the wife of our DCM at
                    the time, I'd said to her, she'd asked what could she do and I said, “You can
                    deal with wives, thank you, because I'm going to be traveling.” And she did a
                    superb job, but anyhow she felt that she ought to get the wives together to see
                    what they would like to have brought to the Director General's attention, and
                    she called up politely and said that she was having a coffee and did I want to
                    come. And I at first thought I shouldn't, but then I thought, no, it might be
                    interesting to hear what went on.</p>
                <p>Well, I'd expected the whole of NATO and then some to show up and instead of
                    which there were six of us. This middle grade wife was just as mad as hops
                    because the Department had promised to help her get her job, and as far as she
                    could see, nothing had happened. And then there was one wife whose first
                    language was French and who had done real estate in the States and she was
                    miffed because the embassy housing section had done such a lousy job on their
                    lease, and she felt that she ought to be in that housing section to deal with it
                    because she could be much more helpful, and she found that those jobs were
                    reserved for locals.</p>
                <p>Then we had another old-style wife who was feeling very much at loose ends
                    because there was nothing she could do as an embassy project and I wasn't about
                    to start one at that point. And then there was one brand-new wife who just - we
                    asked whether she had any comments about the greeting procedure and, by this
                    time we had CL[The Community Liaison Office has been established at most US
                    missions abroad. The Coordinator (CLO) is the Family Liaison Office
                    representative at post.] arrangements so they were supposed to take care of
                    this, and she felt that she had been left rather high and dry too, so I don't
                    know.</p>
                <p>But anyhow, there wasn't much input other than that for the Director General. And
                    I was interested, oh about three or four years later, by this time the CLO had
                    the three DCM wives in Brussels working very hard and there was much more
                    cohesion and I got the sense that maybe, just maybe, people would like to
                    reverse some of this not being asked to work bit, but of course they wanted
                    recognition for it. What '72 did to me personally was that it just made me feel
                    I was a non-person and therefore, if they didn't want me to work, by gum, they
                    weren't going to get their money's worth out of me which they had previously.
                    (laughs)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think our generation felt very much that way and we
                        continued to do things only for personal satisfaction and of course, if your
                        husband said, “Please, can't we have twenty-four people for dinner?” you
                        didn't say no.</hi>

                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>BENNETT: That we went along with automatically. I never understood this business
                    of wanting to be paid for entertaining people because if you were at home you'd
                    be inviting people, too. They'd be your husband's business associates or what
                    have you, and I just felt that whole premise is a completely false one.</p>
                <p>Of course, as one wife said to me when I was pointing out that really one had to
                    be able to ask wives to do things — If you were in some very small African post
                    and you got a CODEL (Congressional delegation) coming through, you wouldn't be
                    able to be there supervising the servants because you'd have to take either Mr.
                    Senator or Mrs. Senator around. And the wife looked at me crossly and said, “You
                    shouldn't have to do that.” Well, that's ignoring the verities as far as I'm
                    concerned. It would be more apt to happen in a very small post, but even in the
                    large posts, one dropped everything when . . .I remember in Portugal we had a
                    CODEL with Senator Sparkman who at that point was the Majority Leader of the
                    Senate, and Mrs. Sparkman, and they came with a plane load of people. And they
                    were only there, mercifully, for twenty-four hours, but they took up the entire
                    time of the whole embassy plus having to rent cars to look after them, and all
                    of us wives were showing them around this way and that and you might say it
                    wasn't necessary, but it certainly made the difference in the way those
                    particular people on the trip viewed the Department's activities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So those activities that were really an extension of your
                        husband's position - things that you would have been doing if you were home
                        anyway, you didn't object to.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: No, I didn't object to doing them and I did them, but what I was saying
                    was that what I objected to was the fact that one was no longer mentioned as
                    being part of the team.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Part of the team.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: One was a non-person.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever read one of your husband's efficiency reports
                        after this '72 directive?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>BENNETT: I didn't read them, no, but I remember he had a secretary, very
                    attractive, beautifully dressed black girl who came to work for him at the U.N.
                    and decided to go along with him wherever he next went and that happened to be
                    NATO and she was very good in the job and when our daughter got married, we had
                    the wedding in England, and of course asked the secretary to come. And Tap said
                    she was the best-dressed woman at the wedding, which was quite true. And so in
                    his efficiency report he was trying to give the all-around picture, and apart
                    from stating that she did a splendid job he also said that she was the
                    best-dressed woman at my daughter's wedding reception. And they said, “Mr.
                    Ambassador, you can't say that. You cannot make any personal remarks any more
                    even if they're laudatory.” And so this really bothered him because he didn't
                    mean it in the “sexist” way which so many people take so many of these
                    things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I did read one report because it was the year I thought
                        Guido should have been promoted. And it was the most astonishing experience.
                        I felt as if I had died, because I wasn't there! Only half of what he was
                        doing was represented there. And if your strength as an officer and as a
                        team was your relationship with the local community, that didn't necessarily
                        show.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Well, this is one of things that I keep worrying about because more and
                    more you get the business, particularly with the senior officers, where their
                    wife decides to pursue her own career. So she goes off and maybe she's there and
                    maybe she isn't, but she no longer technically is hostess or housekeeper or
                    whatever you want to call it. And the husband does have to do representation,
                    it's still part of the job, and it's still much better when it's done at home
                    than when you take people to a hotel.</p>
                <p>And I just don't know what this is going to do to what I call the “oil that
                    lubricates”, because most people still like to have a meal, even when discussing
                    business, and I don't think you're going to change that in most places. A lot of
                    the entertainment one does is probably unnecessary, but one should be able to
                    produce something in the way of a meal. Now some ambassadors get several
                    secretaries or housekeepers to run households for them, so that's not so bad,
                    but it's - I think it's, further down the line, at sort of the political
                    counselor level. I just wonder how this is going to work for them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't know. It would be interesting, and I don't know if
                        there's any way you could measure it except send a questionnaire out
                        (laughter) to everyone all over the world and say, “Is your perception of
                        America any different now than it was sixteen years ago. . .(laughter) when
                        the American wives were more active and took a more official role?” really,
                        because now the wife is officially unofficial, whereas before we were
                        unofficially official.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But now she just doesn't appear at all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: No. Of course another thing I do wish is that people, the fleet of
                    people who come from the Department, who come for meetings and so forth and land
                    as your house guests thereby saving their per diem - uh, would remember to just
                    write a thank-you note for hospitality, even if it was only the bed. It used to
                    be done and there's no reason why it shouldn't be done. You'd be surprised at
                    the number of people who fail to even say, “Thank you,” telephonically for
                    this.</p>
                <p>And I remember at NATO, it was Daniella Gardiner, Dick Gardiner's wife - he was
                    ambassador to Italy - and she finally got so outraged that her official visitors
                    wouldn't leave tips for the servants that she finally put a little card in the
                    guest room saying, “If you would like to express your thanks to those who made
                    your stay as pleasant as we could make it, we suggest so much a day per person.”
                    And I finally took that over, too, because we found otherwise that the household
                    didn't get anything. And half the time they'd be up at 2 a.m. trying to prepare
                    something for this character and . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Exactly. At first, I was tipping them myself for a few
                        months, in Brazil, and then I thought, I am not going to do this anymore.
                        And most people will say, “What can I do for you, can I take you to dinner
                        or something?” And there were very few places to go to dinner and so I'd
                        say, “No, let's just have supper here, but kindly leave something for the
                        staff before you leave.” And most of them did after they were asked, but not
                        before they were asked. (laughs). And that is shocking. That should be
                        understood.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Well, I think that gradually it is, but just because enough of us have
                    gotten annoyed about it. But I think this whole business of tipping - it was a
                    shock to me when we got to Vienna. Of course, I'd been brought up, when you
                    stayed with people, you left a tip after you'd been there for a night or two.
                    You left something for the household. But it never occurred to me that you were
                    supposed to leave a tip for a meal. I think it's something that's been wherever
                    the Hapsburgs have been, because certainly in Vienna, and of course the
                    Hapsburgs had been in Brussels, and they had been in Holland briefly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We used to do that in Holland.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: And anyway, I'd never hit it until we got to Vienna, and suddenly you
                    were expected to leave a tip when you picked up your coat. I thought it was an
                    insult to the host and hostess.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: My household - well, we ran an underground station for Yugoslavs and so
                    we had a Yugoslav butler and cook. But we had an Austrian cleaning woman. And
                    when we had outside help in, they of course always wanted it, so eventually we
                    obviously bowed to the inevitable and let it happen, but it just irritated me
                    so! (laughs)</p>

                <p>BENNETT: Oh that was rather fun. We arrived in Vienna in August with five
                    children and a collie dog. The five children ranged in age from 11 down to
                    four.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year is this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: This is 1957, two years after the state treaty had been signed and a
                    year after the Hungarian Revolution. Vienna was still recovering from occupation
                    and war and so forth so it was very rundown still. It was the only place I've
                    been where you could walk into a paper shop and buy one paperclip. I was sort of
                    accustomed to buying things in bulk. For instance, I remember going to a grocery
                    store and seeing a crate of oranges, and they said, “Oh gnaedige Frau, if you do
                    that we won't have any for our regular customers.” And then of course I had to
                    get used to the idea that I couldn't feel the bananas and I couldn't feel the
                    whatever it was, that it would have to be picked out for me. (laughs) All told I
                    had quite a lot of culture shock on housekeeping grounds.</p>
                <p>But anyway, we were in a pension for, oh, six weeks. We had a house assigned to
                    us but our predecessors were still there when we arrived and then it had to be
                    painted, and so we were in the pension. I don't know who was gladder to get out
                    of the pension, we to leave or they to have us leave because my young were
                    high-spirited, to put it politely. We'd had to go out the night we arrived and I
                    said, “You've got to find me a sitter.” Well, this frightened rabbit of a woman
                    turned up and she came two nights. Well, she couldn't do anything with the
                    children, but she was very good with the dog. (laughs)</p>
                <p>Well, then I kept looking for someone to cope with the young. In the meantime we
                    were also going to need a household and apparently staff were not plentiful in
                    Vienna, especially not good staff. The invasion of Filipinos hadn't arrived yet
                    and so one of the people in Personnel said they'd heard of a Yugoslav couple who
                    were in the, what's the word, not refugee camp, but it was - when people came
                    over from different countries, they would be put in the camp - internees, I
                    guess it is, camp in Traiskirchen and this was a Yugoslav couple and he had been
                    a driver for the U.S. Embassy. And he was a very fine man and she knew that the
                    wife was a fine woman and they had a niece and why didn't we try them?</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>So, in due course, Djura turned up on the doorstep and we interviewed him and
                    he's a very nice man and he spoke, well, more than broken English and he spoke
                    more than broken German, but it wasn't pluperfect by any manner of means. And he
                    said, yes, his wife could cook. She had never cooked as a paid job, but she
                    cooked for her large family and so forth. Anyway, we liked the looks of him. So
                    we took them on on faith. They were wonderful with the children and we all
                    adored them, but the niece was a total washout, but Djura managed to impose
                    discipline and so things went on pretty well.</p>
                <p>Our chief was Doc Matthews [H. Freeman Matthews was Ambassador to Austria
                    1957-62] who knew his wines and Tap wanted to make a good impression the first
                    dinner or lunch we gave which was for the Matthews, and so he asked me what we
                    were having. And so I apparently had ordered lamb and I don't know what,
                    something else. Well, I wrote out the menu for the first and last time in my
                    life, because when the meal appeared on the table, it bore no resemblance to
                    what was on the menu. (laughter) Tap was furious. He said, “I thought you told
                    me we were having such and such - whatever it was - and I picked the wines
                    accordingly.” And I said, “Look, that's what I ordered. Next time you just ask
                    Djura what we're having.” Because of course Djura had to decide, first of all,
                    was it available, and lamb was never available in Vienna, because the Viennese
                    look down on lamb and say it's an insult to serve them lamb which is something I
                    didn't know either. [On narrator's February 1989 visit to Vienna, lamb was to be
                    had on the menu at good restaurants.] No, that wasn't in the post report. And
                    then he had to decide what was available, he had to decide if she could cook it,
                    and then he had to decide if it was suitable for us to serve. So by the time
                    we'd gone through all three of those things, there wasn't much left. (laughter)
                    It was much easier letting him pick the menu. (laughter) But anyway, they got
                    their visas for the U.S. in due course and Djura said, “Now, Mr. Bennett, I'm
                    not going to leave you high and dry. I'm going to find you somebody to look
                    after you. Well, he wasn't able to get us a couple, but he got us a fine young
                    man whose surname was Radovich, who I think was the nephew of a former prime
                    minister and he'd been either a law student and then converted to medicine or
                    vice versa, but he was a very upper crust young man. So Tap had visions of
                    saying, “Radovich, bring me a drink.” But that was disposed of the first time we
                    saw him because the guy said, “Just call me Mike.” (laughter)</p>
                <p>And Mike came to us and Mike had a lot of friends who would come and the house
                    had a nice big basement with a couple of bathrooms in the basement for
                    household, and so Mike's friends would come and take baths in the basement.
                    Well, I never knew what went on in that basement, I carefully avoided asking.
                    Well, then Mike's turn to go to the U.S. came and he, too, was not going to
                    leave us high and dry so he produced Dan. Dan was an artist and he, I don't
                    think was politically a refugee, but he was just tired of being told how to
                    paint, and so he came out and he exhibited abroad, too, and made a little name
                    for himself at one of the Biennials or something like that.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>Anyway, he had lots of friends, including lady friends which upset the very nasty
                    gal we had who worked her way from charlady to cook. And she was a pain in the
                    anatomy, but she could cook. Every time I wanted to fire her, Tap would say,
                    “Have we got anybody in her place?” (laughs) And so we suffered. In fact, I
                    would really have enjoyed Vienna thoroughly if it hadn't been for her. But
                    anyway, there you were. Dan was quite an addition. His driving was something
                    else. We needed somebody to drive to take the children to and from school.</p>
                <p>He did monotypes, you know, you have a stone and then you put your color on a
                    stone and then you press the paper down on it so it's never quite the same twice
                    in a row. He would borrow, he would take a patch out of one of the children's
                    cast-off trousers and he would take a bit of Victoria's hair, and all of this
                    would go in, and some of his things were very nice indeed. Well, we discovered
                    that it would be rather fun to show some of these things. Well, he insisted that
                    the only way to look at them was off the floor, so after lunch, we would put
                    them on the floor of the living room, much to the astonishment of our Austrian
                    guests, and then people would start commenting on them. Well, Dan would be
                    passing the coffee and if somebody said something that he'd disapprove of, he'd
                    put down the coffee and tray and say, “No, no, no!” and then launch into this
                    dissertation. So we were rather unusual hosts in those days! (laughter)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wonderful American representatives, though really!
                        (laughter)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Well the best American representative in that embassy was a gal whose
                    name was Sally Kennedy and she was at the time a file clerk and she was mainline
                    Philadelphia, but anyhow, she was very friendly and outgoing and she met people
                    and so forth. Well, she with great courage, had decided to ask this lofty
                    creature, the political counselor to - because Vienna was very hierarchical and
                    I find that embassies take on the character of the host country and if it's a
                    hierarchical country, why then it's very, very, very stiff.</p>
                <p>So, anyhow, she asked us to dinner on a certain night and said, “Come after
                    eight,” which was slightly late by Vienna standards, that was all right. We
                    waited until 8 o'clock and the phone rang and it was Sally saying that she'd
                    managed to lock herself out of the apartment, but the locksmith was there, and
                    it should be about another hour, but not to bother coming until she called,
                    although she had been able to persuade her next-door-neighbor to take in
                    everybody. Well, she called and said we could come, so we finally turned up.</p>
                <p>Well, meantime, the poor next-door-neighbors didn't know what had hit them. They
                    had never met Sally. The husband worked on the autobahn in some sort of
                    engineering capacity and I don't know what Frau whatever-her-name-was did, but
                    Frau ended up cooking the dinner for Sally and being part of the party in that
                    we moved backwards and forwards between the two apartments.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>Well, Sally decided a few months later that she had skimmed the cream off of
                    Vienna and she would move on. So she had a farewell party. And she had at that
                    party everybody from Prince Fuerstenberg, a bluer blood you cannot find, down
                    to, I think, her charlady, even. And everybody thoroughly enjoyed this mix! But
                    very few people would have been able to do it, and certainly nobody else in that
                    echelon of the embassy even thought of entertaining that way. Sally was quite a
                    gal because she went on to France and she ended up working as a sort of
                    governess for some French politician. And they apparently had the third floor of
                    the apartment house and Sally's bedroom was in the garret. And I think there may
                    have been a loo up there, but I'm not even sure of that. But when she wanted to
                    take a bath, she was supposed to come down to the apartment, and after the five
                    little boys had bathed, then she could use their bath water. (laughter) We lost
                    track of her after that, and I'm very sorry because I think she was a great
                    loss.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She sounds like an interesting woman. When did you come
                        into the Service, about '53 or . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Well, what had happened was, Tap had joined the Service just in '41 and
                    then he tried desperately to join the Navy, but he is as blind as a bat and
                    despite getting a waiver from Admiral Leahy, FDR's physician, the Navy said,
                    “You still have the eyes,” and wouldn't take him. And so he served for three
                    years in the Dominican Republic and then went to Panama. We met between the
                    Dominican Republic and Panama, although he was in the Dominican Republic at the
                    time my parents were in Haiti and they had met him, but I hadn't. He discovered
                    when he got to Panama that that was one of the two places you could still enlist
                    at that time and not be drafted, so he was able to do a con job as far as the
                    eye test was concerned and was accepted for the Army.</p>
                <p>We actually got engaged at Panama when I was on my way down to meet my parents
                    for Christmas in Peru, and I was bumped from the plane from New York to Miami
                    and that bothered me. But the Miami to Panama plane had been delayed, so I was
                    able to make that after all. But in the meantime, I had missed the flight to
                    Peru. I was invited to stay at Ambassador Warren's - this was Avra Warren who
                    knew my parents through the Foreign Service, and so I stayed up there. And Tap
                    had been Warren's attach� in the Dominican Republic and in fact Warren had asked
                    for Tap to come along to Panama. So this was very nice. And so we announced our
                    engagement ten days later. And so I went on to Peru and by this time, he was
                    coming into Intelligence in Washington and he came up to the Pentagon.</p>
                <p>So we married in '45 and he stayed in the Army, oh had to stay in the Army, I
                    guess - I can't remember what year he got out - '47 or so. And then he went back
                    to the Department. And then we went abroad in '57, having had all five children
                    in Washington which was lucky, I think. I didn't have to travel with anybody
                    until Victoria was coming up four, which made quite a difference.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>And then we went to Vienna. He was political counselor there, and then we were
                    supposed to go to Rome from Vienna, but the two embassies had been fighting over
                    him as to when he would go, and eventually he went on the condition that he must
                    represent the Vienna embassy at some conference, and we got to Rome. And
                    Outer[bridge] Horsey was Charg� and had been Charg� for something like nine
                    months, and Tull(H.G.) Torbert had already left to go elsewhere, and so poor
                    Outer had been carrying the three top jobs singlehanded so ....</p>
                <p>End Tape I, Side ABegin Tape I, Side B</p>
                <p>. . . Tap was being transferred to Rome and so I was allowed to stay on in our
                    house in Vienna because our successor wasn't coming until the summer which meant
                    the children could finish the school year.</p>
                <p>But I went down to Rome with a compartment load of stuff that I'd packed with my
                    lily-white hands because the Department had suddenly gotten sticky about our
                    weight allowance. And Tap had already gone with another compartment load and
                    they took a small truck to take everything to the apartment. And it was one of
                    those Via Pinciana apartments, perfectly lovely. I wasn't quite sure how we were
                    going to fit into this place. The bathtub was the size of this room. (laughter)
                    And I'd forgotten to bring any flower vases and people had been kind and sent
                    some, so I had come back with some and I was feeling rather hot and stretched
                    out in this great long marble sarcophagus affair, and Tap suddenly burst in and
                    said, “It's a good thing you're lying down, because I've been transferred to
                    Greece and I'm to be there next week.” (laughter)</p>
                <p>And this was the day that the Horseys were giving a party to introduce us to the
                    Romans. Tap and Outer spent the whole party on the phone to Washington trying to
                    get this thing changed. I uttered more inanities about where I planned to send
                    my children to school. So then Tap managed to get a slight delay in going to
                    Greece because Queen Elizabeth was coming on a State Visit. He was like Dick
                    Whittington, he was bound and determined to see the Queen of England. And as it
                    happened Outer that night had some sort of intestinal flu or something, so Tap
                    was actually acting charg� which meant we got into the holy of holies and got to
                    see her.</p>
                <p>And then the next day we slunk out of town in the Fiat which we wouldn't have
                    bought if we'd known we were going to Greece. We had it packed with our best
                    silver in a foot locker in the back seat. Everybody was saying, “Oh, you mustn't
                    travel through Italy! Cars get broken into,” and so forth, but we put it in
                    parking lots, hotel garages. And then we got on the ferry, were met in
                    Patras.</p>
                <p>Neither of us in our wildest imaginations had ever expected to fetch up in Greece
                    and we really thought we liked green landscapes, so we were not really looking
                    forward to Greece at all. Well, just driving along the coast from Patras to
                    Corinth, the lovely golden tones of the hills against the blue, blue water, we
                    just fell in love with Greece, and up to the time we went to NATO, that was my
                    favorite posting.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>We hit it at a fantastic time because Sam Berger, who was the Charg� at the time,
                    was wanted in Seoul yesterday, and he was crushed to be leaving, needless to
                    say. We arrived, Sam left, and ten days later, I went back to Vienna to pay,
                    pack and follow. And ten days after that, after Tap had taken over as Charg�,
                    Mrs. Kennedy arrived on a semi-official trip. I don't have to tell you that
                    semi-official trips are the pits, give me one or t'other, but not the
                    in-between. She was our best export at the time, she was absolutely fantastic.
                    She had crowds just cheering everywhere we went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So where are we 1960 now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: This is 1961. And she finally decided, she was on Nomikos's family yacht
                    most of the time, I think she was recuperating from the loss of the baby at that
                    point. But she was the guest of the prime minister. And so she eventually
                    decided she had better give a party. So we were going to do this at the
                    Residence.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Briggs [Ellis O. Briggs was Ambassador to Greece 1959-62] had gone on
                    leave, and then he had had to, oh what's the word, he'd had to escort Adlai
                    Stevenson around Latin America so that he was going to be gone about five
                    months. That's why he screamed for Tap. So we had the party at the Residence and
                    she got up to make the toast and she has that very soft, rather breathy voice
                    and she paused, and was obviously searching for the word and the whole dinner
                    table of 50-odd people were straining to help her. And it was a very nice
                    speech. So afterwards our assistant PAO went up to her and said, “Oh, Mrs.
                    Kennedy, that was simply wonderful. People would love to have a copy of that.
                    Could you possibly re-constitute it?” “Sure,” she said, and reaching down her
                    front, pulled out the speech. (laughter) She'd done a very professional job.</p>
                <p>And it was a wonderful time to be in Greece because Americans were popular.
                    Karamanlis was prime minister and we had a nice house and a nice household and
                    thoroughly nice chiefs, Ellis Briggs and then Henry Labouisse [Henry Labouisse
                    was Ambassador to Greec1962-65].So we had a marvelous time there.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>I decided to learn Greek as we'd gone to an Hellenic-American, no AHEPA — an
                    Hellenic-American organization that's based here in the States — gathering. They
                    have them twice a year, and Tap was supposed to make a speech and there were a
                    lot of speeches and only Tap's was in English and we didn't really know whether
                    to laugh, cry, smile or what to do. And I decided that this wasn't going to
                    happen again, that I would at least know what was being said, so I took lessons.
                    And I had a wonderful arrangement. I took the brain washing course the Embassy
                    put on first and then decided I didn't like this business of saying, “I will
                    come yesterday,” or vice versa, and so I eventually ended up with a young man
                    who was a law student. I made the arrangement that I would pay by the hour and
                    he would come at 12 noon. He would stay until Tap came home for lunch. Sometimes
                    it was 2 o'clock, sometimes it was 3 o'clock, but in the beginning I had him
                    every day through the week and then it simmered down to about three times a
                    week.</p>
                <p>By the time I left, I was very fluent in Demotic Greek. I still wasn't good at
                    reading the newspapers, the print was atrocious. And Katharevousa is a little
                    bit like the French subjunctive with that little word ne in French, which can or
                    can not mean yes or no. And so when I tried to read the headlines, the only time
                    I really knew what the score was, was when it was De Gaulle, because you knew he
                    was being negative (laughter covers up words).</p>
                <p>Greece is a delightful country and it was such an open society, even though they
                    had the monarchy on top. My feeling about monarchies is that they just add an
                    extra dimension to life which just complicates the thing. We had a lot of fun.
                    We were young enough then so that we weren't too old to be included in parties
                    for the Crown Prince and princesses.</p>
                <p>As I say, we had a lot of good Greek friends. I have one Greek friend, her
                    husband subsequently was at the U.N., then he was at the Common Market in
                    Brussels. And she said, “I never write you letters because if I never write you
                    letters, I think of you, but if I write you, I stop thinking of you,” which I
                    have thought was the most wonderful (laughter) excuse.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you obviously enjoyed your Foreign Service career.
                        Did you enjoy your Foreign Service childhood as fully? You just took it for
                        granted, I suppose</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Oh, well. I was an only child. My first recollections are of the park in
                    Riga when I was three and four and just odd scenes, nothing very significant.
                    And then we came home to Washington, partly because my grandfather at that point
                    was dying. So we were around for a year and a half and I went to Potomac and had
                    a French madame who would come in in the afternoon. And I was supposed to take
                    naps in those days. And she and I had a number of set-tos.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>I got quite good at getting rid of the French. You know the French have this,
                    especially the French, but I think most Europeans have this engaging idea that
                    just because you're an adult, you should be obeyed. And this is not what the
                    American infant is brought up to be believe. And this particular madame
                    foundered on the matter of discipline and my mother solved it by saying that
                    since I was so unpleasant, I obviously must need a laxative and gave me castor
                    oil and put me to bed and madame didn't come any more.</p>
                <p>But two weeks before we were due to go to Buenos Aires, she was desperate because
                    she knew she had to have somebody for me because social life was so intense down
                    there, and my grandmother interviewed this charming young woman who was a Swiss
                    girl who was only about 22, I think, at the time and she'd already been in the
                    States for about two or three years. As Miquette told it, she was listening to
                    the previous governess apparently unloading herself about how the family was all
                    right, but the child was absolutely impossible. Well Miquette had been with the
                    direct opposite arrangement before, so she thought that it couldn't be too bad,
                    and my grandmother interviewed her, and except for thinking that she was awfully
                    young, sent her on down.</p>
                <p>Well I remember Miquette came down to pick me up with Mummy at Potomac School and
                    said something and smiled and she didn't have any trouble with me. I think she
                    spanked me once. Most of the time it was just - of course she was sensible and
                    she was loving and didn't make a fuss about things that didn't matter, so I had
                    seven lovely years with her. She went to Buenos Aires with us. This was the way
                    it was as far as I was concerned. I've always thought it was a huge mistake when
                    you have children to offer them choices or let them think things could be
                    different. You tell them this is the way it is and they accept it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think there's something in that, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: I know there is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I feel that my children grew up knowing nothing else. You
                        must have grown up much the same way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Yes, well leaving Buenos Aires after five years was quite a wrench. I
                    learned to ride there. It was still the old-style life because you had
                    governesses in those days, it was the done thing and all that. And again I have
                    great trouble deciding what was peculiar to the Foreign Service and what was
                    peculiar to the lifestyle of the social walk that my family lived in, so it's a
                    little hard to separate them. The disadvantage is perhaps, my mother decided she
                    wanted to come back to the States and the question was to have three summers in
                    a row or three winters in a row from Buenos Aires. So she opted for three
                    winters in a row and was able to get me into Chapin in New York for the first .
                    . .</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where she had gone?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Yes. For the first term. I mean it was only going to be one term and
                    they were willing to accept me on that basis. And I got to Chapin. Now mind you,
                    I was accustomed to eating with my parents at lunchtime with their guests, I was
                    accustomed to a certain amount of intelligent conversation. I got to fifth grade
                    and was very interested to see how things were done in the States in school
                    because of course I didn't really remember first and second grades much. And
                    apparently sounded off one time too many about the differences or similarities
                    between the two scholastic systems because I was in public school in Buenos
                    Aires, Argentine public school by this time, and I was promptly dubbed “Maggie
                    Wheatena from Argentina.” And I hated it and my grandmother hated the “Maggie”
                    part even more. And I didn't have sense enough to “if you can't lick 'em, join
                    'em” then.</p>
                <p>So here I was dubbed with this thing. And then I went back to B.A. and then the
                    next year Chapin couldn't take me, but they would take me in the afternoon for
                    sports. And I had the best luck because, I don't know how Mummy did it, but she
                    got me into, it no longer exists, the King Coit Drama School. And there we
                    lived, breathed and acted Shakespeare. Math was done in Shakespearean terms. It
                    was fantastic and such fun. I really enjoyed it so much and I have had a love of
                    Shakespeare ever since. But the “Maggie” stuck at Chapin and when I came back to
                    Foxcroft, I was a four-year girl at Foxcroft, there was part of the same Chapin
                    clique there and of course I promptly became Maggie. This time I was smart
                    enough to know that if you can't lick 'em, join 'em, so I insisted on being
                    called Maggie by everybody to my grandmother's great distress. I didn't get on
                    with my own class particularly well. I got along beautifully with the class
                    ahead of me and very well with the class below me and I thoroughly enjoyed the
                    teachers and the school was in an absolutely beautiful location and so I'd say
                    on the whole, it was a perfectly happy experience, although probably my first
                    year it wasn't really homesickness, but just that I was different.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were a boarder at Foxcroft?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Yes. At that time they didn't have day students. I must say we were very
                    lucky. We had good teachers then. If you wanted to study hard, you could. After
                    four years in boarding school I certainly didn't want to go and enroll myself in
                    a female establishment again. I don't think my grandmother would have approved
                    of a proper coed institution and I ended up attending Julliard School of Musical
                    Art which was a mistake in one way in that I wasn't ever going to be a concert
                    pianist and I wasn't good enough. All it did was give me professional standards
                    without the ability to live up to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which grandmother - is this your mother's mother who was
                        exerting this influence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Yes, and you see I was left with her during holidays. And she, poor
                    dear, had my teenage difficulties to put up with. For instance, my parents by
                    this time were in Calcutta. Mummy came home one summer and took me out to
                    Calcutta which was quite a trip in those days. We flew from Leipzig and that was
                    the way to fly because you came down for meals (laughter) and you came down for
                    the night, too. Oh, it was lovely.</p>
                <p>But they got malignant malaria from which one either died or recovered and didn't
                    get again, on the way back from Kashmir where we'd been trekking and so they did
                    both obviously recover, but they were in no shape to travel. The doctor wouldn't
                    let Mummy travel. So with fear and trembling my parents put me on the train from
                    Calcutta to Bombay as the charge of Ali, our Mohammedan bearer.</p>
                <p>It was no big deal because there were no aisles on the train, so you got served
                    from every station. Ali would check on me every station. That was all right. I
                    taught myself to type during those three days. Then I got to Bombay and was in
                    the care of our Consul there. He was supposed to find somebody to chaperone me
                    on the ship to Naples. And I remember he included me in his party when he went
                    to the Dutch National Day or Queen Wilhelmina's birthday or whatever it was. I
                    had visions of drinking a toast to the Queen and smashing the glass. I should
                    have known better from the Dutch, but there's no such thing. . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Waste a glass like that! (laughs)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: It was in the hotel anyway. But he found a young college girl, I guess
                    she was a sophomore, 19, to look after me on the ship. Well, that was very
                    interesting because it was a great question as to who was chaperoning whom. She
                    was a real flirt and had every youth on the ship sighing. And they would come
                    and weep on my shoulder. (laughter) I couldn't quite see what all the fuss was
                    about. My father had made me promise that I would not set foot in Port Said. And
                    I wasn't going to but then I discovered that there was an American Express tour
                    of Cairo and the pyramids and I thought, “Well, I may never get back again.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How old were you at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>BENNETT: Fifteen. And so I discovered - there was a whole college crowd on board
                    including the divorced mother of one of the students and his tutor and in
                    retrospect I sort of wonder about the tutor in relationship to Mama, but
                    nevertheless, Mama was there, and I thought if I went with Mama and clung to
                    Mama, Daddy couldn't really complain if I broke my promise. So we went up to the
                    pyramids and that was interesting. And we got to the museum which was like a
                    junk shop, it was so higgledy-piggledy. And then we spent an inordinate amount
                    of time as far as I was concerned in the bazaars and finally got the train back
                    to Port Said and went down to the waterfront and no ship. Due in about 8.</p>
                <p>So clinging to Mama, we went to what was billed as the best hostelry and I don't
                    know what everybody else drank, I had an orange juice, and after 8 o'clock we
                    went back to the waterfront, still no ship. So I guess we went back to the same
                    hostelry, I don't really remember. By this time it was dark and they had some
                    light around the edges and the audience seemed to be mainly men, which I didn't
                    realize at the time was typical for that country. And this floor was mosaic in
                    fact. And on limped this woman who then did sort of a ballet dance, but it
                    seemed to me the men's eyes were glittering, and oh, it was terribly romantic. I
                    guess that was my very proper upbringing. I don't know, being a very prissy
                    little girl at that point.</p>
                <p>Well, then the gang got up and decided to go back to the waterfront again — still
                    no ship. Then I spotted a bookshop. I still had a little money left and went in
                    and I looked for the fattest book I could find which turned out to be the
                    Kristin Lavransdatter and I think if my father had known I was reading that,
                    he'd have been much more upset than by my being in Port Said under those
                    circumstances. But anyway, I found it, paid for it and sat under the single bare
                    bulb reading until 1 o'clock in the morning when the ship finally came in.
                    (laughter)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is Kristin Lavransdatter?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: It's a three-volume novel by Sigrid Undset about marriage, and love,
                    which my father wouldn't have approved of my reading at that age.</p>
                <p>Then we finally arrived in Naples and the Consul General, who I think, was Isaiah
                    Bowman had just arrived and he was still in the hotel, it was the Excelsior, and
                    I'd had a room there. And Bruno Mussolini, the son of Mussolini, and entourage
                    had decided to come down to Naples for the weekend and pre-empted the whole
                    floor so my room had gone by the board. But the Bowmans very kindly let me sleep
                    on the sofa in their suite which was very hard on them, I would think. And I had
                    about four days between ships and the Byingtons were in the Consulate at the
                    time and Fritz Jandrey and I forget who some of the others were - they organized
                    a picnic up Vesuvius by moonlight which was great fun. And Vesuvius had been
                    erupting somewhat by that point. You could look up at the top and see a red glow
                    and we went, oh, I suppose two-thirds of the way up, with a mule in tow carrying
                    the picnic and what not and decided to picnic.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>Well, it was a rather chilly evening , but one sat down on what one thought was
                    rock and the next thing one did was to stand up because Vesuvius had given a
                    little puff and it was too hot to sit on! (laughter) Anyhow, I thoroughly
                    enjoyed that and then was put on the Rex and had a wonderful time picking up all
                    sorts of people on this ship, none of whom my grandmother thought much of,
                    including the Jesuit priest who had the cabin next to mine (laughter) with whom
                    I kept up for quite some time.</p>
                <p>But it was fun, but my poor grandmother suffered terribly after that because
                    anytime she wanted to stop me from doing something such as - I mean my bounds in
                    New York. I could walk down - she lived at 67th and Park, I could walk uptown to
                    I suppose the Metropolitan Museum, but I wasn't allowed to walk below
                    Bloomingdales on Lexington and that was rather dubious. I certainly was not
                    allowed to walk on Third Avenue and I could go down Madison as far as, I guess
                    Altman's, 34th Street, and I could go down Fifth as far as Altman's, but again
                    with many palpitations on the part of my grandmother. And sometimes she wouldn't
                    want me to do something. And I'd say, “But Grandmother, if I could come back
                    from India by myself, surely. . .!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me a little bit about her because she must have been
                        formidable.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: My grandmother was five foot two and one quarter and mind you remembered
                    the quarter, and very dainty. She went white very early on - I think in her
                    thirties - so that by the time I knew her, she was white-haired. People used to
                    describe her as a cross between a Dresden china doll and a French marquise. And
                    she always dressed beautifully and was very dainty in her manners. And me with
                    my elbow gestures and so forth. She tried to make a silk purse out of a sow's
                    ear.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>But she just wasn't going to make a nice dainty person out of me. The build was
                    wrong and the whole approach was wrong. She was left a widow due to an
                    automobile accident in 1916. And she had never handled her own affairs before.
                    Women didn't in those days. And the two boys I guess were - well Pierrepont was
                    in Groton still and I guess Abbot had started Groton, and the Rector of Groton,
                    Endicott Peabody - she asked him for advice to deal with the boys. And he said,
                    “Well I think you should read articles and go to public affairs lectures and you
                    should be interested in such matters.” So she did that and she became
                    fantastically well-informed on things and thereby inculcated, or at least
                    encouraged both boys to be interested in it. And I don't know how much - my
                    mother's never really talked about that period very much because she was in the
                    car, so that I think that was a rather traumatic period. But when the U.S. got
                    in the War, my mother was able to go down and get a telephone job, again rather
                    a departure from normal family activities. But Grandmother went down and was a
                    Gray Lady at the docks and she used to write letters for these poor soldiers and
                    the family used to roar with laughter over that because she had a very difficult
                    handwriting. Daddy used to say that he could read my grandmother's writing and
                    my mother could read his father's writing, but neither could read their own
                    parent's writing. (laughter) It was good training for me, though, because I can
                    usually decipher most handwritings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Having had experience.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Yes. But anyway, Grandmother had very, very strong feelings of right and
                    wrong and what was done and what was not done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As they did in those days.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: I always thought she was a little too concerned with what the public
                    thought. To me, I came along thinking all of this smacked of hypocrisy and I was
                    also awfully bored by just the well-born that she wanted me to associate with
                    because they weren't interesting to me. And I don't know what I wanted, but it
                    certainly wasn't that.</p>
                <p>As I say, from the time my parents went to Calcutta, I was hers for vacations and
                    she shepherded me through the proper New York social routine, the subscription
                    dances which I think are enough to scar you for life, the system, unless you are
                    a raving beauty. I went through all of those and the first two seasons, she
                    hired a chaperone to escort me to and from and I used to get very put out
                    because I said, “But all my friends can go and be brought home by boys.” No
                    indeed, I couldn't be. And once or twice I was very grateful because the boys
                    were all experimenting with alcohol. Some of them used to pass out and it was
                    very unpleasant.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>The chaperone rejoiced in the name of “Melbournia”. (pronounced Melbonia) Of
                    course she'd been named because she'd been born in Melbourne, Australia. And
                    Melbonia she looked, too. (laughter) I finally enjoyed the New York social
                    season a bit when I'd come out. By that time I'd finally acquired a few boys who
                    enjoyed being with me and so I had my own little stag line, but the first dance
                    I went to was really ghastly because Grandmother gave a dinner before it for me,
                    the boys were not exactly imbued with the social graces. And I only knew three
                    boys in the whole of the U.S. so that it was really quite traumatic.</p>
                <p>As I say, once I'd finished coming out, then I had a lot of fun and met all sorts
                    of people and so on. That was part of the Foreign Service aspect, being shipped
                    to Grandmother for such a long time at a stretch. I guess normally children are
                    shipped to Grandmother for maybe a week now and then. Grandmothers might like to
                    have them longer, but . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yours was years. So did you ever really live with your
                        parents again after that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: No, I never lived with them. I visited them in Haiti and I visited them
                    in Peru. I was there for about two months. Then Tap began sounding as if he
                    might be going to Germany and that didn't suit my plans at all, so I said
                    good-bye to my parents and went up to at least see him before he went off to
                    Germany. It turned out that he'd probably be going on a trip and that didn't
                    transpire until after we were married. Then he was seconded from the Army at
                    Warren's request to the San Francisco Conference and so he was at that.</p>
                <p>And he was the one who set our wedding date and so it was only he that could
                    reproach himself that he'd done so because he had to leave just before it ended,
                    he was furious! (laughter)</p>
                <p>So then we had been very fortunate through my grandmother's pull in landing an
                    apartment in Parkfairfax which is where we lived for the first year and a half
                    we were married. Our eldest was born while we were there, courtesy of the Army
                    at Walter Reed. The whole thing cost $7.00. Be it said that I saw three
                    obstetric doctors and the fourth one was the one who delivered me, but never
                    mind. No complications, I survived very happily.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>And the one thing about Parkfairfax, we were on the middle floor. Tap had given
                    me a very nice gardenia, for having produced the son and heir. It had so many
                    blossoms, we decided to try to keep the thing alive. We discovered that by
                    putting it in the kitchen sink and running the water about this high, it would
                    last the weekend very nicely. So fine, we were going out to my parents in
                    Maryland for the weekend. The baby had been teething and was fussy and the phone
                    had been ringing right and left and I was packing the car and so forth. And Tap
                    called and said that he was ready now and I had put the plant in to water it.
                    There hadn't been enough water so anyhow, I kept it going. Came back on Monday
                    and thought there's something strange about this floor, something's different, I
                    couldn't quite figure out what it was. Anyhow, I unpacked, got the baby in and
                    so forth, walked into the kitchen, and somebody had had the crass nerve to take
                    my plant out of the kitchen sink.</p>
                <p>Well, I went on about my business and noticed out the window that people seemed
                    to be coming and going in a great deal of the neighbor's apartment, but they had
                    been having work done anyhow, so I didn't think anything about it. Presently,
                    the doorbell rang and it was one of the Parkfairfax maintenance people and they
                    said, “Would you come downstairs a minute?” So I said, “Fine.” And they said,
                    “You see this?” And they showed me some discolored things and I said, “Yes.”
                    “You see this?” And I said, “Yes. Would you mind telling me what all this is
                    about?” He said, “You mean you don't know?” And I said, “No.” “Well your
                    upstairs neighbor noticed water coming out underneath her doo(which was on the
                    same level as ours) and called us and you had left the water running in the
                    sink.” Tap said it would have been a lot cheaper if he'd bought me corsages
                    daily. (laughter) We were due to move in two weeks, which was the worst part of
                    it. And Parkfairfax was simply horrid. They dunned me everyday to know if we
                    were going to pay the whatever it was that we owed them which we were going to
                    do the day we left.</p>
                <p>Anyhow, then we moved into our house in Georgetown and my parents at that time
                    still had a house that they had bought to assemble everything in order to throw
                    out. They had a yard man and so Mummy very kindly said that she would send him
                    along. His name, I think, was Roane and my father was great at nicknaming people
                    and the man had such a presence that Daddy used to call him the Duc de Rohan.
                    And anyway the Duc de Rohan came, and I carefully explained that he was to be
                    very careful of my precious gardenia which hadn't been doing too well in the
                    garden. Well anyway, the Duke came along and proceeded to level everything
                    including the gardenia! (laughter)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After all that! (more laughter)</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>BENNETT: Anyway, the Timberlakes lived right around the corner from us. Tim
                    Timberlake had been in the consulate when Daddy was in Buenos Aires. He was much
                    older than Julie who was a day younger than I. She had a fourteen-month old and
                    mine was eighteen months old. We both were pregnant as all get-out at this time.
                    We used to puff the hill to Montrose Park and puff back down again. We both had
                    boys the second time around. But she had an Rh factor so all her children after
                    the first one had to be pumped full of blood, but she went right on and had
                    five, too. It was quite amazing. Anyhow, we had very pleasant times in
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>Then Tap went to the National War College in '55 and then was assigned as Robert
                    Murphy's executive assistant for a year which was wonderful training. Murphy was
                    a marvelous man. Later, we had great fun because he and Ellis Briggs had their
                    70th birthdays just about the same time. We found this birthday card and sent it
                    to each of them.</p>
                <p>And the reaction was very interesting because the birthday card read, “Since you
                    and I are good friends, we've known each other for so long, I'd like to ask you
                    a personal question.” Turn the page. “What was Abe Lincoln really like?”
                    (laughter) So we sent it to them both and never heard boo from Ellis which
                    rather surprised me because Ellis did have a good sense of humor. But apparently
                    this didn't strike his funny bone.</p>
                <p>Murphy wrote back the most enchanting letter saying, “Oh thank you so much for
                    remembering my birthday. It was very nice of you to remember and, since you
                    asked, Abe, I called him Abe, you know . . .” And he went on from there and spun
                    this charming fantasy. (laughter) But anyway, you should talk to Sally Briggs
                    when you can get a hold of her. There's another.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Pat Squire plans to talk Lucy Briggs</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Oh she's a love. I've never known anybody to have such serenity. She
                    just radiates this sort of peacefulness. She was a very forceful person because
                    she forced the American Women's Organization of Greece to takGreek members,
                    which didn't set well with the founders of the club. It was something she felt,
                    I think quite rightly, needed to be done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did she do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Well, there was an American Women's Club of Greece, AWOG as it was
                    called, and it was the place that Americans, especially the businesswomen who
                    founded it, went to when they had had enough of local culture and could sound
                    off about those “awful people” sort of thing. Lucy felt that the time had come,
                    was long since past, for that sort of thing. One ought to be open. The Greeks
                    were great joiners of clubs. And so she made them have Greek members.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>Well the trouble was that we were swamped with people joining. And it was all
                    very overlapping because there was an Hellenic-American Women's Club, there was
                    the Hellenic something-else Club and they all did more or less the same thing
                    and had the same membership. I remember saying to our then Economic Counselor's
                    wife, “I do wish they'd just amalgamate so that one wouldn't have to have all
                    these meetings,” because I was Madam Meeting, Madam Representative for the
                    Embassy. And I remember Helen saying, “You don't think Mrs. Micheli is going to
                    give up her job as president do you?” (laughter).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That sounds quite a bit, but I must say the Netherlands
                        American Women's Club in Rotterdam was the best organization like that I
                        ever belonged to overseas because it immediately put us in contact with the
                        Dutch. And it sounds like maybe you had an overload, but nonetheless, I
                        agree with Mrs. Briggs, don't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Well, yes! Now in Brussels, they have an American Women's Club and of
                    course it used to be such a center for American business. They had, I think, 900
                    American or foreign-born American wives who were members. It's the only one I
                    know of that owns its own club house.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: And they have all sorts of programs. I can't remember what. I was
                    honorary and I really didn't go there much. I think I went there twice during
                    the time I was in Brussels simply because at that time I had had club life, and
                    I felt it was my colleague, the ambassador's wife to Belgium's job to do that.
                    (laughs) They had a very gung-ho program and so forth and it's a nice place. As
                    I say, I don't remember what their arrangement was for foreign members. You
                    could certainly bring them for guests which you hadn't been able to do at the
                    Greek one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me jump way back because I don't know when I'll be
                        able to talk to your mother again. You mentioned that she had a very
                        interesting time in Germany in the '30's. Now do you remember any of
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Well, we got there in January of '34, I think it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you would have been?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>BENNETT: I was twelve. And I was allowed to come to the table at lunchtime and
                    they used to do a lot of entertaining at lunch with different peoplPutzi
                    Hanfstaengel who was Hitler's crony - he was a lightweight type - but he used to
                    play the piano. Anyhow he was one of those people whom one felt one should
                    entertain. I remember his coming to lunch. But get Mummy to tell you about the
                    time we went to the people who lived in, I think it was Wannsee, the day of June
                    30th, '34, which was the bloodbath day because that was quite an interesting
                    experience for her.</p>
                <p>I'll tell you my bit of it, not that day, but I was put in the Mommsenschule
                    which was the private school for girls run by the daughter or the niece of the
                    historian Theodor Mommsen. She wore a long gray flannel dress with her hair up
                    in a bun and sort of a bib in front. Did you ever see that movie “Maedchen in
                    Uniform” because it was very much the style of clothing she wore. She was
                    something of a martinet, but not nearly as bad as she might have been. The
                    French teacher, Fraulein Schwerin also wore that. The other teachers were more
                    up-to-date. And this school went from, well I suppose age eleven up through I
                    suppose, I don't know, the German classes were different, but I think probably
                    up through high school was what it amounted to. And it catered to the lesser
                    nobility, the junkers, and the Army. And they did let foreigners in and the
                    daughter of our Assistant Military Attach� was my best friend. She and I were in
                    the same class, out of a class of thirteen girls, actually. We had in my class a
                    girl whose surname was von Spiegelberg. She was definitely Jewish. We had a
                    couple of other foreigners and we had a couple of merchant daughters. Anyhow,
                    that was our class.</p>
                <p>Von Schleicher, who was the general, he was murdered and his wife, too, on the
                    30th of June, and their daughter attended school. And she came back all dressed
                    in black about a week after the event. It was quite interesting.</p>
                <p>I asked my father. We were supposed to say, “Heil Hitler” and do the salute and
                    all that. I said, “What do I do?” He said, “Do as they do, but don't go out of
                    your way.” And periodically Hitler would make a speech and we'd all have to
                    listen to it on the radio. Boring!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was all in German, of course.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: This was all in German, so I was having quite a struggle the first half,
                    although I'd spoken German in Latvia, I'd forgotten it and had French and
                    Spanish in-between. So I thought German was a most difficult language. My
                    children, whom I put in French school in Austria after they'd had German three
                    years in Austria, thought French was the most difficult language. So I
                    understood those two languages. We had all the normal subjects and after my
                    first term, I began getting, oh, three's in German which was a C, which I
                    thought was quite . . .</p>

                <p>
                    <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Go ahead then. In the “Heil Hitler” - did you do that as
                        we do the Pledge of Allegiance in the morning?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Oh yes. Every time the teacher came in it was “Heil Hitler”. I mean
                    rather or more this way because when I first got to the school, they were
                    relatively relaxed about it. Then the powers that be started cracking down and
                    it was announced that we would all have to an hour a week of Nazi
                    indoctrination. I asked my father again, “Do I take this or not?” And he said,
                    “Take it, but don't believe a word of it” sort of thing. Mostly it was so dull
                    that one went to sleep. There was one interesting period to me when they were
                    discussing the Germans in enclaves hither and yon. I wished I'd paid more
                    attention to that because certainly the Latin American ones would have been
                    useful to remember later on in life, but that, because it was geography and
                    history was a little bit better, but the rest was very dull.</p>
                <p>But then they began having more militant Nazi teachers. I remember we had one - I
                    think she was not naturally that, but felt that she had to almost overplay her
                    hand. And she got rather firm about everybody doing their “Heil Hitler” salute
                    properly and so forth. In my class, we had one girl who was a Hitler Maedel or
                    BDM as they were called, Bund Deutsche Maedel, I think it was. She apparently
                    had been told that she must do something about the Jewish girl in our class. And
                    she had one very good friend who was quite a nice girl who was her special
                    sidekick, but the good friend wasn't in the BDM. Well I was not present when
                    this scene occurred and the reason I was not there, it was one that I think
                    illustrated the German mentality perfectly. I was being hauled on the carpet for
                    the misdeeds of my fellow Americans, some of them in other classes, because my
                    father was the ranking American. And so I missed this great scene. But
                    apparently in the recess yard, the BDM girl chose that moment to go up to the
                    von Spiegelberg girl and call her a couple of nasty names, “You something
                    Jewess”, something like that. And, interestingly enough, the Jewish girl burst
                    into tears, but the whole school rallied around her and sent this girl, the BDM
                    girl, to Coventry. And when I got back to class, my American pal said “We're not
                    talking to her anymore. And the whole class has agreed - will you pass the
                    pencil, please, yes, but I mean nothing other than that.” So only her good
                    friend stood by her, and for the rest of that year, we did not talk to her. I
                    thought it was extremely interesting. Well, I left in spring of '36.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But before you leave, tell me, how were you called on the
                        carpet for the misdeeds of the others? I mean, were you supposed to go back
                        and tell your father that these girls were . . . (laughs)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: I don't know what I was supposed to do. I thought it was so ridiculous,
                    that I just said yes, Ja Ja, and just sat through it and then said to my friend,
                    “What the devil am I supposed to do about this?” (laughs) Besides, some of these
                    girls were older than I, even had I been under the illusion that I could control
                    them, they wouldn't have listened to me in the first place, but it was
                    funny.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And so this school, you were 1934 to 1936?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: '36. I went back on the way to India in '37 because the plane flew from
                    Leipzig and so we stopped in Berlin for a while and I went back to see my
                    classmates . The school was still extant then, but I think it was the next year
                    that the Air Ministry decided that it needed the building and I think Fraulein
                    Mommsen by this time had seen the handwriting on the wall, so she gave up the
                    school entirely and I guess moved elsewhere. During the War it was bombed and it
                    was a hole in the ground when we went back to Berlin in '69. It was a curious
                    arrangement really.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think your father's advice to go along with it, but
                        don't believe it, was the best he could of asked you to do at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Well, they (the school) could have given me German tutoring at that
                    time, or I could have been given homework or something. I had a lovely time, I
                    mean they had Handarbeit. So we were supposed to learn sewing and knitting and
                    all that. So I did learn something about crocheting and I did learn about
                    knitting. But then when it came to embroidery, somehow or other this didn't
                    really grab me and also I was in the middle of reading a book which had been
                    recommended by my German teacher who had come and tutored me at the beginning at
                    home. It was called The Secret of the Old Mamselle. And you can imagine from the
                    title what it was.</p>
                <p>I had begun this book and was deep in it and just really wanted to go on reading.
                    So I conceived the notion of saying that since I wasn't really very good at
                    Handarbeit, and I really needed to work on my German, couldn't I read this aloud
                    to the class. So that was quite all right with everybody and we all had a lovely
                    time. We were just about get to the juicy part when suddenly (laughter) Fraulein
                    Mommsen came in, and said, “What are you reading?” and confiscated the book.
                    (laughter) Which meant everybody promptly was going for a copy wherever they
                    could find it. Q: You know for someone who was brought up in a most controlled
                    manner, you seem to be a very free spirit. Was this all rebellion or did you
                    just, as you say, you learned how to go along with it?</p>
                <p>BENNETT: It was controlled, as I say. My grandmother was simply marvelous just so
                    long as it wasn't anything downright dangerous or not sensible and so forth. I
                    didn't try to get out of the norms. When it came to scholastics, I was very good
                    at doing my own thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>I remember at Foxcroft I took Latin and quickly discovered that I was doing Latin
                    from French and Spanish which is sort of the opposite of what you're supposed to
                    be doing in Latin. And this was a class that was being taught by a Virginia lady
                    who didn't really care much about Latin and she was not going to be teaching
                    after the next year and she just really didn't do much of anything. And most of
                    the class were repeaters anyway, and it was the worst thing. And there were
                    three of us who really rather liked Latin and we'd be getting A pluses on our
                    tests, but we never got beyond the ablative absolute in the first year and
                    barely got the first conjugation or the second conjugation, I forget what we did
                    finish. We did learn the motto of the State of Virginia, but other than that,
                    that was about it.</p>
                <p>So the three of us went to the academic head and said, “Look, we can't take this
                    class. The others are such dodoes in it. They aren't interested and we really
                    are interested. Couldn't we please be put in Latin III?” which meant that we
                    were going to miss out on Livy and a little more grammar. So she thought a while
                    and then said, “All right, you can go into Latin III.” Which we enjoyed. I don't
                    know about the others. My marks went down to B at that point. Well, then I knew
                    that Cicero was going to be a horrible class, and so I thought a little while
                    and I went to see the new Latin teacher who was quite a buddy of mine and I
                    said, “Look, I really don't want to sit through Cicero, I'd much rather take
                    Virgil,” which she was offering as an elective. “Can't I do that?” She said, “If
                    you want college credit, you've got to do Cicero.” I said, “What would happen if
                    I were to read Cicero by myself and take the exam when I come back? Then could
                    you give me credit?” So she thought for a while and said, all right, she'd do
                    that.</p>
                <p>So I took Cicero home and read it to myself, but just flipping through and just
                    getting the gist of it. I picked out all the famous passages on my own and had a
                    lovely time with it and studied vocabulary like mad and did nothing with grammar
                    and took the test when I got back to school. And sort of knew I hadn't done well
                    at all, but anyhow I bumped into Miss Fiala two days after this and said, “Well,
                    did you decide to pass me yet?” And she said, “No”, which was her mistake. And I
                    said, “I just want to tell you, if you put me in that Cicero class, I guarantee
                    to make your life total hell.” (laughter) It worked. I was translating “the
                    ghost's father” instead of “the father's ghost” and I had a lovely time in
                    Virgil and it was great fun. So I'm quite good at that kind of thing. Let's see,
                    you got onto something about . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, that it was interesting that your father told you to
                        go ahead and “Heil Hitler”, and listen to it but not believe. Well, he
                        probably had no alternative at that point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Well, he could have said,”Just say your father doesn't want you to
                    attend the class.” But he probably thought it wouldn't hurt me to be exposed to
                    something as dull as that. Which is why I never understood why anybody could get
                    excited about Marxism, having tried to read Das Kapital. (laughter) You just
                    can't get through it.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>One of the other things we did, I don't know that I had to do it. We did go to a
                    couple of the Hitler rallies which were quite something to go to and I was as
                    close to Hitler as I am to that wall and had a fairly good look at him. He
                    wasn't that impressive, but my goodness, there was something magnetic about his
                    voice. And then of course this orchestration of great shouts and all that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you did go to the rallies. With your parents?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: No. I think — I went with my parents to one or two. After they'd left,
                    my governess had gotten engaged to a German. He was from the Rhineland of Polish
                    extraction a couple of generations back, an awfully nice man. I remember the
                    three of us went to the Air Show along with my best friend and I had a camera
                    this big which was sort of a mini-Brownie and I innocently started taking
                    pictures with it. Somebody came along and confiscated the film. I mean obviously
                    they were accustomed to more sophisticated things and thought I was probably
                    trying to steal secrets. I was merely trying to see if the camera would actually
                    register! (laughter)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when your mother met Hitler, did she pass on her
                        impressions to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Well, that's why I want her to tell you because it's better when she
                    tells it than if I were to tell it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell me so that I'll know what to ask her?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Oh just ask her if she met Hitler ever and she'll take it from
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wish I'd known that because I could have asked her
                        during one of our other sessions. I don't know if she'll be willing to talk
                        again.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Oh, I'm sure she will.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sometime when she comes in again. Well, I think it's
                        interesting that you grew up in the Service and seemed to take it all in
                        stride.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Well, let's put it this way. I took it in stride. A lot of it was
                    natural. But . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And why was it natural then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Oh, I mean the social end of meeting foreigners, being comfortable with
                    foreigners, that part. What I did not take in stride was housekeeping, but then
                    housekeeping would have been difficult anyplace. I'm just not particularly fond
                    of it - who is - and this idea that this was supposed to be the be-all and the
                    apotheosis of one's aim in life. I found there was a world of difference between
                    being an irresponsible daughter and a wife and mother when I went into the
                    Service.</p>
                <p>The first inkling I had of this was when I was staying with the Warren[Avra M.
                    Warren was Ambassador to Panama 1944-45] in Panama and I discovered that Mrs.
                    Warren had to go down to the Commissary and do the shopping for the Embassy
                    because at that time they had the gold and silver commissaries and her Chinese
                    cook was not given the permission to do the marketing in the Commissary. And I
                    thought that was pretty hard lines when you had finally become an ambassador's
                    wife, the least that you could do was to be waited on. And then I remember being
                    rather impressed when I heard that Andr�e Sparks (Mrs. Edward) who by this time
                    was the wife of the Ambassador to Bolivia, she was having to cook the hams. Of
                    course her cook didn't do them right or something like that. It began to dawn on
                    me that maybe this wasn't such a bed of roses as I always thought it was.
                    (laughter)</p>
                <p>We were very lucky, you know. At ambassadorial posts we mostly inherited
                    households and since then, now, I don't know how it is with all of the
                    embassies, but certainly the European embassies, they've got social secretaries
                    who can help run households. I always used to say to mine, “Since you're the one
                    that has to deal with it, you just do it. I'll approve anything you want!”
                    (laughter)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And how about your five children? Are they scattered to
                        the winds? In the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: No. Our second son at one point said, “Tell me why I should join the
                    Foreign Service.” And I said, “No you don't. You tell us why you want to, but
                    we're not telling you.” And that took care of that. He actually ended up in the
                    Navy JAG (Judge Advocate General corps). And so far he's had home assignments.
                    And he's currently at Norfolk as the number two legal beagle at SACLANT (Supreme
                    Allied Command Atlantic) and the other admiral, I mean there are two admirals
                    wearing three hats, he's assigned to that.</p>
                <p>Our eldest never wanted to go abroad. He likes to travel, but... He served in
                    Vietnam and I think that's the extent of his wanting to be abroad. He likes
                    being in Washington and works for a firm here. He's very involved with the
                    Vietnam Vets' Coalition and that takes up a lot of his time.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>Our twins both took the Foreign Service exam for a lark and did not pass and
                    thought that was very amusing. I thought it was amusing they even thought of
                    taking the thing. But I think partly they thought they'd pacify papa over this.
                    Annie was an art history major and then discovered, after getting her master's
                    at Chicago, that jobs in museums aren't very plentiful and didn't want to do
                    galleries and ended up in the international student grant business for a while
                    and became very knowledgeable about the U.S. Visa system. Then she left that and
                    worked for the Carnegie Endowment people for a while. And everybody kept saying,
                    “Oh you ought to get your doctorate in educational administration.” She finally
                    succumbed to those blandishments and she's been working on her dissertation at
                    Harvard.</p>
                <p>It's a tedious procedure because it seems to me that you don't narrow it down
                    just to one angel dancing on the head of a pin, but you narrow it down to the
                    little toenail on the left foot of the angel. And you have to write jargon, too,
                    a certain amount. She was taught at Madeira to write English (laughter) so it
                    still doesn't come naturally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Learning a new language.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: And she doesn't like padding them as much as they require and she's
                    having difficulties with her computer. Her old one broke down so she's now
                    working on a new one. Well, you know what computers are like, so you can
                    sympathize.</p>
                <p>Her younger sister by six minutes married an English Anglican clergyman who is
                    the Vicar of Hebden Bridge in West Yorkshire. They have the grandson and a
                    daughter who is a year and a half. And Ellen, much to the family's amusement -
                    first of all, we all thought it was hysterical that she should be marrying a
                    parson. She's the last one we would have thought of doing so. And now she's
                    actually on the Parish church committee which is another laugh. And they've put
                    her on the financial planning committee which is even funnier because Ellen
                    finds that if she has a penny in her pocket, she's going to spend it. (laughs)
                    Apparently other people's money is a different story.</p>
                <p>And then Victoria is in Seattle. She graduated as a geologist from Tufts and came
                    down here and got a job immediately at the National Academy of Sciences and
                    discovered that instead of doing geology outdoors as she liked, she was being
                    asked to do grammar indoors. So she went on from that and worked on a grant at
                    Louisiana State for a year or so. And I don't know whether it was the money ran
                    out, [or] she couldn't take the climate anymore — she's got red hair and she
                    minds the heat horribly. And she piled into her rather elderly car and drove out
                    to Seattle where she had a couple of friends and where she has been ever
                    since.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>And after being president of one of the Toastmistress's clubs and re-writing the
                    constitution of almost all of them there, and teaching public speaking at the Y
                    and free-lancing on Kodiak for six months. I don't know what all else she hasn't
                    done. She bought three houses and did all the maintenance work including
                    changing a septic tank. She won't do the wiring, that's the only thing. She's
                    now settled in for the moment as an investment planner. She's working for
                    IDS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She sounds like a woman of many skills. How old is
                        she?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: She's just turned thirty-six.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So she's done a lot and has found herself.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: I think so. She knows what she likes. Now whether she's actually found
                    her final aim in life, that I'm not quite sure of, but she's awfully good at
                    that. When she first started in this, she'd go and — she's one of those awful
                    people who will call you up at dinnertime wanting to discuss your finances, but
                    she wants to come see you to do it, she makes that quite clear. The few people
                    she did get involved with, she'd started telling, “Now look. You cannot do this
                    and this and this. You must make a budget,” and that sort of thing. She very
                    good at that sort of thing.There's a strong teaching strain in my mother's
                    family and in my husband's family, so I guess she comes by it naturally. Well, I
                    don't know what else I can tell you about our various postings. NATO to me was
                    the most fascinating and I think also to Tap. As he used to say, his writ ran
                    from the Yukon to Mount Ararat. We covered most of that territory. To be at the
                    NATO Council is a wonderful thing because the Europeans send their best people
                    there. A lot of them go on to be foreign minister or have been foreign minister
                    or, in one case, I think he's gone on to be foreign minister. A lot of them have
                    been ambassadors in Moscow, and one or two have been in both Moscow and Beijing,
                    and it's an interesting group of people to be with. Unlike the U.N., you have
                    the feeling they're all pulling together. Maybe not the same method, but they
                    all are working towards something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A common goal.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: And to accomplish something, unlike the U.N. which has sort of gotten
                    kind of out of hand in the last few years. And we had Joseph Luns who is
                    essentially one of those bigger than life people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In every way. (laughs)</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>BENNETT: Yes, yes. And he told our departing Turkish colleague who was going to
                    be the perm rep in New York, “Monsieur, vous quittez le cercle pour le cirque”
                    And it's true, it's a very exclusive little club and it's like a wonderful
                    traveling house party because they have meetings in the different countries and
                    the wives are urged to come. You can go to the meetings as long as you - well,
                    you can't go to the Council meetings, but you can go to the plenary sessions and
                    there's usually a very nice program on and so you get to see a lot of the
                    countries.</p>
                <p>And then of course living in Belgium was quite a pleasure, too. It's a very
                    hospitable country, our spot in Brussels particularly, and such a nice city to
                    be in all told. It was just a lovely time to be there. (laughs)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what years were those?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: '77 to '83.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just before you retired?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Well, he expected to retire coming back and then Shultz asked him to
                    stay on for the election year in the Congressional Liaison job. Which is also an
                    interesting job, but it's such a stinker that we were counting the days and the
                    weeks and the hours practically until we could get out. So we were very grateful
                    to have that extra year because then we retired without any bitterness.
                    Otherwise, when one retires, one is still sort of looking over one's shoulder
                    saying, “Oh, if only I'd been able to stay on one more year or something!”
                    (laughs)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This way he found out what it was like. (laughs) There's
                        something in that, too. But I've noticed that your mother has traveled a
                        great deal in her life and continues to travel.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: And so do we!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you, too. And this, I think, goes back even before the
                        Foreign Service. It's simply been a family life.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>BENNETT: Well, to a certain extent. Of course my uncle was in the Service and so
                    Grandmother would go out and visit him and took Mummy. In fact Mummy really met
                    my father in Poland when she was visiting my uncle there. Grandmother used to go
                    out and visit Pierrepont, I mean she went out to Tokyo to visit him. And she
                    apparently infuriated Pierrepont because she sat next to somebody, I don't know
                    whether he was a Japanese or whether he was another foreign diplomat of some
                    kind. Anyhow, she asked the man this question which she thought was a perfectly
                    normal question and the man answered at great length. So Grandmother regaled
                    Pierrepont with this and he said, “He had no right to tell you that! And you
                    shouldn't have asked that question either!” (laughter)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the contrary, I would have thought he should have been
                        very grateful, but he wasn't! (overlapping conversations) Now where does the
                        name Pierrepont come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Well, my grandmother's maiden name was Pierrepont. The original
                    Pierrepont to come to this country, they spelled it then with only one r, I
                    don't know if he was one of the founders of Yale, but anyhow he was at Yale.
                    Amongst other things they had several cemetery lots, that's one thing the family
                    jokingly refers to. I really ought to remember more. I mean, somebody did the
                    genealogy and of course got us way back to William the Conqueror, but I take
                    some of that with a grain of salt. They have pretty well documented most of
                    them. Then we had the Pierrepont who came down to the New York area who was
                    Hezekiah Beers, can you imagine a worse name than that? Anyhow, Mrs. Hezekiah
                    Beers thought it would be more stylish to spell it with the double r, e, so she
                    was the one who brought us back to the original spelling.</p>
                <p>And then my grandmother's mother was a Low and they were from Salem, Mass. and
                    were in the China trade. One of her, oh I guess she'd have been a great aunt,
                    was Harriet Low who went out to visit her brother - Grandmother's grandfather -
                    who was in Macao at the time. Harriet wrote her memoirs and she was a rather
                    forceful type because women were not supposed to go up to Canton and she managed
                    to go to Canton as one of the first ladies to go. And they sort of helped break
                    the rules. This was before the Opium War and so forth. And so, for certain
                    there's travel in the Low blood and I don't know.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>On my father's mother's side. She was a Rutherfurd. They came from around New
                    Jersey, I don't know that they were so much into traveling unless it was sort of
                    the grand tour type of thing. The Pierrepont aunts, they were two maiden ladies
                    and a widowed uncle who sort of rather brought my grandmother up. Her mother
                    died when she was twelve, leaving the four older children, of whom Grandmother
                    was the youngest - no, she was the younger girl, she was the second. And there
                    were two little boys who were sort of afterthoughts, they were ten and twelve
                    years younger. And the aunts brought them up. And they were gorgeously Victorian
                    in what they did and didn't dThey used to belong to the Girls' Friendly Society
                    at Grace Church in Brooklyn. And the house was completely Victorian in style.
                    Grandmother. Now talk about a contained, orderly period of growing up,
                    Grandmother had it. Well, she was allowed to go to Miss Packer's Institute in
                    Brooklyn by herself, walking there. She met my grandfather somewhere.
                    Grandfather was twelve or fourteen years older than she. Grandfather would be
                    going to the office, so they'd pass each other on the street. And he started
                    tipping his hat. And she eventually would sort of dip a little a curtsey or bow
                    - I don't know what, I guess she'd curtsey. One day, she thought it would be fun
                    to see what would happen if she didn't. The next day he came rushing - he came
                    to call to inquire if he'd done something wrong. (laughter)</p>
                <p>When any young man was brave enough to come and call on either Aunt Annie or
                    Grandmother, my great-grandfather apparently would sit in the back of the room
                    this way (laughter). My grandfather apparently was clever enough to realize he
                    had to get around Papa, so he'd come and play chess or checkers with Papa, but
                    would pay some attention to Grandmother. And when apparently he finally asked my
                    great-grandfather for Grandmother's hand, Great-Grandfather was reputed to have
                    said, “Why not Annie? The older one.” (laughter) Well, that was a sort of
                    never-never type of childhood. My mother's type of growing up was a little
                    closer to - I don't know if you read the book that Louis Auchincloss wrote about
                    Adele Tobin. Mummy was younger than that, but that was roughly the style. And
                    they were much wealthier, so it was a little grander style, but that was . .

                        knickerbockers. And that Miss Chapin's was the first school to do that and
                        she was in the first class that did that. And having to wrap a skirt over
                        that for propriety.</hi>

                <p>BENNETT: Well by the time I went to that one year at Chapin, the school uniform,
                    which was bloomers which I guess came down to - well they didn't show under the
                    tunic, but wore a tunic over them. And when we played sports, the tunic came
                    off. But, even so. Actually I could never see there was anything the matter with
                    bloomers, they were very comfortable.</p>

                <p>SHORT PAUSE</p>
                <p>BENNETT: When the Dominican Republic had its revolution in '65, I was here for
                    the children's spring holidays. Almost everybody was evacuated. My one thought
                    was, one mustn't get in the State Department's hair. One must not rock the boat.
                    I was brought up that the men handled the business and the ladies stayed out of
                    it. And of course having family in this area, I did have a place to lay my weary
                    head. And I've realized since the Iranian Hostage Crisis and so forth, how much
                    I should have been doing and it is my profound regret that I didn't have the
                    wit, or the inclination, perhaps, but certainly not the wit to realize that it
                    was up to me do something to make the Department be sure that these people had a
                    place to stay and some funds. But I guess we have really, in explanation, we
                    hadn't really gotten used to these upheavals and these constant evacuations of
                    personnel. Nowadays it's a very different story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Part of that was tradition, though.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Oh, yes, and that's where my being, old, old Service comes in. Because
                    it would never occur to me, well, it was always very interesting because. . .
                    Well Eve Labouisse was always a doer and of course she wasn't Foreign Service
                    and she'd been a career woman in her own right. She used to feel that she and
                    Harry were a team and she would quite frequently go in the office and, I gather,
                    discuss policy to a certain extent. Certainly Tap would never have tolerated my
                    doing that. (laughs)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Labouisse a political?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>BENNETT: He was a political appointee. He'd been head of AID or UNRRA, I think.
                    And he went on after that to be the head of UNICEF. They were lovely people to
                    be with. Charming and so interesting. Eve Labouisse learned Greek. I thought I
                    was pretty good at languages, but she was fantastic and could speak so many more
                    than I could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So really it was part of our attitude toward the Service
                        in those days</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That we were just adjuncts and we had a role to play and
                        that was it. Interesting. They've come a long way, haven't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Yes. And I'm glad. I think Louisa Kennedy did the most superb job for
                    the wives in Iran when the hostage thing came up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was down in Brazil and really wasn't aware of her role
                        until I read the book that he wrote and she had a prologue in it. Tell me a
                        little bit about her contribution.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Well, I again didn't know too much about it. I was in and out at that
                    time, because we were still in NATO, but they'd been with us in Greece. I did
                    know her, and I heard and read in the papers and so forth and thought, well the
                    least I can do is to show solidarity. So I inquired how she was doing and asked
                    if she might come and have a cup of tea. She did. So she told me all about her
                    interview with Barbara Walters. She also said that she'd been over in Paris
                    doing an interview and that the Parisian television program people had not told
                    her that they were putting on a very pro-Khomeini type on the program with her.
                    I forget who was on it, but apparently the French audience response to her was
                    actually fantastic. She just told it like it was and they wrote in and said,
                    “Why can't you have more people like her?” Louisa is quite a person. I'm sorry
                    that we've lost them from the Service. I think that probably that was enough -
                    that experience.</p>
                <p>PAUSE</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you put that on tape, the way you view the role of
                        the wife of the ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>BENNETT: Well, I used to think that it really wasn't a wise idea to try to have
                    intimate friends. You have friends, yes, but you didn't unburden your soul at
                    any point to them because it was either going to reflect on your spouse's job or
                    on him or on your country or what have you. Or you could inadvertently let out
                    something that you shouldn't have. This, of course, was something that was
                    ingrained in me because my father would say, “Don't ever tell anybody your
                    opinion because people will attribute it to me.” So all my life I have not
                    expressed opinions on anything worthwhile until Tap retired. Now I have.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now you have a surfeit of them to unload. (laughter)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: And I notice that other people don't seem to have this approach, or
                    maybe they just use the word “friend” more loosely than I do. But that's one of
                    the things that I think is perhaps different in the Foreign Service from say, in
                    business, because in business you grow up with a lot of other wives in the same
                    levels so that I think you can keep them on. For instance - well, I don't know -
                    the President's wife and the President, they can keep their friends, but they
                    can't see as much of them as they did and I'm quite sure the relationship
                    changes enormously when they get in the White House. And it's the rare friend
                    who would be able to resist saying, “Oh well I was at the White House and the
                    President said . . .” And the President probably hasn't said anything that he
                    wouldn't to a newspaper reporter, but still.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's the same as an ambassador's wife. It's lonely.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: And your husband doesn't want to play favorites. At least I don't think
                    one should. Inevitably one does find some people more congenial than others or
                    else they don't have children and are therefore able to do things and so one
                    perhaps can take a trip here or do something like that. But one's always sort of
                    - at least I was - pretty conscious of the fact, “Well now we've done this with
                    the A's, we'd better pay attention to the B's.” (laughter)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But that's what keeps up good morale at posts. And makes
                        your job harder, really. Now whether that's going on these days or not, I
                        don't know.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>BENNETT: Well, as I say, it's a completely different thing. As the DCM's wife,
                    you don't quite have that. You're already getting a little lonelier, but you can
                    have friends. You're sort of primus inter pares among the counselors' wives and
                    you can have friends and perhaps play favorites a little bit more. As I say,
                    this whole business has changed so that I think now. . . Well, I remember when I
                    was complaining to Bob Woodwar[Robert Forbes Woodward was Ambassador to Costa
                    Rica, Uruguay, Chile and Spain, and was Assistant Secretary of State for
                    Inter-American Affairs] about the '72 ruling about not being asked - letting you
                    ask wives to do things. Bob said, “Well, I should think that would make life
                    simpler. There are always three or four who do all the work anyway, so you don't
                    have to bother with the others.” Well, that's a very clear-cut and pragmatic way
                    of looking at things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I always thought, too, that you should just assess what
                        you could do with the resources that you had.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Um-hum.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Although the administrative section and the GSOs (General
                        Service Officer) are doing a lot of the work that volunteer wives used to
                        do. And so it's really an added financial burden to the Foreign Service
                        because they're paying both US and host country national employees to do
                        things that we used to do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Well there you get onto my other bete noire which is that I feel this
                    business of paying separation allowances when it's the wife who's staying home
                    because she wants to pursue her career is the pits.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Absolutely, madness.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: That really infuriates me because I think it is encouraging separation
                    rather than . . . Instead of doing that, they ought to pay the wife to accompany
                    the husband. I think the Japanese have worked out the most sensible arrangement
                    on this where, I forget what the percentage is - it's not up to what the wife
                    would earn as a salary at home, but she would have some self-respect because she
                    is earning it and it's not paid to hubby, it's paid to her.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think we'll have to come to that eventually.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: But how you're ever going to compensate anybody on the basis of the
                    dinner parties they've given and whether they've told the servants or done it
                    themselves, this I don't understand.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think they're going to have to have a job description
                        for being a Foreign Service wife and pay — I mean you can't deduce who gives
                        the best dinner party, that's ridiculous. But I think they just have to
                        write a general job description, give the Foreign Service wife position a
                        bit more status and pay her a salary.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENNETT: Which wouldn't come to more than the separation allowance actually.
                    Except that there are exceptions to this. I know of one case where it's
                    literally the son's education. He's at the high school level and they don't know
                    whether they're going to be at the post for a year or not and so . . . And it's
                    not that she's trying to pursue a career either. She commutes back to the post
                    at every turn she gets. They aren't that well-heeled so she can't get backwards
                    and forwards very much. It's really a hardship on the whole family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And even one of the members of FLO told me that the
