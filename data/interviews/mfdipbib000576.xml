                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an interview under the auspices of the Association
                        for Diplomatic Studies with Ambassador John Wesley Jones. This took place at
                        DACOR Bacon House on Wednesday, May 11, 1988. The interviewer was Horace G.
                        Torbert.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Ambassador Jones, I would appreciate it if you would start out by telling us
                    maybe a little about how you first got interested in foreign affairs and how you
                    came to be in the Foreign Service. And then go on, as you feel comfortable, with
                    a more or less chronological account of the posts you served in, and what you
                    did in them and what the relations of the United States were with those
                    countries during your time there.</p>
                <p>JONES: When I was a junior, I think, in Sioux City Central High School, the
                    registrar of the high school had been a clerk in the American embassy in Paris
                    during the First World War. She took a fancy to me and talked to me about the
                    Foreign Service and suggested that I might think about it as a career. Then also
                    a maiden aunt, a sister of my father, thought this would be a great career so
                    she encouraged me in it, too. So for the last two years of high school and my
                    four years in college, I determined that that's the career I wanted to
                    follow.</p>
                <p>For my last two years in college, I persuaded my father to send me to Washington,
                    DC since in Sioux City, Iowa not many people knew much about the Foreign Service
                    and I thought that perhaps in Washington I would learn more about it. Because of
                    my father's religious prejudices, I knew that it was useless to ask him to send
                    me to the Foreign Service school at Georgetown run by Jesuits, but I learned
                    that George Washington University had received that year a grant of a million
                    dollars to establish a foreign service school. The Masonic Lodge was apparently
                    worried about the influence of the Jesuits on the future of Foreign Service
                    Officers and decided they would like to have a foreign school in a non-religious
                    university.</p>
                <p>So I enrolled at G.W. as a junior in 1928 and graduated in 1930 in liberal arts,
                    took the Foreign Service examinations the summer of 1930 here in Washington. On
                    the 31st of December I received a letter in Sioux City, Iowa telling me that I
                    had not only passed the Foreign Service exams but that also my appointment as a
                    career Foreign Service Officer had been approved by the Senate.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's great. Had you had the oral exam, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Yes, I had taken the oral. I stayed in Washington for the oral exam rather
                    than going back out home.</p>
                <p>So it was a matter of great rejoicing. The new year came in, January, 1931, and I
                    had orders to proceed to a post in northern Mexico for my neophyte training. In
                    those days, Foreign Service Officers went first to a post abroad and then
                    returned for their schooling in the Foreign Service School. So I left Sioux City
                    on the 10th of January, 1931, and with four layovers en route and five days
                    travel, I finally arrived in Saltillo, Mexico, which is the capital of the state
                    of Coahuila. The principal officer there was Samuel Sokobin, who had served.
                    ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you spell Sokobin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: S-o-k-o-b-i-n. He was a Chinese language officer and had served the first
                    14 years of his service in China. The Department, deciding that he needed a
                    change, had made him principal Officer of this small consulate in northern
                    Mexico.</p>
                <p>Saltillo is 150 miles straight up the mountain from Monterrey, which is much
                    better known. Monterrey, which is something like 1500 feet above sea level,
                    Saltillo was a mile high, over 5000 feet. Beautiful small, colonial town.
                    Charming place to be stationed for the first time abroad.</p>
                <p>Mr. Sokobin was a very thoughtful and helpful principal officer who insisted that
                    I read all incoming and outgoing dispatches, some of them confidential, which
                    was the highest classification, I assume, that the consulate ever received. And
                    also that every morning for half an hour, he and I would read the Consular
                    Regulations which was a rather formidable tome in those days. It was a splendid
                    introduction. My salary was $2500 a year. My rental allowance was $50 a month
                    and I had a post allowance to adjust my official salary to living expenses, of
                    $200 a year. So I wrote to my family that when all of my food and lodging had
                    been paid at the local hotel, I had spent only $40 a month out of my salary to
                    maintain myself. That included my laundry and mending. I felt so affluent in
                    those dark days in the midst of the Depression that I opened a bank account in
                    the local Mexican bank and even had enough money left over to help my brother
                    through school at Iowa State University at Ames. In late August, a telegram came
                    signed “Castle, Acting Secretary” transferring me to the Foreign Service School
                    in Washington on the 15th of September.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>I left with great sadness, many friends. The young Mexicans there who were my age
                    had all, most of them, gone to school in the States so that I learned very
                    little Spanish, since they all spoke excellent English and were delighted to
                    have a chance to continue using their English in talking to me.</p>
                <p>After three months in the State Department in the fall of 1931, I was assigned to
                    Calcutta, India. I went home for Christmas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we get that, let's just ask you, what was your
                        actual function in Saltillo? Were you issuing visas or. ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Oh. As Vice Consul, I issued visas to Mexicans wanting to go to the United
                    States. But also we had consular invoices which were issued to exporters of lead
                    from the local lead mine to the United States. And I think probably that the
                    major portion of the consular fees were collected from these invoices — there
                    was a local mine run by an English company and they exported lead to the United
                    States. They had to get a consular invoice before they could ship it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I just wanted to get that much so we could get. ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: So it was mostly consular invoices and visas and a small American colony
                    with passports, requiring services.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now we were about to go to Calcutta, you said you were
                        assigned to Calcutta.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Yes. I arrived in September at the Foreign Service School and, after 3
                    months went to Sioux City for Christmas, knowing that I had already been
                    assigned to Calcutta. In early January 1932, I proceeded to New York, where I
                    got one of the American Export Line ships to Alexandria, Egypt. In Alexandria
                    the Consul there had received instructions to purchase a ticket for me to
                    proceed on to Calcutta. He confessed to me later that he had misunderstood “the
                    first available vessel” and had bought mea ticket on a German freighter rather
                    than waiting for the Peninsular and Oriental steamship line which most
                    passengers took from Alexandria to Bombay. So I had a very interesting trip as
                    the only passenger on a German freighter through the Suez Canal. We stopped at
                    Aden; our next stop was in Ceylon, at Columbo. Tommy Thompson — Llewellyn
                    Thompson, was the U.S. Vice Consul in Columbo then. And since the ship was in
                    port there for three days he kindly showed me around Columbo and I had a very
                    pleasant and agreeable stay.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>And then the ship went on, the freighter went on, to Madras and there I met the
                    Consular Officer in Madras and had two days there and finally arrived in
                    Calcutta on the 22nd of February 1932. I think that I expended probably the
                    maximum allowed by the Department in those days sailing to a new post, which was
                    45 days.</p>
                <p>In Calcutta the Principal Officer was Arthur G. Frost and Gerald Keith was the
                    Principal Vice Consul. Dorsey Fisher was there as a Vice Consul. And I think I
                    was the Junior Vice Consul, well I obviously was, when I arrived on the 22nd of
                    February 1932. In Calcutta my job was double, number one, to issue visas to
                    Indians wishing to visit or migrate to the United States. And, number two, the
                    growing American colony in Calcutta required passport services. I stayed first
                    at the Grand Hotel on Chowringhee and then eventually moved into a house with
                    Fritz Jandrey and Russ Engdahl when they appeared as Vice Consuls in
                    Calcutta.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fritz Jandrey and who else did you say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Russ Engdahl, E-n-g-d-a-h-l.</p>
                <p>We adopted the British custom of calling the house a chummery because there were
                    many bachelors, principally English, in Calcutta in those days and they couldn't
                    afford apartments by themselves, so they took houses. Our house was quite an
                    elegant place, but it was still called a chummery. There were four of us by that
                    time, including Wilson Flake, then an Assistant Trade Commissioner.</p>
                <p>I spent three years in Calcutta and at the end of my three-year tour I either had
                    to pay my own way home or wait until the Department decided to transfer me to
                    another post. So on my salary I had saved up enough money to buy a ticket on a
                    freighter from Calcutta to Manila. I bought a ticket on a Dutch freighter this
                    time which took me around Southeast Asia en route to the Philippines. We stopped
                    in Singapore where I first met Harrison Lewis, colleague of mine, same class;
                    and then on to Hong Kong where Donald Dunham was the Vice Consul; and finally to
                    the Philippines, where Bart Richards, former Assistant Trade Commissioners in
                    Calcutta, was then stationed. After four or five days in the Philippines, I took
                    an American passenger boat to San Francisco and then finally arrived in Sioux
                    City, Iowa by train four days later.</p>
                <p>It was while I was in Sioux City that I learned that the Department needed a Vice
                    Consul in Rome, Italy. And since I was still on my own, I had to pay my way to
                    Washington to pick up my official orders. Only from Washington was my travel
                    paid to New York to board an American Export Line ship to Naples.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>I arrived in Rome 1935, June. And I remember taking a taxi from the railroad
                    station up the Via Veneto to the Consulate in the building next to the Palazzo
                    Margherita. I couldn't believe the beauty of the city. After three years in
                    Calcutta, to arrive in a place like Rome was like going from Hades to Paradise.
                    In Rome the Principal Officer was Graham Kemper and his assistant was Gilson
                    Blake. I was the Vice Consul in charge of immigration for Italians going to the
                    United States, passports for Americans, and registration of the large American
                    colony living in Rome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned the Palazzo Margherita. Was that at that
                        time the American Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the Consulate was where it is today?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: The Consulate was where it is today. And the great building back of it,
                    which is now. ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: USIA, or it was the last time I was there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: On the other side of the garden. That was the chancery of the American
                    Embassy. The Ambassador was William Phillips. Harold Tittmann was the Counselor
                    of the Embassy and Sam Reber was one of the Second or Third Secretaries at the
                    Embassy. I was a Vice Consul, I did Vice Consular work, registration of
                    Americans living in Rome, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time was there still a, legally of course the
                        Consular Service and the Diplomatic Service were united, but was there still
                        somewhat of a separation in attitude between the people who did consular
                        work and people who did, quote, pure diplomatic work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Oh, very much. Yes. The Consular Service, most of the people in the
                    Consular Service, including my boss, had come up through the Consular cone. I
                    fully expected that that's what I would continue in my career. But I became a
                    very good friend of Sam Reber, who was in the Embassy across the garden. There
                    were some very attractive young women in the American colony in Rome, some of
                    them half Italian, half American, so we had a very pleasant and agreeable social
                    life. It was in Rome that I met my wife, who was the daughter of the Assistant
                    Naval Attach� at that time.</p>
                <p>

                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>JONES: That was during this period, yes.</p>
                <p>Trying to remember, now — I was entitled to home leave during this period but I
                    think while payment of home leave travel had gone into effect, those stationed
                    in Europe were the last to benefit from this limited allotment so that those of
                    us stationed in Europe still had to pay our own home leave back and forth. I
                    went home in 1938 and there Kitty and I were married in Annapolis at St. Ann's.
                    We came back to Rome in the summer of 1938 and continued living in my charming
                    apartment on the Via Nomentana, corner of Via Massawa, across from the great
                    house, the Villa Blanca where Alexander Kirk had lived as the Minister Counselor
                    of our Embassy.</p>
                <p>During this whole period, of course, Mussolini was the virtual dictator, Prime
                    Minister, of Italy; King Victor Emmanuel II was the monarch. I was still in Rome
                    in 1938, '39, when Neville Chamberlain made his famous trip — '38, was it? —
                    famous trip to Munich and came out with the famous statement, “Peace in our
                    time.” And I must confess that we were all relieved, those of us stationed
                    abroad. We had seen war pressing down, or the threats of war, with Hitler's
                    continued move first into Austria and then into other parts of Europe. So we
                    were all very reassured by this; that we would indeed have peace in our
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As Immigration Officer, did you run into the Jewish
                        immigration problem at that time? Did that center in Rome at all? Were there
                        a lot of refugee Jews who. ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Yes. Yes, there were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And did this become a major problem in Rome, as it was in
                        some other places?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Yes, there was a great deal of work and a great deal of research that had
                    to be done. Enrico Fermi was one of the Italians of the Jewish faith who came
                    and applied for a visa to go to the United States. I gave it to him and of
                    course Enrico Fermi meant nothing to me in those days. But it's only been since,
                    that I have seen what prominence he played as a scientist in this country and
                    the important role he has played in the development atomic energy, that I really
                    realized that I did indeed perform a useful service in giving a visa to Enrico
                    Fermi. And I'm sure there were many others who came to this country and who have
                    made a great contribution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you left, however, before the war actually
                        started?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: No. We were in Rome in 1940 when Mussolini declared war on France. The
                    gesture that Winston Churchill described as a stab in the back of their poor
                    ally, France. In 1940 our first child was born in Rome. In 1941 I had been in
                    Italy almost six years.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>Sam Reber had left the Embassy and gone back to the State Department and had
                    become the Italian Desk Officer. Because of the war and because of the refugees
                    and because of Mussolini's increasing association with Hitler, the Vatican and
                    Italian Desk needed an assistant. So with eternal thanks to Sam Reber, he asked
                    for me to be transferred from Rome and from the Consular Service to the State
                    Department as his assistant on the Italian Desk. In order to get out of Italy in
                    those days, we had to go — the British had blockaded the Mediterranean, so it
                    was impossible for us to sail from an Italian port to Gibraltar to get a ship to
                    the United States. So we took a train north through northern Italy and across
                    southern France, which was then Vichy France. Isn't that correct?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, certainly. By that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Finally when we got into Spain, which was neutral, for the first time we
                    had real bread and real coffee, after living on ersatz, (very scarce and strange
                    looking bread) in Italy ever since 1940 when the war had started.</p>
                <p>Then eventually we traveled by train across Spain and across Portugal where the
                    bread and the coffee were even better. When we got to Lisbon we boarded an
                    American ship on which we sailed to the United States. Of course this long train
                    trip through Italy and across southern France and across Spain and across into
                    Portugal, which I think took all together 10 days or two weeks, we had a child
                    who was less than a year old. So my wife had very thoughtfully had a crib of
                    straw made which we put in the train compartment on the seat on the other side
                    of us and the baby lived and slept and ate. ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For ten days.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: ... there, for ten days. And I can remember when we got to Portugal and
                    some of our colleagues said, oh, that poor baby, how did he survive the trip?
                    I'm afraid my reaction was not very paternal. I said, poor baby, hell, how did
                    we survive? Because we had to fix the baby food and heat the milk on little
                    Sterno stoves and all kinds of things. And the baby never had it so good.</p>
                <p>Anyway, that was the end of my first Roman tour. During that period, of course,
                    while I was in the Consulate and had nothing to do with the diplomatic side of
                    our relations, William Phillips continued to be the Ambassador. But I did leave
                    before Pearl Harbor so that I got out on my own free will and was not interned,
                    as were William Phillips and the other members of the Embassy following December
                    7, 1941.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then did you go immediately to work on the Italian
                        desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: I think I was given a month's leave. So I took my wife and child out to
                    Sioux City, Iowa to introduce them to my family and then came back and we found
                    a house in the blueprint stage in Alexandria, Virginia, three-story rowhouse in
                    Yates Gardens. Since I had no money, still living on a rather meager Vice
                    Consul's salary — or perhaps by this time I had been promoted to the rank of
                    Consul, and I was no longer unclassified, I think I was FSO-8 — my wife had a
                    dowry of $1,000 from her grandmother in Puerto Rico so I used that as a down
                    payment on the house. The cost of the house was $7,500. Within a few months we
                    moved into this house and lived there. I commuted from Alexandria to the State
                    Department for the next four years.</p>
                <p>In the State Department I helped Sam on the Italian Desk and then we established
                    a Vatican Desk, because Harold Tittmann was stationed there as the assistant to
                    the first U.S. representative to the Vatican, Myron Taylor. Myron Taylor would
                    go there occasionally as President Roosevelt's Representative, but the Resident
                    Representative there was Harold Tittmann, career Foreign Service Officer, who
                    had formerly been in the American Embassy in Rome. We needed a Desk Officer for
                    the Vatican so I assisted Sam as the Assistant Desk Officer for the Vatican and
                    Italy. Then eventually Sam moved over to be Desk Officer for France and Belgium,
                    etc. So I then became the Desk Officer for Italy and the Vatican, in which
                    positions I served until the end of the war, 1945.</p>
                <p>But during that period there was a reorganization in the Department and something
                    called Southern European Affairs was established with a Director and it was
                    separated from Western European Affairs. Cavendish Cannon was the Director of
                    that new Division.. Because Italy was in South Europe, Italy came under that
                    Southern European designation,-Division-which included the Balkans. So Cavendish
                    Cannon was my boss up until my reassignment to Italy in 1945, after I had
                    completed four years in the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was after the end of the war that you went back to
                        Italy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Yes. We went over on a troop ship to Italy because there was no regular
                    passenger ship service. There was great doubt whether or not my wife should
                    accompany me since she was pregnant, but I finally persuaded the Department
                    medical staff to let her. She did not want to stay in Alexandria (Virginia) with
                    two children, awaiting a third without me, so we all sailed off together and
                    arrived in Naples in early July 1945. Of course the war in the Far East was
                    still going on and the war in Europe had been over a very short time, only since
                    May. We arrived back in Rome to find it really quite a shattered and unfamiliar
                    city.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your assignment? What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>JONES: I was assigned to Rome as First Secretary of the Embassy in charge of the
                    Political Section. By that time the Embassy was in the Palazzo Margherita.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I think we got that right after the war.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Right after the war. I'm not quite sure when that happened, but when I
                    went back the Political Section was on the second floor of the Palazzo
                    Margherita, facing the building off to the left, looking out over the old
                    Consular building. The Ambassador was Alexander Kirk. Does that seem right?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That seems quite, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: And David Key was the Charg� d'Affaires. And I was head of the Political
                    Section as First Secretary.</p>
                <p>I must confess that I believe that Umberto was the — I'd have to go back and
                    check my notes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was still King briefly until the Republic.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Yes, he was no longer the Prince Regent, I believe. I'm not quite sure
                    about the date. But I think that he was then the King. What, was he King Umberto
                    II?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. I don't recall the dates, but they voted,-held a
                        plebiscite-on the monarchy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Oh, yes. That was during the time that I was there. And we were very much
                    in favor of having a plebiscite on the future form of government. But when I got
                    there, I was there during the elections for Prime Minister. And King Umberto was
                    still the King. Togliatti was head of the Italian Communist Party. There was
                    great concern indeed, because of the strong influence of the Soviet Union in
                    Europe in those days, that the Communist Party might win. To the great joy and
                    satisfaction of all of us, Alcide de Gasperi won the elections with the
                    Christian Democrats and became the first Prime Minister under the King.</p>
                <p>Then it was during that period of de Gasperi's premiership that a plebiscite was
                    held on whether or not the Italians wanted to have a republic or continue with
                    the monarchy. There was a resounding victory in favor of a republic and opposed
                    to the monarchy. So King Umberto and the Queen left with good grace and
                    proceeded, I think, to Switzerland. But that's a matter of history.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>The first presidential elections were held and Luigi Einaudi was elected the
                    first President of the new Republic of Italy and moved into the Palazzo
                    Quirinale.</p>
                <p>By the way, this is an aside. One of his sons is a professor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At Cornell, I think, or was at Cornell. He may be
                        somewhere else.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: He's somewhere else now because I've seen him a couple of times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think maybe he's at George Washington [University]
                        now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: It may be that I've seen him at George Washington a couple of times and
                    have told him about my experience in Italy during the time that his father was
                    elected.</p>
                <p>Well, those were obviously very exciting days. They're all well recorded in
                    history so I don't know that there's anything that I can particularly add to
                    that. Jimmy Dunn succeeded Alexander Kirk as Ambassador in Rome and was there
                    during all of the rest of the period that I was stationed in the Embassy in
                    Rome.</p>
                <p>In 1948 after three years in Rome I was transferred to Nanking, China. This of
                    course came as a great surprise to me and to most of the old China hands. But I
                    learned when I got back to the Department that some of my old friends in EUR
                    felt that Johnny Jones had been in Italy long enough, practically since
                    1935-from 1935 to 1941-then four years on the Italian Desk in the Department,
                    and then back in Italy again for another three years, so all together it was
                    about 13 years of unbroken Italian service. So they decided that I should have a
                    change. Also, there was an effort in China to resist a Communist takeover with
                    the increasing Communist influence there. It was felt that someone who had lived
                    through the defeat of Togliatti in the elections in Italy in the 1940s might be
                    a useful member of the staff to point out all the dangers and difficulties of
                    permitting China to become another Communist power.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And also you'd had some China training from your first
                        boss, perhaps.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Not really. No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's interesting. Could Kitty go with you there-to
                        China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Oh, yes. Because the Communists were still off in the west. All of the
                    east coast of China was under the control of Chiang Kai-shek and his
                    government.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>We were given home leave en route to China in 1948 and for at least one month my
                    wife and three children and I visited my family in Sioux City. My mother was
                    still living there and my brother and his wife were there and were our hosts.
                    Then we proceeded by train to San Francisco and then from San Francisco took a
                    ship — Dollar Line, I think it was, from San Francisco to Shanghai. In Shanghai
                    we were met by Jack Cabot, who was the Consul General in those days, put on a
                    train and proceeded to Nanking which was the capital of the Nationalist
                    government in 1948.</p>
                <p>Dr. Leighton Stuart was the Ambassador there in those days and Lewis Clark was
                    the Minister Counselor of the Embassy. We were promptly moved into very
                    attractive quarters of the Embassy compound just across the road from the
                    Ambassador's residence and the residence of the Minister Counselor, Lewis Clark.
                    Our next door neighbor in the Embassy compound was Livingston Merchant and his
                    wife, Betty. Livy was the Counselor of the Economic Section and I was head of
                    the Political Section.</p>
                <p>However, in December of 1948 the Communists under Mao Zedong captured Peking
                    where we had a Consulate General. And when this happened the Ambassador felt so
                    concerned about the wives and children and about the imminent danger of Nanking
                    as the next target of the Communist army that he ordered all wives and children
                    to be evacuated to the Philippines. So within a very short time Kitty and the
                    three children flew in a C-47 with the other wives and children to the
                    Philippines where they were stationed in a kind of temporary camp on the grounds
                    of the Philippine University. I visited them there Christmas of '48 and realized
                    that they were not very comfortable living in rather cramped refugee quarters.
                    My wife always referred to the place disparagingly as Camp P.U.</p>
                <p>In any event, in January I was still in Nanking in the Embassy. My wife's family
                    (my father-in-law was with IT&amp;T after his retirement from the Marine Corps)
                    had been transferred to Rome, so my wife and children sailed back to Rome to
                    join her parents in Italy and I was left in the Orient by myself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had to keep Jones in Rome as much as possible.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: That's right. That was a long, difficult summer for me. Finally in August
                    of 1949 Ambassador Leighton Stuart was evacuated, went out on a military plane
                    back to the U.S.-Lewis Clark had moved with the government to Canton, which was
                    where Chiang Kai-shek had established his government when the Communist armies
                    kept moving nearer and nearer to Nanking. So while I was not the Charg�
                    d'Affaires, Lewis Clark was the Charg� d'Affaires in Canton, I was in charge of
                    what was left of the Embassy in Nanking after August 1, 1949.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>I'm sorry I don't have my dates straight but I think it must have been in April
                    of '49, I was there when the Communists took Nanking. To my astonishment, the
                    Nationalist government had all left so that for 24 or 48 hours, (first time in
                    my life) we were a city without any authority, no one to appeal to. By that time
                    I had moved into Lewis Clark's former house in the Embassy compound, where the
                    Ambassador's residence was as well. That was fairly well walled-around, a well
                    fortressed, well protected compound, and we still had some of the Marine guard
                    with us. The thing that was the greatest danger was not the incoming Communist
                    troops who had already crossed the Yangtze, but looters. I remember standing on
                    the high ground just inside the Embassy compound wall looking out over the city
                    of Nanking and being horrified at all of the fires that had been set, most of
                    them in empty houses belonging to officials of the Chiang Kai-shek government
                    who had fled to Canton leaving their houses with some provisions and some
                    furniture but empty and unoccupied. And after the local populace had ravaged
                    these houses and looted them, they then set fire to them. We were advised by
                    someone who had lived through incidents like this formerly in the Far East that
                    the best way to keep looters away was to assure them that the place was occupied
                    and that there were firearms inside. So, every 15 minutes or every half hour or
                    whenever it seemed appropriate, the Marine guards would shoot their guns off
                    into the air to let prospective looters know that this was not a place that was
                    easy to attack. Because it was occupied and because it was armed, we were really
                    never in any danger of looters coming near because they had so many other
                    unoccupied places that they could go to. I never would have thought that I would
                    welcome the advent of Communist troops into a city where I was living, but I can
                    assure you that it was with some joy that I saw the Communist troops come into
                    Nanking the next day. Order was very quickly restored.</p>
                <p>It was possible for me, after a few days, to go out and go to the Chancery, which
                    was outside the Embassy compound, and to continue to conduct business there. I
                    used to walk back and forth to the Chancery during the days that the Communists
                    were in occupation there, never with any concern or fear from local populace or
                    from them.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you establish some sort of a relationship with the
                        commanding officer of the Communist groups? Or was it just a stand-off, so
                        to speak.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: It was a stand-off. No, I did not. Because we were still accredited to the
                    government of Chiang Kai-shek so therefore I did not have instructions other
                    than on local or personal basis to be in touch with the local military group,
                    who were there in charge.</p>
                <p>This was in April, I think I said.</p>

                <p>JONES: April of '49, yes, that was when the Communists took Nanking. And in
                    September I received orders to report to the Department of State. I'm sorry,
                    Tully, forgive me. I'm going to have to think about this a little bit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things that seems very interesting to me about
                        this period is what did you do to keep yourself from going crazy during this
                        time when you had no relations with anybody and in a sense not much work to
                        do other than housekeeping?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: We had a much smaller staff, of course, by this time because most of the
                    staff had been taken by Lewis Clark to Canton. But we did have enough of a staff
                    to keep this little section and what was left of the Embassy in Nanking going
                    and what we did was report. And we were permitted, interestingly enough, to send
                    out coded messages and to continue to use our communications system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this your own radio facility in those days or did they
                        go out over commercial wires?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Tully, I think they went out over commercial wires. I must confess that I
                    don't remember. This is probably written someplace in my letters home which I
                    will read someday. [N.B. the U.S. and British Embassies in Nanking had their own
                    radio facilities so they did not use commercial wires] But we were permitted to
                    continue to communicate with Shanghai and with Canton and with the Department on
                    what was developing in this area and what our British and French and Italian
                    colleagues were doing. As the Communists moved south and took over Shanghai and
                    then moved on toward Hong Kong, the Department decided that it should close its
                    mission in Nanking and this decision was taken along with most of our allies,
                    including the British government and the Italian government. So an evacuation
                    ship was sent into Shanghai and most of us, the American Embassy and the British
                    Embassy — Leo Lamb was the British Charg� d'Affaires, and the Italian
                    Ambassador, Sergio Fenoaltea, and his staff, we all went out on the same train
                    to Shanghai to board the evacuation ship which was sent there for all of the
                    Western diplomats.</p>
                <p>I can remember when I went to the Chinese Communist authorities in Nanking to get
                    passage from the country and my train ticket to Shanghai, I showed them my
                    diplomatic passport and I said that I was the American Charg� d'Affaires in
                    Nanking. And they said, we don't recognize you as the Charg� d'Affaires. We do
                    not recognize your government or any of its officials. But we will give you a
                    permit, a pass, as an American citizen living in China, to get to Shanghai. So I
                    left Nanking as Mr. Jones, as a non-official of the U.S. government.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>When we got to Shanghai we still had a Consulate General there; they had not all
                    been evacuated, some of their staff went out with us. I'm afraid I don't
                    remember the name of the ship now but in any event we went on an evacuation ship
                    to Hong Kong, which was still untouched and still a British colony. The first
                    class on the ship was for the Chiefs of Mission. Since I was the Charg�
                    d'Affaires in Nanking and Leo Lamb was the Charge of the British Embassy, we and
                    the Italian Ambassador were all put in one cabin which I think had four bunks.
                    So first class was four bunks and the poor Third Secretaries and Vice Consuls
                    were down in the hold of the ship. I went down once and decided I never wanted
                    to go down again. When I got back up, I couldn't really complain about four to a
                    cabin.</p>
                <p>In any event, it was not a very long trip and when we got to Hong Kong we were
                    welcomed there by. ...</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONES: Yes. And I know his name perfectly well, but. ...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We can look that up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: I stayed in Hong Kong long enough to arrange my travel to Italy because I
                    wanted to join my family there. I believe that my home leave orders covered
                    enough of my travel ticket that I was able to pay for the rest of it to join my
                    family. I arrived in Rome at the airport on October 3, 1949.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By this time you could travel by commercial air.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Yes. By commercial air from Hong Kong to Rome. That's right. It was one of
                    the first trips I had ever made by air, probably; I hadn't thought of that.
                    While there I learned at the Embassy that, by the grace of God, they needed a
                    First Secretary in Madrid. So I was transferred again from Hell to Heaven-from
                    Nanking to Madrid. I was ordered back to the Department for briefing. My family
                    then would travel directly from Italy to Madrid to meet me there when I
                    arrived.</p>
                <p>After briefings at the Spanish Desk in the Department, I arrived in Rome in
                    November of 1949.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Arrived in Madrid.</hi>

                <p>JONES: I'm sorry, forgive me. Arrived in Madrid in November of 1949. By the grace
                    of God, within a few minutes I learned, after I got there, that my wife and
                    children were arriving, shortly, by plane from Rome. So I just waited at the
                    airport for their arrival and we had a wonderful family reunion at the airport
                    in Madrid, and from there proceeded to the. ...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Palace, the Ritz?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: No. Tully, it was that nice little hotel not very far from the Embassy.
                    Oh. In any event, the hotel had the same name as the street and it was within
                    walking distance of the Embassy. [Hotel Velazquez on Calle Velasquez]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can't remember what the name of it is. It's
                        terrible.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Yes. But in any event, that's where we stayed at the beginning. Just let
                    me think a little bit about Madrid.</p>
                <p>In those days we had no Ambassador because we had broken relations, no, we had
                    withdrawn our Ambassador from Spain over protests with Franco's alliance with
                    the Axis powers. So Paul Culbertson was the Charg� d'Affaires and I was the
                    First Secretary in the Embassy in charge of the Political Section. Paul and
                    Maria Culbertson were living in that beautiful residence on Ramon de la Cruz,
                    which is now the residence of the Minister Counselor of the Embassy.</p>
                <p>It was an interesting time and I began taking Spanish lessons immediately. It was
                    a difficult transition from Italian to Spanish. Of course in those days we had
                    to take our lessons outside of office hours so that I had to have my lesson from
                    8 to 9 before the Embassy opened. Considering Madrid social hours, it was
                    difficult to be available and to be. ...</p>

                <p>JONES: He was wonderful and taught me wonderful Castilian Spanish.</p>
                <p>It was very interesting, delightful time. Paul and Maria were still there, I
                    think, when it was decided to re-establish full diplomatic relations with the
                    Spanish government. By that time we had moved out of the hotel and into what was
                    then quite a far out residential area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Colonia del Viso?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Colonia del Viso, thank you very much. We rented a house there, fully
                    furnished, from Spaniards and lived there until the first Ambassador arrived.
                    The first Ambassador was — I've just thought of his name.</p>
                <p>After the re-establishment of full diplomatic relations, the first Ambassador to
                    be appointed by the U.S. government to Madrid was Stanton Griffis, a retired
                    Director of MGM and a most interesting man. He had served as Ambassador in
                    Poland and also in Buenos Aires. So this was not his first ambassadorial post.
                    But he left a great deal of the running of the Embassy to me since I was by that
                    time, with Paul Culbertson's departure, I was the Counselor and number two in
                    the Embassy. Because Stanton Griffis was unmarried he was very thoughtful and
                    kind to my wife and always, in official functions, treated her as his
                    hostess.</p>
                <p>He was accompanied by Angie and Margaret Duke. Angie Duke is Angier Biddle Duke,
                    who later had a very interesting career in the Foreign Service himself. But the
                    Dukes were brought along by Stanton Griffis to be his immediate assistants, one
                    on the social side and Angie on the diplomatic side. They both lived with the
                    Ambassador in the Embassy residence.</p>
                <p>The Ambassador did not like the house on Ramon de la Cruz. He thought it was too
                    small for him, so he persuaded the Department to give him a rental allowance. He
                    rented another palacio, the name of which I have forgotten, not very far from
                    the Chancery and that's where he lived in great style with the Dukes. The Ramon
                    de la Cruz house was standing empty. And since the U.S. owned it, I asked the
                    Ambassador if he minded if I lived in it, move my family into it? He said no
                    problem at all. Since it was furnished, Kitty and I with our children left the
                    house in del Viso and moved into that beautiful residence on Ramon de la Cruz
                    and spent the rest of our Spanish tour there.</p>

                <p>Stanton Griffis was in Spain less than a year. I think he became rather bored
                    with it. He was succeeded by Lincoln MacVeagh who had been our Ambassador in
                    Portugal. When President Eisenhower was elected, Lincoln MacVeagh, who had been
                    a firm supporter and favorite of Democratic Presidents Roosevelt and Truman,
                    submitted his resignation as Ambassador. It was accepted by the new President,
                    which I think was a great blow and shock to MacVeagh. He went into retirement
                    back in Portugal in a villa near Estoril. So then Jimmy Dunn was appointed
                    Ambassador to Spain. Since I had the great pleasure and fortune of serving under
                    Jimmy Dunn twice, I just wanted to be sure that I had it in proper context
                    chronologically. Thus succeeding Lincoln MacVeagh, Jimmy Dunn, who had been in
                    Rome for quite a long while, was transferred as Ambassador to Madrid. I
                    continued to serve him until 1953. In 1953 Homer Byington, who was the Director
                    of Western European Affairs in the State Department, arranged with me and
                    persuaded the Department to transfer him to Madrid to be Jimmy Dunn's Minister
                    Counselor, and to transfer me from Madrid to Washington to be the new Director
                    of Western European Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Smart man. Before we go into that, could you give me just
                        a few words on what was engaging your time during the latter part of — I
                        know what was engaging your time earlier on, it was breaking in new
                        Ambassadors and that sort of thing and doing the reporting that we did. But
                        you must have gotten by that time into the period when we were negotiating
                        treaties for bases and what not in Madrid. Were you engaged in that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: You're absolutely right. That was what I was principally engaged in, and
                    the Political Section was particularly engaged in negotiating with the Spaniards
                    a base agreement. They are tough negotiators. We were constantly receiving
                    instructions from the State Department. But the fact that the Spaniards were
                    interested in negotiating a base agreement with us was of course very
                    encouraging and rather a change in their normal diplomatic relations with the
                    rest of Europe and with the United States. So we did indeed negotiate a base
                    agreement, and Jimmy Dunn was then the Ambassador. When I was transferred back
                    to the State Department in March of 1953, I believe it was, the day that we
                    sailed from Gibraltar was the day that the base agreement was signed in Madrid
                    between the Ambassador and the Spanish Foreign Minister. So I left with a sense
                    of real accomplishment. While I wasn't there for the signing ceremony, I did
                    know, the day that I sailed home that the agreement had finally been signed and
                    that we had a base agreement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the agreement, the actual negotiation done by the
                        Embassy or did they send out a special negotiating team or something for
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: No. As I remember, the negotiations were done by the Embassy. But of
                    course the Attach�s.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Military attach�s?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Exactly. The military attach�s were very much involved in it. But the
                    negotiations were done by Jimmy Dunn and by the political and the military
                    staffs in his Embassy. That I think was probably the most important thing that
                    we did during that period. Our relations with the Spanish government were
                    friendly and we were received by Franco with considerable respect. Having had
                    three Ambassadors there during the time that I was the Charg� d'Affaires, I was
                    privileged to ride with each new Ambassador in the open coach with horses to the
                    Palace. ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: El Pardo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: El Pardo, to accompany the Ambassador in presenting his credentials. Each
                    time we were received by Franco. So ceremonially and politically it was a very
                    interesting time for a Charg� d'Affaires to be stationed in Madrid in the late
                    '40s and early '50s. I was there four years, from the end of 1949 to September
                    of 1953.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It says here that you were assigned to the Department in
                        November of '53.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: I think so. I got to the Department in '53 I feel sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, it was '53.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: In the Fall of '53.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. Then you came to the Department and took over
                        the Office of Western European Affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: That's right. My Deputy was Bill Tyler who had been stationed in our
                    Embassy in Paris.</p>
                <p>JONES: I shouldn't say what Bill's assignment was before he came, but in any
                    event, my background had been Spanish and Italian and his background had been
                    French and Northern Europe. So I pretty much handled, continued my interest in
                    Spanish/Italian and Balkan affairs and Bill handled most of the things that had
                    to do with France and the Benelux countries in the North. Because Bill had been
                    educated in England, also of course his relations and knowledge of England was a
                    very great help.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONES: That's right. So in a way it turned out that we were a fairly good
                    combination. It was a very interesting period from 1953 to 1958. I will not try
                    to recall all of the important and interesting things that happened during that
                    time, but I believe. ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Certainly you continued your Italian relationship as well
                        as your Spanish relationship.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Yes. Also, that was the period of the formation of the great organizations
                    of Europe. NATO was being formed and the military alliance of Western Europe was
                    being formed at that time. So it was really a very interesting and in a sense
                    gratifying, satisfactory time to see the recovery of Europe in the '50s and the
                    part that the United States had had to play in it. And the continuing trend
                    toward unification of Western Europe with all of the various community
                    organizations that were established at that time, including the military.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was also of course in a way the dissolution of empire

                <p>JONES: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you, as I recall it, towards the end of that period
                        you moved up to be Deputy Assistant Secretary for a year or so, didn't
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Yes, when Livy Merchant left, to go to Canada as Ambassador, Burke Elbrick
                    became the Assistant Secretary for European Affairs. And he asked me to move up
                    and be a Deputy Assistant Secretary for European Affairs in, I think, my last
                    year, let's say about 1957. But it might have been 1956. During that time of
                    course I had an interest in all of European Affairs, which was the most
                    interesting and satisfactory assignment.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>I was then, by the grace of God and thanks to President Eisenhower and Secretary
                    Dulles, in January of 1958, named American Ambassador to Libya. But by then I
                    had been in the Department for four years, over four years, so I was due an
                    assignment. There had been a political appointee in Libya and President
                    Eisenhower was persuaded that a career Officer would be a good idea, so I was
                    named Ambassador to Libya, my first Ambassadorial post.</p>
                <p>I left the Department in February of 1958, I believe, and traveled to Libya,
                    arriving there — we went by plane most of the way, yes, that's true, we did go
                    by plane — arriving in Tripoli in March of 1958.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONES: Yes. And I wish I could recall. ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not for some years later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: I was in Naples en route for quite a long while. The reason I didn't get
                    there until March, I was in Naples for quite a long while waiting the word to
                    move on to Tripoli. I remember now that the delay was because of the unfortunate
                    illness of my predecessor who was confined to hospital in Wheelus Air Force
                    Base. It was quite inappropriate, diplomatically, for an Ambassador to arrive in
                    a country before the departure of his predecessor. So that's why I continued to
                    be held up in Naples, which was delightful for me. My wife and daughters were
                    there with me, (my son was in boarding school in Washington), and we lived in
                    some style in the hotel in Naples, saw a lot of old friends and had a very
                    delightful time there. But finally the Department decided that they couldn't
                    hold me up any longer, that Ramadan was approaching and that I should get to
                    Libya to present my credentials before the holy season of Ramadan had begun,
                    during which period the King would not receive any Ambassadors.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>So I was flown to Wheelus Air Force Base and moved into the Embassy residence in
                    Tripoli. While there I did go and call on my predecessor Ambassador John L.
                    Tappin, still in the hospital. Saw him and he was most apologetic about the
                    delay his health had caused. Then I was told to proceed to Benghazi where we
                    stayed with the Consul General and his wife, and then on up to Tobruk, where the
                    King was in residence. I presented my credentials to His Majesty, King Idriss I
                    in March of 1958. Because of the strict Moslem custom of women remaining in
                    purdah, I had lunch separately with the King and my wife had lunch with the
                    Queen. After lunch and after we had presented our credentials, we drove back
                    down the mountain to Benghazi. I think we didn't even spend the night in Tobruk,
                    I think we drove up and came back to Benghazi the same day. I was then fully
                    accredited as the American Ambassador. We then went back to Tripoli, because the
                    Libyan government in those days was stationed, at the time I arrived, in
                    Tripoli, the capital of Tripolitania. Within a very short few months, by July of
                    '58, it was time for the government to move to its Cyrenaica capital in
                    Benghazi. So within three months, four months of my arrival in Libya, I
                    transferred the major portion of the American Embassy from Tripoli to Benghazi
                    and established the Embassy residence in Benghazi. Tripoli became the place
                    where the Charg� d'Affaires lived, Paul Barringer. That's not quite true. Rodger
                    Davies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there before Paul?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Yes. Rodger Davies was the Charg� d'Affaires, (number two in the Embassy)
                    in Tripoli, when I arrived and then stayed on in Libya with me as the Deputy
                    Chief of Mission until Paul Barringer arrived. Rodger was then transferred and,
                    as we know, later became Ambassador. He is one of the martyrs of our service;
                    was assassinated later in his career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At this time our principal problem there was Wheelus Air

                </p>
                <p>JONES: Really very little except for Wheelus Air Force Base and the large number
                    of Americans who were stationed in and around Tripoli.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had the American oil companies started by that time? Or
                        was that later?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: After I got there in 1958 American oil companies heard that there was a
                    possibility of oil in Libya and came over and began their drilling. There were a
                    great many dry holes struck at the beginning in '59. It was sometime in 1960
                    when I was at a diplomatic reception, I believe in Benghazi, I think the
                    government was still in Cyrenaica, that someone came up to me and said, “Mr.
                    Ambassador, did you know that Esso Standard has struck a gusher in its oil field
                    near the coast?” And I said, “What is a gusher?” He said, “17,000 barrels a
                    day.” And I said, “How much is a good oil well in Texas?” He said, “About 600.”
                    So I knew that Libya was no longer on the U.S./U.K. dole. Because at that time
                    the only external source of income for the Libyan government, except for its
                    principal export of peanuts, was what the British paid for their base rights in
                    Tobruk and what the American government paid for its base rights at Wheelus Air
                    Force Base.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was no significant tourist income, really, I
                        suppose.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: No, there was not. I suddenly realized that Libya was going to be
                    economically independent with this incredible news. And then of course between
                    1960 and the end of my tour there in 1962, other companies began striking
                    incredible amounts of oil and Libya suddenly became the new great oil exporter
                    of the world. This didn't happen overnight, but, by the time I left I think
                    Libya was already getting something like $200,000 a year from its oil.
                    Considering that we had paid them $10,000 a year for Wheelus and the British had
                    paid them $8,000 a year for their bases.</p>

                    perhaps it is in the millions. By the time I left at the end of '52, all this
                    oil wealth seemed suddenly incredible for a country that had had no external
                    source of income at all, except what the great foreign powers were willing to
                    pay for base rights.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your method of dealing there? Did everything have
                        to be done with the King and his immediate advisors? Or was there an
                        organized foreign office in the normal European sense that we're accustomed
                        to that you dealt with while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: No. The new system, well, the old system — the kingdom was only a few
                    years old, established in 1952, and because Cyrenaica and Tripolitania, as you
                    undoubtedly know, were two separate entities, they refused to agree to one
                    capital. So therefore it was agreed that the government would spend two years in
                    the capital of Tripolitania and two years in the capital of Cyrenaica. And
                    during the summer when the King was in residence in Tobruk that they would move
                    to Beyda for the summer months. It was during this period that I was the first
                    foreign Ambassador to decide to move with the government. When I told my
                    colleagues in the diplomatic corps that I was going to move my residence and the
                    Embassy staff to Benghazi when the government moved to Cyrenaica in 1958, most
                    of them were very unhappy indeed. And most of them refused to move. But I think
                    later it became customary for most of the embassies to move back and forth. The
                    British did the same thing that I did, established an Embassy in Benghazi for
                    the next two years, that would be from 1958 to 1960. And then I think we moved
                    back to Tripoli again for two years and then when the King established the new
                    capital permanently at Beyda I moved my residence up to Cyrene (nearby) and
                    spent the last year with the government at Beyda.</p>
                <p>My last years there were spent renegotiating the base agreement. But in answer to
                    your question, I did do practically all of my business with the Prime Minister
                    and with the Foreign Minister who were representing the kingdom of Libya or the
                    government of Libya in those days.</p>

                        a tribal chief who dictated? Did he pick all the ministers or were they
                        accountable to a parliament or how does it work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: He picked the ministers, that's true. But the King was a constitutional
                    monarch and interfered very little, perhaps not enough, in the conduct of
                    government, so that when he appointed a prime minister and the prime minister
                    then appointed his foreign minister and the other ministers, he ran the
                    government on behalf of the King. And the visits to Tobruk where the King
                    preferred to live, or to Beyda where he eventually established himself, were
                    more ceremonial than businesslike.</p>

                        by the Italians? Or had they developed a native training system of their
                        own?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>JONES: Tribal politics I'm sure played a great deal in this and I was not
                    terribly cognizant of it. But most of the ministers that I dealt with, in fact
                    all of them, had been raised in Italian schools, had been raised during this
                    Italian period of colonization. So I was able, with very little restudying, to
                    get back to use my Italian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was quite difficult.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Yes, after four years in Spain. But I did find an Italian professor there
                    who helped me a great deal, and I soon came back and practically all of my
                    negotiations, except the specific and serious base negotiations when we were
                    dealing with articles and paragraphs, were done in Italian. And I think that the
                    ministers were rather pleased to have an excuse to speak Italian, a language
                    which they all spoke fluently and which they obviously couldn't speak to each
                    other, to have an Ambassador, besides the Italian Ambassador, that they could
                    speak Italian to. So really for that five years in Libya, back and forth, I
                    conducted most of my official business in Italian.</p>
                <p>When I went to see the King I had to take an interpreter with me because the King
                    obviously spoke no Italian, spoke only Arabic. I had a wonderful Palestinian
                    named Mohammed Salah who went with me and spoke beautiful Arabic and also, being
                    a Palestinian, was raised in English schools and spoke beautiful English.</p>

                <p>JONES: I think I'd just like to finish up by saying that I did have the great
                    success, I consider one of my principal diplomatic successes, of renegotiating
                    the base agreement with the government of Libya before I left, because it was
                    about to run out in 1963, I've forgotten the exact date. And I was able to
                    renegotiate with a higher payment, of course, but I was able to renegotiate the
                    base agreement with Libya for Wheelus Air Force Base before I left.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONES: That's right. The base agreement had been. And I learned a lot from that
                    series of negotiation, patience, patience, patience. Negotiation over a period
                    of a year or more.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONES: When I look back on it, I must say quickly that Libya was one of the most
                    successful and delightful and pleasant posts of my entire service. And it's
                    interesting because now, given the reaction of most people to Libya, it's hard
                    to believe that Libya in the late '50s and early '60s was one of the most
                    delightful posts. And of course with the Greco/Roman ruins along the northern
                    Mediterranean shore. ...</p>

                    as much as I did because she was constantly involved in some new archeological
                    find or dig, which she would hear about and sometimes go and visit.</p>

                        people you have on your staff. I wonder if there are any transition remarks
                        you want to make about leaving Libya and your assignment to your next post,
                        or anything else you want to add about Libya, as far as that's concerned. If
                        you would go ahead on that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>JONES: Yes. One interesting incident or event in my Libyan tour was the visit of
                    the Crown Prince of Libya to Washington in the fall of 1962. It was not an
                    official visit, or a state visit, because it was not the King that was coming
                    but it was his heir, his nephew, the Crown Prince of Libya, and it was called a
                    “Presidential” visit. I arrived on an Air Force plane from Libya with the Crown
                    Prince in October of 1962. The Prince was in Washington for a three-day visit
                    and then was taken by the Chief of Protocol on a tour of the United States
                    before he returned to Libya.</p>
                <p>The Crown Prince was received at the airport by the Secretary of State, Dean
                    Rusk. On the way back the Prince went off with the Libyan Ambassador and I rode
                    back from the airport to my quarters in Washington with the Secretary. He told
                    me, on the way back, that I might find that the President, who was John F.
                    Kennedy, a bit preoccupied because we had just had some disturbing news about
                    Russian activities in Cuba. I thought not much more about that, of course, and
                    in the afternoon I believe the President had a meeting with the Crown Prince. In
                    any event, the next day the Crown Prince was due at the White House for a
                    luncheon and as we were there waiting to be ushered in, the President called and
                    said that he wanted to speak to the Ambassador. We said, “Which Ambassador?
                    Libyan or American?” He said, “The American Ambassador.” So I went in and the
                    President seemed to be rather flustered and pressed for time, but I didn't think
                    anything about it particularly, it was part of his general busy schedule.</p>
                <p>He said, “Tell me about this young man. I saw him at the Libyan Embassy last
                    night and I found it rather difficult to communicate with him. I just don't
                    understand him.” I explained to the President that the Crown Prince had been
                    raised in strictly Moslem society, that he had not gone to formal school but had
                    been raised by a study of the Koran, that his marriage had been arranged by his
                    family and that the Prince had never before been outside of Libya. This was part
                    of his education and I felt that it was important for him, if he were going to
                    be the next King of Libya, that it was important for him to have as his first
                    foreign visit and first foreign contact the United States and a visit to the
                    President and to our capital and to our country. That he was really a very
                    provincial young man with no foreign experience, really very little national
                    experience even in his own country.</p>
                <p>I of course learned later that the President was under enormous pressure during
                    the whole time of the Crown Prince's visit because he had learned about the
                    missiles in Cuba and was considering what position to take with Khrushchev on
                    the Cuban missile crisis. My admiration for the President has always been
                    enormous: during this very critical period in his political life and in the
                    history of our country, that he was able to appear to the general public,
                    whenever he was with the Crown Prince either in the White House or at the Libyan
                    Embassy, that the Crown Prince's visit was the most important thing that he had
                    to deal with that day.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>It was only after the Crown Prince had left Washington and was taking his North
                    American or United States tour that the President made his famous speech about
                    the Soviet missiles in Cuba and the position that he had taken with
                    Khrushchev.</p>
                <p>Next subject: While I was on my visit in the United States waiting for the Crown
                    Prince to complete his American visit, I was told by the Director General of the
                    Foreign Service. ...</p>
                <p>I was going to soon receive official notice that the President wished to appoint
                    me his Ambassador to Peru. This came as a complete surprise, but of course I was
                    delighted. I had been in Libya for five years and it was high time for a
                    transfer.</p>
                <p>The interesting and amusing part of the Peruvian appointment, ironic in a sense,
                    the President's Ambassador or the American Ambassador in Peru, appointed shortly
                    after President Kennedy became President in 1961 was a man named James Loeb, a
                    political appointee, publisher of a newspaper in New England. He had been there
                    at the time of the Presidential elections when Haya de la Torre, the Aprista
                    candidate for President, was elected. I learned later that there were rumors
                    that Mr. Loeb had been very pro-Aprista and some of the Aprista opponents and
                    opposition had indicated or even accused publicly the American Ambassador of
                    being pro-Aprista and having helped Haya de la Torre win the election. After
                    Haya de la Torre won the elections but before he had assumed the presidency,
                    there was a military coup and the military coup was based on decades of
                    animosity between the military and the Aprista Party. No Aprista President, even
                    though Haya de la Torre and others had won the elections, had ever been able to
                    take over the presidency because of the military animosity. So this was a
                    military coup against Haya de la Torre and the Aprista Party to prevent him from
                    ever assuming the Presidency.</p>
                <p>This was the year after the President, President Kennedy, had taken a lead in
                    establishing what was known as the Alliance for Progress and had been in Punta
                    del Este at the time of the forming of this alliance and established certain
                    principles, including which were democratic government in all of the countries
                    that were part of the Alliance for Progress in Central and South America. The
                    military coup in Peru was the first obvious move against the principals of the
                    Alliance for Progress by a military coup against a democratically elected,
                    established government. President Kennedy was so shaken by this, so
                    disappointed, so discouraged and so outraged that he recalled his Ambassador,
                    James Loeb, as an indication of American displeasure.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>The months went by, the Charg� d'Affaires was Douglas Henderson. The military
                    seemed to be firmly in control in Peru. Eight or nine months later after the
                    coup d'etat it was reported that Ralph Duggan, the President's assistant in the
                    White House, said to him, “Mr. President, you know, those military are firmly in
                    control and they are not going to go away and we do not have an Ambassador in
                    Peru. I think you ought to think about appointing an Ambassador to the military
                    government, just accept it as a fact of life.” The story is, which perhaps is
                    apocryphal, but rather amusing-the report that I heard was, that they were
                    looking around for an Ambassador that didn't have any previous connections with
                    Peru and couldn't possibly be accused of having any political preferences for
                    one party or another. Here I was, having been five years in Libya and about
                    ready to leave, and never having served in a Latin American post in my life,
                    except for the little post in Mexico at the very beginning of my service where I
                    was stationed for nine months only.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you did at least speak Spanish.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Yes, my record showed that I had been four years in Spain and therefore I
                    had language qualifications. So the story was that they appointed Johnny Jones
                    Ambassador because he didn't “know nothing” about Peru.</p>
                <p>I learned while in Washington that this appointment was going to take place and
                    by the time I got back to Libya and was able to tell my wife, in confidence,
                    that we were going to Peru, the orders had already been written and were on
                    their way. This interesting coincidence of the Cuban missile crisis and the
                    visit of the Crown Prince of Libya to Washington also brought with it news of my
                    next assignment and appointment to Peru.</p>
                <p>So we came home for Christmas in 1962, on home leave and transfer. I left Libya
                    in mid-December, had Christmas in Annapolis with my wife's family and then was
                    sworn in in early January, as Ambassador to Peru and got down to Peru I believe
                    in January of 1963.</p>

                        found there and how you coped with them?</hi>

                <p>JONES: I presented my credentials to an Ambassador and interestingly enough.

                <p>JONES: I'm sorry, forgive me. To a General. I will have his name in a moment.
                    Perez Godoy, General Perez Godoy. The Chief of Protocol in those days was a
                    young Peruvian named Javier Perez de Cuellar, who, as we all know, is now the
                    Secretary General of the United Nations. But Javier and his wife became very
                    good friends of Kitty and me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I just wanted to get that for the transcribers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: We were met at the airport and conducted into town by Javier. Douglas
                    Henderson was the Charg� d'Affaires. (He later was our Ambassador to Bolivia.) I
                    presented my credentials to General Perez Godoy at the Presidential Palace
                    within a few days thereafter.</p>
                <p>My instructions in a vague sense were that, while we would maintain formal and
                    polite relations with the military government, I should do everything possible
                    to encourage a return to democratic government; to the re-establishment of
                    constitutional government. And it was within that first year, after I arrived,
                    that the military decided that they would hold Presidential elections for a new
                    President who would succeed the military government. Perez Godoy was not one of
                    my favorites, but there were some good military in that government from
                    well-established Peruvian families who did want a return to constitutional
                    government. This was arranged and we were all delighted with it. Of course the
                    American Embassy in particular encouraged all Peruvians and all officials in the
                    military government in this direction.</p>
                <p>As we know, Fernando Belaunde Terry was elected President of Peru and I think the
                    date, I would have to check this, but I think the elections were the same year
                    that I arrived, 1963. But it may have been a year later, it may have been in
                    1964. This is perfectly easy to establish once I get hold of my papers. (July
                    28, 1963 is the date Belaunde was sworn in as President).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That any researcher can find out by looking. ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>That is a rather delicate proposal to encourage a people in how they form their
                    government, what kind of government they have. Did you have any particular
                    techniques that were successful?</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>JONES: I don't think really. I think it was generally known that the President of
                    the United States had been a key figure in establishing the Alliance for
                    Progress, that the Alliance for Progress was a key element in the economic
                    development of the Latin American countries, so that all Latinos who thought in
                    economic terms realized how important it was to stay within the bounds of the
                    Alliance for Progress, which also included continuation or maintenance of
                    democratic government. So this would be one of the points that we could always
                    talk about. Economic aid, I remember, was suspended for a period but when I went
                    as Ambassador, accredited to the military government, economic aid continued to
                    flow in the same way. It was just generally understood that this was what the
                    President wanted and that as his Ambassador I would talk about it and encourage
                    it at all points.</p>
                <p>The Aprista Party was defeated and Belaunde's party was called Accion Popular. It
                    was considered left of center but it was not considered as far left of center as
                    the Apristas, so therefore there was no real threat or fear of another military
                    coup before Belaunde could be inaugurated. We went to the inaugural ceremonies,
                    of course, and there were several U.S. Senators and Congressmen, whose names I
                    shall perhaps think of during the course of the conversation, who came down to
                    represent the President, as a Presidential delegation, at the inauguration of
                    the democratically elected President of Peru. [The delegation was headed by
                    Senator Morse and included Edwin M. Martin, Assistant Secretary of State and
                    Ralph Dungan, White House aide.]</p>
                <p>The President and his first wife had been separated. So he was a bachelor when he
                    took office. In any event, we had very cordial relations with the new President
                    and I came to be very fond of him and got to know him very well. We worked
                    together within the Alliance for Progress with the AID program. He had various
                    grandiose schemes for the development of Peru, one of which was called the
                    Carretera Marginal which was a great scheme to build roads down across the
                    mountains onto the other side of the Andes into what was territorially a much
                    greater expanse of Peru than the very narrow strip along the coast where most of
                    the population and civilization existed.</p>
                <p>This was to open up the interior of Peru and bring the products of the peasants
                    on the other side of the Andes down to the coast and make also politically a
                    connection between that very separated part of Peru (very little explored and
                    known part of Peru, which was a jungle really), and the coastal area. Anyway,
                    this did not receive very much enthusiastic support in Washington. They
                    considered it a terribly expensive and inappropriate kind of an aid program.
                    They were much more interested in developing what was already available. So one
                    of the problems with Belaunde and the administration in Washington was getting
                    aid for the kind of programs that he wanted and aid for the sort of programs
                    that we thought would be most appropriate for Peruvian development.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>I think eventually the President did get some assistance for his road-building
                    scheme because it was realized that perhaps opening up the eastern part of Peru
                    across that great divide of the Andes was in his country's long-term
                    interest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was your AID program administered? Did you have a
                        large staff in Peru? Or was most of the work done by visiting specialists
                        and instructors?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: No, we had a large staff, AID. Robert Culbertson was the AID Director. He
                    was very good and we worked together in great harmony. The AID programs were
                    always discussed at the country team meetings. Everybody's views were obtained
                    on what would be the best thing to recommend to Washington. Then of course the
                    AID program and the administration in Washington had their own definite ideas
                    about what they thought Peru needed, so that there was always considerable
                    negotiation between the field and Washington about recommendations on what our
                    AID program should be.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's much easier to coordinate around the table in the

                <p>JONES: It is indeed. It is indeed.</p>
                <p>It was an interesting period while Belaunde was there and we had very good
                    relations. I'm trying to think of what other things came up during that
                    period.</p>

                        suppose?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: No, not really. Where I first learned of and was introduced to the coca
                    plant was in Peru because it grew wild in the mountains of Peru. Its leaves were
                    something that were brewed and either drunk in tea or chewed like tobacco by all
                    of the peasants in the high Andes because it gave a certain amount of strength
                    and endurance-let's say like coffee does or tea, to the peasants and of course
                    most of them walked. In those high altitudes they had enormous chests; they were
                    rather short people, their legs were not very long and they were used to
                    carrying heavy burdens. But they needed something to sort of give them that
                    extra heave. Now in leaf form it's not a drug anymore than coffee or tea is
                    because it was not ground down to the fine powder that cocaine is, but it did
                    have this medicinal effect of giving one a little more energy and a little more
                    strength. When they were carrying their packs over the mountain trails, from the
                    days of the Incas, coca was the sort of thing that they chewed. Then of course
                    later, it was not during the time I was there, but later, it became very popular
                    crop because they could sell it to drug dealers and get enormous fees for
                    it.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>My wife and I did a lot of visiting during the time we were in Peru. I felt that
                    it was important for an Ambassador to get around and know the country so we
                    visited all the great cities and were usually welcomed there by the mayor and
                    the town council. My Spanish over the years improved so that I was able to make
                    speeches in Spanish. Arequipa, was the hometown of the President, Fernando
                    Belaunde Terry. His last name implies an English ancestor. There was an
                    important Anglo community in Peru, descended from early English immigrants who
                    had stayed on and became completely Peruvian, but they kept their English names.
                    One of my dear old friends was Carlos Gibson, “Charley” Gibson, who married an
                    American, Flo, and is now living in this country. But Gibson was a perfectly
                    acceptable Peruvian name. Another was the Archbishop Land�zuri Ricketts. His
                    mother was a Miss Ricketts, obviously of English extraction. And the President
                    was Belaunde Terry, and his mother was a Miss Terry, obviously of Anglo
                    extraction. So there was an important British influence in the upper classes, in
                    the ruling classes, of many Peruvian families.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have to relearn Spanish in a sense? In other
                        words, not to refresh it, but is Peruvian Spanish quite different from
                        Castilian Spanish? Or is it fairly close?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Peruvian Spanish and Columbian Spanish I believe are considered, by
                    Spaniards, the best Spanish in Latin America, which means that they have been
                    less changed. But of course they do not use the “theta”. But I made no effort to
                    change my Castilian Spanish when I was in Peru, I continued speaking with the
                    theta. I think in a way it was rather a plus for me because it sort of impressed
                    people. It would be like a foreigner speaking English in America with an Oxford
                    accent. So I think it didn't do me any harm. Almost every time I went to a new
                    place and started speaking, some Peruvian would say to me, and where did you
                    learn your Spanish? I would say, in Spain, and they would understand perfectly
                    well that I was not affecting this accent but that this was the way I had
                    learned my Spanish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did Belaunde last?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: I'm trying to think when the coup d'etat was. Unfortunately, I tell my
                    friends, and I'll tell you, that I stayed in Peru too long. If I had left in
                    early 1968 when there were some suggestions that I might be transferred back to
                    the Department of State (which I resisted) if I had left in 1968 I would have
                    gone out in a blaze of glory, because our relations with Peru were excellent at
                    that time. But, unfortunately, I stayed on and on October 3, 1968 I was wakened
                    by a telephone call either from my Minister Counselor or from the head of the
                    Political Section, Frank Ortiz, saying, “Mr. Ambassador, there are tanks in the
                    courtyard of the Presidential Palace and they're pointing out, which means that
                    there's been a military coup and that the military are already inside and in
                    possession of the Palace.”</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>This was a blow and really unexpected. However, I have failed to mention — and
                    this was one of the reasons for the coup, I'm afraid — that in my negotiations
                    with Belaunde, we had worked out a very sticky, long-standing problem involving
                    an American oil installation in northern Peru which had belonged to Esso
                    Standard. What we worked out was that this was property which in early Peruvian
                    days the American oil company — not early Peruvian days, but the early part of
                    this century or perhaps even the last century, the American oil company Esso
                    Standard had bought this property (called La Brea y Pari�as) and considered that
                    they owned it. The Peruvians agreed that their title showed that they owned it,
                    but their dispute was that they didn't own what was under the ground. And
                    because this was an oil well, the Peruvians were constantly threatening to
                    expropriate it. One of my principal tasks in the latter years of my tour there
                    was to work out an agreement with the government of Belaunde favorable to Esso
                    Standard and favorable to American interests and one that the Peruvians could
                    accept. We agreed that Esso Standard could have a lease on the oilfield at La
                    Brea y Pari�as for X number of years, I've forgotten now how many, 10, 15, 20
                    years, in exchange for which the title to the property would be returned to the
                    government of Peru. So this settled the dispute over the title, but it also
                    protected the interest of the oil company. [Telephone]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were working out the agreement on the Esso Standard
                        oil claim.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Yes. In any event, this agreement when it was announced — and I of course
                    was pleased with it — seemed to be a great achievement, but we were immediately
                    attacked by a local newspaper, El Comercio, which was a very nationalistic
                    newspaper and usually supported military coups whenever the government was
                    considered a little too far to the left. It was also violently anti-Aprista, El
                    Comercio always had been. So it immediately began attacking this agreement and
                    pointing out that Belaunde had really sold Peru down the river and had given
                    away Peruvian oil rights, etc., etc., etc.</p>
                <p>So in a sense the coup d'etat by the military was not only against a left of
                    center government but also against the deal that they had struck with the United
                    States over this oilfield. So the coup d'etat meant the end of this agreement. I
                    was perfectly aware of that. The general who carried out the coup was General
                    Velasco. He was not a friend of the United States and curiously enough, was
                    rather a Socialist in his outlook when he became President.</p>
                <p>Among other things, he started nationalizing private companies. Of course the
                    first thing he did was nationalize American companies and then all foreign
                    companies. So that my last year in Peru was a very sad one, diplomatically and
                    professionally, because I spent most of my time carrying notes of protest to the
                    Foreign Minister, who was an admiral in the Peruvian Navy, whose name I shall
                    think of — Admiral Llosa. He was, on my terms, a good guy. But after all, he was
                    part of the military government and he had to carry out the government's
                    policies.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>The nationalization process continued. Then there were elections in the United
                    States and Richard Nixon was elected President of the U.S. I was called home on
                    consultation. The principal problem that we talked about was the military
                    government and the expropriation of American properties. Also, not only was it
                    just the oilfield at La Brea y Pari�as, but when they expropriated all foreign
                    companies, they took over an American lead and copper mine near Lima, up in the
                    mountains, and they also took over an American copper mine in the south, south
                    of Arequipa. Toward the end of my tour there, my principal activities were a
                    series of protests about another American commercial property that had been
                    expropriated and taken over by the military government. When I came home on
                    consultation it was decided that, since I had been in Peru so long and had been
                    so closely associated with former President Belaunde, it would probably be wise
                    to send a special envoy, representing the new President of the United States to
                    Peru to negotiate with the new military government over the expropriation of
                    American property and a just compensation that we should be getting for it,
                    because it had been expropriated without any compensation.</p>
                <p>A very distinguished American named Jack Irwin — does that name mean anything to
                    you?</p>

                <p>JONES: Yes, that's right. Jack Irwin was appointed. IBM, thank you. Jack Irwin
                    was appointed Presidential envoy to come down and negotiate with the Peruvian
                    government. I was informed that my days in Peru were not exactly numbered, but
                    that they wouldn't last very much longer. I had been there six years. So I
                    learned from my good friend, Toby Belcher, who was then Director of West Coast
                    Affairs in the Interamerican. ...</p>

                <p>JONES: ARA, yes. American Republics. That they'd look around for another post for
                    me. I was nominated (I leaned later) to be Ambassador to Mexico. But
                    unfortunately there was someone in the White House on Mr. Nixon's staff who
                    decided that there were political favors to be paid. So when my nomination came
                    from the State Department it was not acted on and a political appointee got the
                    job as Ambassador to Mexico.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>In any event, I came home in 1969, in late spring of 1969. When I got home, I was
                    disappointed to learn that there were no diplomatic missions available to me but
                    that I was going to be appointed, unless I strenuously objected [break in tape]
                    — as Deputy Commandant for International Affairs at the National War College in
                    Washington. I thought about this and while I was disappointed not to have
                    another mission, as I said earlier, I decided that this would be an interesting
                    end to my service, having two years in an academic institution. Since during my
                    long career I had never been selected to go to any of the war colleges, which
                    many of my colleagues had, this was an opportunity to be part of one. So my wife
                    and I moved into Quarters 15 at Fort McNair when the National War College was an
                    entity unto itself, before the Defense University complex had been established.
                    We had our last two years of active service, living in the United States at Fort
                    McNair and being part of a very interesting faculty and part of a very
                    interesting educational institution which included, of course, not only the
                    three military services but also representatives of the State Department, the
                    United States Information Agency and the CIA.</p>

                </p>
                <p>What were your general duties as Deputy Commandant? Were they largely ceremonial
                    or did you have some substantive duties or administrative duties or consultative
                    duties? What kinds of jobs did you have there?</p>
                <p>JONES: I remember with each class, as it came in, that each one of the
                    Commandants would get up and address the student body, telling them more or less
                    what their position and duties were. And also to talk a little bit about the
                    field in which they worked. So when I would present myself to the student body I
                    would also discuss current foreign policy issues that the government of the
                    United States was facing at that particular time concerning which we would be
                    getting lectures later on. Then when there were civilian lecturers on political
                    topics, during the course of the academic year, I would be the one who would be
                    expected to introduce them to the student body.</p>
                <p>It turned out to be a very interesting and very productive part of my personal as
                    well as official life, living in an academic atmosphere and meeting a lot of
                    very interesting people including ranking State Department officials who would
                    come out to talk to us and also those from other parts of the government.</p>
                <p>Looking back on it, I must say I enjoyed that two years at the War College very
                    much.</p>

                        I mean, consultation on current problems or anything of that sort? Or, as I
                        suspect, were you generally ignored in this respect?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: No, I don't think I was consulted at all. It was considered that I had a
                    specific task to at the War College. I don't remember that I was consulted on
                    anything.</p>

                        career and I'm very glad I got this opportunity to get particularly the
                        Peruvian part, which is absolutely fascinating. I wonder if you would mind
                        perhaps reflecting a little bit on a few of the special problems of the
                        Foreign Service and of the representatives of the executive branch abroad.
                        Perhaps first I would be interested in your philosophical and practical
                        views on the subject of political versus career Ambassadors because I think
                        this tape has indicated that you've had about as much experience as anyone
                        in the service in dealing with both kinds of officers. We both know that
                        they both have their place, but I'd be interested in any views and any
                        illustrative experiences that you might have on the subject of when
                        political Ambassadors are good and when they're bad. And perhaps the same
                        thing might be said about career Ambassadors because we all know that career
                        does not endow its members with perfection in all respects. But is this a
                        subject that — I'm sure that you've thought about it a great deal and I'd

                <p>JONES: Obviously I'm prejudiced. I'm prejudiced in favor of career Ambassadors
                    and the career Foreign Service. And I don't need to go into all the reasons why,
                    because you understand that. Most career Officers do. My own experience was
                    pretty much with career Officers going all the way back to William Phillips, who
                    was my Ambassador in Rome and Jimmy Dunn who was later my Ambassador in
                    Rome.</p>

                    I must say, were very interesting. Particularly in Madrid when I was number two
                    in the Embassy, it was important for me not only to have a good working
                    relationship with them, but also to try and influence them as much as I could in
                    the way of policy and also in the messages that they sent to the State
                    Department, interpreting the country in which they were involved. Stanton
                    Griffis was my Ambassador in Spain, very interesting man. He had had some other
                    ambassadorial assignments, but had come from the movie industry, MGM. So my
                    effort there was to try to edit his telegrams and dispatches to the State
                    Department to bring them down to what I always considered more appropriate and
                    less colorful language.</p>

                    on a visit of some kind, so I already knew them. But he, I think, did quite a

                    time about sending a woman to a country like Italy which was so male-dominated
                    and oriented that I couldn't imagine them accepting a female Ambassador from a
                    great power in good grace. But it turned out that she did do a good job and that
                    she was accepted by the Italians and, eventually they not only accepted her but

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you feel, as I have always felt, that there were times
                        when a political Ambassador was very useful, if he or she was good. That it
                        was good to have somebody who had political clout at home, that it was good
                        to have such people who had knowledge of the Foreign Service and its ability
                        and could perhaps give us a constituent support, so to speak, after they had
                        served as Ambassadors who came back. It could also cause grave problems of
                        lack of that kind of experience and so forth. At the same time, there are
                        times when a career Ambassador simply doesn't have the clout or the
                        characteristics perhaps, he may have been an excellent reporting officer and
                        may not be a great Ambassador. So there are two sides to the coin. Do you

                    play a much more effective role as an American Ambassador [phone] but I think
                    it's on the whole many of the political Ambassadors are appointed because they
                    have made substantial contributions to a Presidential campaign or because they
                    are close friends of important Senators or people in the administration who the
                    President thinks are important to him. So very often, many of these people go
                    abroad and the President doesn't even know them. And I'm not sure that they do
                    indeed have the kind of. ...</p>

                    think of some, oh, Lincoln MacVeagh was my Ambassador in Spain after Stanton
                    Griffis. He was a political appointee but very close to the Democratic
                    administration, having been appointed by Franklin Roosevelt, I believe. He had
                    been Ambassador in Portugal and before that had been Ambassador in Greece. So he
                    came with considerable background and in a sense, if I remember now, he had been
                    an American Ambassador for 19 years when President Eisenhower was elected and
                    ended a long, long period of a Democratic administration. As all Ambassadors had
                    to do, Mr. MacVeagh submitted his resignation and to his great chagrin, and to
                    my surprise, it was one of the very first resignations that President Eisenhower
                    accepted. I think the Ambassador was very upset and discouraged, because if he
                    had stayed in another year he would have completed 20 years and that might have
                    given him right to a government pension. I'm not sure about that. But in any
                    event, he was disappointed and left with some bitterness. But in a sense, it was
                    a Godsend because then Jimmy Dunn was appointed Ambassador, career Ambassador,
                    to succeed him and he came at a very important time when we were just completing
                    the negotiations for our bases in Spain.</p>
                <p>So I must say that in most of my experience, the career Ambassador have been the
                    most effective.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A second question that I think a Foreign Service Officer
                        has a chance to observe and is of considerable importance is the process of
                        policy formulation and tactical policy formulation that goes on in the
                        United States government which I think is perhaps best reflected for the
                        Ambassador by the accuracy and promptness of the instructions that he
                        receives from the Department. Do you have any particular comments on this
                        thing, being mindful that you were both in the chain of preparing those
                        instructions on many occasions and for a much longer in the position of user
                        of those instructions? Do you have any thoughts about how adequate they
                        were? Did you generally find you could have a clear idea of what you were
                        supposed to be doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: If you were on the receiving end?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If you were in the field, what the man in the field, what
                        picture he had of his mission, what he should do in general and what he
                        should do in specific crisis situations, let's say.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: I think generally the instructions were clear and good. Because they were
                    probably originally drafted by the Desk Officer of a particular country it meant
                    that they were drafted by someone who had a fairly good, correct view of the
                    country in which I as serving.</p>
                <p>There was only one time when I was at odds with the Department and that was over
                    the application of economic sanctions against the military government in Peru at
                    the time of the coup in 1968. We had some legislation called the Hickenlooper
                    amendment. The Hickenlooper amendment required that, if there was an
                    expropriation of American property, immediately the sanctions would be applied,
                    that any aid to the country would be immediately cut off. Since we had
                    threatened President Belaunde with the Hickenlooper amendment unless he reached
                    an agreement with us on the threatened oil expropriation and the oil well
                    problem, when the military government came along later and did expropriate that
                    American property in the north of Peru, my recommendations to the Department
                    were that we apply the Hickenlooper amendment and economic sanctions against the
                    new Peruvian government.</p>
                <p>There was a tendency in the Department and in the Interamerican Bureau and
                    actually the Peruvian desk, too, that we negotiate, that we talk to them, that
                    we not come down with the ax. Particularly because there was a new President in
                    the White House and nobody wanted to tell the new President, Mr. Nixon, that the
                    first thing he had to do as President was apply the Hickenlooper amendment to a
                    South American country which would practically mean breaking off relations with
                    it. So in these circumstances, the Department just didn't want to apply the
                    Hickenlooper amendment, although I kept recommending it. I was told later, (I
                    had sent some very top secret messages to the Secretary in this regard) that if
                    I hadn't been so secretive about it and that if I had just sent my
                    recommendations by less highly classified telegrams ,more people in the
                    Department might have read them (and in the White House) and that I might have
                    gotten more support for my position.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>But in any event, I was not supported in this recommendation for I guess
                    internal, political reasons. Didn't want a new administration to start off
                    penalizing a friendly South American country.</p>
                <p>But that was about the only time I think when there was a difference when I was
                    Chief of Mission, between myself and the Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We've talked about this a little before but I think
                        there's room for a little more exploration of it. There are really two
                        sections, one to do with the executive branch and the other dealing with
                        Congress. To take the executive branch first; the question of relations
                        between various entities of the executive branch which have a foreign
                        affairs interest, and we all know everybody thinks they have a foreign
                        affairs interest, throughout the government and those relationships as they
                        also exist in the field where you have representatives of these other
                        agencies which may report to both the State Department and their own agency.
                        I'd be interested in your comments on your relations perhaps first in your
                        Embassy itself with the AID missions, the information missions, with the
                        CIA, which is a difficult and thorny question, and perhaps with any other
                        agencies that might have been represented — the military missions,
                        certainly, are an important element. Do you have any thoughts on this or
                        experiences? Were they generally satisfactory? Were there instances of their
                        being unsatisfactory? What were the techniques you used to get
                        coordination?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: I think in general they were satisfactory. I found that the country team
                    meetings were very helpful method of bringing up questions of different points
                    of view and instructions from the various agencies who had different bosses back
                    in Washington, of discussing them and talking them out there and reach a
                    decision which generally would be accepted all around. If it was contrary or
                    slightly different than the instructions that the aid, the attach� had had from
                    his agency, he could go back and report that this was a decision that was
                    reached and this was what the Ambassador recommended, or I could report it to
                    the State Department. So on whole, I think generally as a result of the
                    briefings of the country team meetings, that we worked out most of our
                    problems.</p>
                <p>Now the one thing, of course, that we didn't discuss were covert actions. But I
                    always had a very good relationship with my CIA chief. My rule was that I was
                    kept informed of all principal plans and actions and projects that were going to
                    be developed and carried out in a covert manner. But the one thing that I never
                    asked for, and said I didn't want to know, were the names of the local
                    informants or the local people who were collaborating with the Central
                    Intelligence Agency in these activities. And by and large I think — perhaps we
                    didn't have anything very important — but by and large I think it worked very
                    well and I never had any scandal or complication or problem with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel either as an Ambassador or perhaps as a
                        Political Officer lower down the totem pole in the Embassy that there was a
                        competition between the intelligence collecting functions of the CIA and
                        those of the, shall we say, Political Section of the Embassy? Did this ever
                        become a problem that you know of? Did you feel that there was too much
                        emphasis on covert collection as opposed to the overt type of collecting and
                        reporting that the Political Section did?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: No, I don't think so. But I think, I hope, that I was informed and aware
                    of the various projects and what was going on; what we were trying to accomplish
                    and what we were trying to find out. Obviously during the length of time that we
                    were having problems with the military government over the expropriation of
                    property, any information that the CIA could develop over what the General was
                    going to do next, what his plans were, that sort of thing, would always be very
                    helpful. And I think that there was a fairly good, as I remember generally, good
                    collaboration between the Chief of Station and the head of the Political
                    Section. I think they kept each other informed. And of course the military
                    reporting was overt intelligence, which was quite appropriate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever have occasions of a conflict with your
                        military, or a struggle of wills with your military advisors or military
                        attach�s? Particularly In Latin America this sometimes might have been a
                        problem, I can imagine, with so much military to military contact between
                        America and the local country. Or did you feel that you were on top of this
                        and it never became a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Yes, you've just reminded me of something. The Peruvian government under
                    Belaunde wanted what was in those days, 1960s, a sophisticated airplane, F-4 is
                    what comes to mind, I've forgotten exactly what it was. It was considered too
                    sophisticated by the State Department, principally because we had as part of our
                    policy not to sell sophisticated military equipment to any Latin American
                    country. I urged the sale of these planes to Peru. The Government wanted them,
                    the military wanted it. And I urged it as a precautionary measure to protect
                    Belaunde because I felt that if the military — if the constitutional president
                    was unable to get for his military what they said they needed to carry on, not
                    only to carry on but to have a strong defense against territorial claims by
                    Ecuador, for example, that then they might throw him out in a military coup. But
                    the F-5s, I think it was an F-5, the F-5s were considered too sophisticated so
                    the State Department turned down my recommendations and the Peruvian request for
                    F-5s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this was an occasion, I presume, when you and your
                        military people were in agreement.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>JONES: In complete agreement, yes. But the interesting thing that happened was
                    that Belaunde then, and of course this was a great disappointment and nothing I
                    could do about it, he then turned to the Soviets who were absolutely delighted
                    to furnish him something equivalent. This happened, I think, after I left. No,
                    no, I shouldn't say that. It happened while I was still there. And with the
                    military, Soviet military equipment, of course, came Soviet military advisors
                    who detracted enormously from the advantageous position of our military advisors
                    who were already there, attached to the Peruvian military.</p>
                <p>Years later, I can remember that a successor of mine in Lima told me, back in
                    1983 when I visited Peru, just to consider all the Soviet military equipment and
                    advisors that were still there. And it all started with that F-5 episode. If
                    only we could have known how much better it would have been if we had kept the
                    military sales in our camp rather than saying no to the F-5s, which invited the
                    Soviets in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's very much the horns of a dilemma, I would say, that
                        you were on in this respect.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: That's hindsight.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course there's one other element that we've all had to
                        deal with a great deal, both at home and in the field, and that is the
                        interest of the Congress in foreign affairs and the practical effect it has
                        in the field of a good many Congressional visitors. And also special
                        Congressional interests and policies which may, or practices which may be in
                        conflict with the views of the State Department and/or the views of the
                        Embassy. I presume you've had a lot of experience with Congressional
                        visitors, to start with, during your time. Did you feel on the whole that
                        these were beneficial or caused more problems than they helped to
                        solve?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Congressional visits were always a very important part of our diplomatic
                    life and of the mission's experience. We knew how important the Congress was, we
                    knew how important the members' views were to what we were trying to achieve. So
                    I think we made every possible effort to help them, to try to brief them, but
                    also to try to make clear to them what was the accepted State Department and
                    administration policy at the time, in the hope that when they went home they
                    would support it.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>I found in dealing with them that they were really a very diverse group. You talk
                    about a Congressional visit as thought it was a unified whole, but in fact each
                    one had his own particular interests and so we were really dealing with
                    individual Congressmen and individual Senators, which took an awful lot of time
                    and a certain amount of tact to give them all what they wanted to know. I
                    suppose it's a useful experience. One wonders really how much Congressmen do get
                    out of a three-day visit to a country. They are exposed to Embassy briefings, to
                    the briefings of the authorities of the country that they're in. But it's a very
                    short time to really learn anything. And when they go back, does it really
                    affect their decisions and their policymaking? I'm not sure that they (the
                    visits) really are an effective tool.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At least the Congressman does have the opportunity,
                        whether he does it or not, of paying undivided attention to the problem of
                        foreign affairs for those two or three days whereas at home he'd be doing a
                        thousand other things, interrupted by constituents, votes on the floor,
                        debates, so on and so forth. At least there is a concentrated period there
                        that. ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: That's true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That we did have to present to them</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Yes, I think probably you're right. On balance it probably is better that
                    he's been exposed, even if only for three days, to a foreign culture and a
                    foreign atmosphere. And there are certain impressions, undoubtedly, that he will
                    carry away with him, that will affect his attitude and his vote down the line.
                    So it's probably well worth it.</p>

                <p>JONES: I'm devoted to the Foreign Service and it was certainly a good career for
                    me. As you know, I have a daughter now in the Foreign Service so I have a
                    continuing active interest in it. The thing that concerns me I think is the
                    present arrangement which is a result of the 1980 Foreign Service Act. There is
                    something called a 6-year window and when people get up to the present Class 1,
                    which used to be Class 3, or something like that, that then they have only a
                    limited time before they may be selected out if not promoted into the Senior
                    Service. I am distressed that this is the law because I am afraid that what
                    happens during this period is that some of the very most effective and
                    intelligent Officers will look ahead and think, well, if I wait six years, then
                    life may have passed me by, if I don't make it. But if I now look around I'm
                    young enough that I can find another occupation and another profession. So I'm
                    afraid we lose at that point a great many of our first-class Officers who decide
                    that they don't want to take the chance on waiting out the six-year window.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think maybe we are sacrificing in some extent
                        experience to brilliance in the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Yes, yes I do. I do think experience is terribly important.</p>
                <p>Well, Tully, thank you very much.</p>
                <p>

                <p>JONES: I'm delighted that the Association for Diplomatic Studies is beginning to
                    establish an archives for the library.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This will be an important part of it. Thank you,
                        Ambassador Jones.</hi>
