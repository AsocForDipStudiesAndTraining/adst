                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 29th of January, 1996. This is an interview
                        with Leonard H. Marks in his office in down-town Washington D.C. It's being
                        done on behalf of the Association of Diplomatic Studies and Training. I'm
                        Charles Stuart Kennedy. Mr. Marks, can we start out a bit about your early
                        upbringing. First I would like to ask you about your family.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARKS: All right. My dad was a politician in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. All of his
                    life he had either an appointive or elective position. I grew up interested in
                    government from the earliest times. I went to the University of Pittsburgh where
                    I was elected president of the student body. As a member of a fraternity I was
                    elected president of the fraternity. You can see from the outset I was
                    interested in running things as a politician.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was your father in any particular party?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARKS: No—he held positions under both parties. He was in law enforcement. As an
                    officer of the courts he held various positions during his lifetime. He
                    encouraged me to be a lawyer. I took his advice and I don't regret it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Pittsburgh... You were born when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARKS: When was I born? March 5, 1916.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you basically grew up between the two wars in
                        Pittsburgh. What was Pittsburgh and school like when you were a kid?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>MARKS: Well, Pittsburgh was a melting pot, truly the amalgam of nationalities in
                    the United States. I grew up with Poles, Italians, Hungarians, and Czechs, and
                    there was no distinction between black and white. We all lived together in the
                    same neighborhood; we went to the same school; we participated in the same
                    sports; we were social as well as neighborly friends. Pittsburgh was the home of
                    the steel industry, heavy industry, which attracted a great migration from
                    Eastern Europe. It was a community where there was a thriving metropolitan area,
                    constantly expanding with a civic consciousness. Because of heavy industry,
                    there was a tremendous amount of soot in the air; but people tolerated that
                    because that meant jobs, that meant security.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go to high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARKS: In Pittsburgh, Fifth Avenue High School. I was president of the student
                    body there and I went from there to the University of Pittsburgh, graduated and
                    went to the Pitt Law School.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The University of Pittsburgh. Was that the Cathedral of
                        Learning at that point or hadn't it reached the cathedral stage yet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARKS: It was a Cathedral of Learning and I had something to do as a student in
                    the program of expanding and developing the Cathedral. I give you this anecdote:
                    Andrew W. Mellon was a patron of the university. He had been Secretary of the
                    Treasury under Coolidge. He served as Ambassador to the Court of Saint James.
                    When he retired he came back to Pittsburgh as the head of the Mellon National
                    Bank., which was the largest financial institution in the East. As a young
                    student I, of course, respected the elderly Mr. Mellon and understood his
                    importance. One day I got a call from the President of the university asking me
                    to come to his office. Since I was president of the student body, it was not an
                    unusual summons. He complimented me on my service to the university and the
                    contributions I had made as a student leader. He said I was now going to be
                    called upon for the most important contribution that any student could ever
                    make. Andrew W. Mellon was coming to visit the Cathedral of Learning for the
                    first time, a building to which he had given tremendous financial support. He
                    wanted to see the building, but he did not wish to have the president of the
                    university or any member of the faculty accompany him. He wanted a student and I
                    was it. So I escorted Mr. Mellon. He was a very taciturn man; conversation was
                    very limited, but he had a great curiosity about student activities, which I
                    explained in detail. As we were leaving he said to me, “Would you have lunch
                    with me?” I accepted quickly. As we approached his car a boy came by yelling,
                    “Extra paper!” In those days extra editions of a newspaper were not uncommon.
                    The headline was “Wiley Post and Will Rogers killed in a plane crash.” This
                    excited Mr Mellon because he knew both of them. He hailed the newsboy, said,
                    “Paper, please.” The boy handed him a paper and Mr. Mellon turned to me and
                    said, “Would you please pay him? I don't have any money.” That was my
                    contribution to the growth of the Cathedral Learning!</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These interviews are focused on America's role in foreign
                        affairs. What were you getting at the University of Pittsburgh? What were
                        you getting about Europe and China and Japan and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARKS: Little or nothing. The student body was not interested in world affairs.
                    We were very parochial. Our parents had gone through the depression. We knew the
                    hardships that a depression could cause. I personally and I'm sure my fellow
                    students were interested in jobs. What would we do when we graduated? How would
                    we make ends meet? And our parents encouraged that. We were never concerned
                    about what Mr. Hitler might be doing and what was happening in Eastern Europe
                    and what was happening with Japan. That was no concern of ours.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You graduated from the University of Pittsburgh when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARKS: 1935.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1935, amidst the depression. Things were pretty difficult
                        at that time. Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARKS: I went to the University of Pittsburgh Law school. I was given a
                    scholarship and I immediately went from the undergraduate to the graduate
                    program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did one specialize in branches of law there or was it
                        pretty general?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARKS: The practice of law was quite different than it is today. You became a
                    lawyer, not a specialist in taxation or divorce or any other particular
                    subject.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find it as a law education?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARKS: I was very pleased to be studying law and I was looking forward to
                    practicing law. Normally I spent at least 16 hours a day in the study of law. I
                    was put on the staff of the Pittsburgh Law Review and devoted a great deal of
                    time - extracurricular - to writing about legal subjects. It was a complete
                    preoccupation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Pittsburgh being the center of the steel industry also
                        the center of the glass industry? Was Corning big there... ?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>MARKS: No, Pittsburgh Plate Glass was there and we were close to Akron, Ohio
                    which was the center of the rubber industry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there sort of a concentration on corporate law and
                        that type of thing or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARKS: There was a concentration on family law, on contract law and on divorce.
                    These were the elementary practices that lawyers had in those days. Corporate
                    law was reserved for a handful of prominent lawyers who represented the Mellon
                    interests. The average lawyer didn't get that business except for small business
                    concerns.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that was off in another world almost.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARKS: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel, coming out of Pittsburgh, the fact that you
                        weren't coming out of the Harvard or Yale Law School? Was that where the
                        Mellons were hiring their people or where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARKS: Absolutely. We understood that. That was a dichotomy. The Harvard/Yale
                    universities were producing the corporate lawyers, and the University of
                    Pittsburgh, although we did have some outstanding corporate lawyers, produced
                    the average practitioner, the family lawyer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is true of most of the law schools anyway. There were
                        just one or two that were sort of producing the...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARKS: That's right. It was Harvard and Yale at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, you finished law school when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARKS: 1938. I was appointed to the faculty. I was first in my class, so I was
                    made the student faculty member and I started to practice law in Pittsburgh at
                    the same time as I was teaching law at the university.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What type of law? Again, was this general law?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>MARKS: I associated myself with a group of lawyers who had small corporate and
                    family practices. There were six lawyers at the time and they gave me research
                    work to do. I accumulated few clients of my own; essentially I worked for
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time the war was looming and I would assume that
                        this would have had quite a repercussion in the Pittsburgh area, because the
                        very basic industries are talking about whether one would be involved in
                        recreating the military.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARKS: You're absolutely correct. Everybody was concerned about what would happen
                    if war broke out in 1939, and after I started to practice I too was concerned. I
                    consulted with some of my faculty friends. Since I was unmarried and very young,
                    what would happen if the draft asked me to be a private in the army? The Dean of
                    the law school was a very dear friend of mine. He said, “They are creating a lot
                    of new agencies in Washington. If you are drafted, I think you can serve your
                    country better as a lawyer in Washington working for the government and these
                    New Deal agencies, than you will as a private in the army. So don't worry about
                    it, just go ahead take things as they come.” So I heeded their advice until
                    1942, when war broke out. Then I came to Washington and I was employed at the
                    Office of Price Administration. Interestingly enough, I was assigned to create a
                    new division which would regulate the price of service trades. That means the
                    service trades - freight forwarding throughout the world, price of laundries,
                    anything that provided a service. I was given the task of creating that division
                    and I chose a very able woman to be Executive Secretary. Her name was Mrs. Pat
                    Nixon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good Heavens!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARKS: Her husband was a lawyer at the Tire Rationing Division. He too was
                    waiting for a call into the service, which eventually came and he entered the
                    Navy. I remembered him as a lawyer for the Office of Price Administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the head of OPA at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARKS: Leon Henderson was the man who ran the agency during most of my period
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Leon Henderson was one of the major names in this American
                        mobilization. What was your impression of him from your perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>MARKS: I was too lowly to work directly with him, but I do think he ran a very
                    efficient agency. He was under wartime pressures to recruit a staff, to get
                    things organized in a minimum amount of time, and he chose some very fine
                    lawyers. Some of the outstanding lawyers of the United States at that time came
                    to work at the OPA and the War Production Board.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't John Kenneth Galbraith there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARKS: Yes - Galbraith was there.</p>

                        something on American history while I've got you there. What was the thrust
                        of working on the service industries? Was there a concern about inflation
                        because of labor being short? Obviously this could get completely out of
                        hand.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARKS: Absolutely. We had to keep inflation under control. At the same time, we
                    recognized that the producers were subject to higher costs and had to be given
                    some incentive in order to stay in business. We would give incremental increases
                    based upon the cost of equipment, and the increasing cost of labor supply; but
                    we held it back as much as we could.</p>

                <p>MARKS: It was a magnificent agency. It was a paragon of virtue. It was run
                    efficiently with dedicated people who worked overtime with minimum salaries. I
                    remember asking Mr. Nixon, after he became president, what his salary was. It
                    was $3800 a year! Mine was $4600. I outranked him, but those were top salaries
                    in those days.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARKS: Office management, typing. She was very efficient, loyal, worked overtime,
                    never complained. I have great respect for her.</p>

                <p>MARKS: I did that for about a year. I soon tired of the work because it really
                    wasn't legal; it was administrative. So I decided I would return to Pittsburgh
                    and wait to be called into the army with the hope that I might be in the Judge
                    Advocate Generals' office. I communicated that desire to one of the lawyers with
                    whom I'd been associated in Pittsburgh and he said, “I'll be coming down to
                    Washington next month. Why don't we wait till I get there? Then we'll talk about
                    when you might come back and the arrangement that we would have.” When I met
                    with him he said that he had been invited to dinner by a classmate, who was an
                    Assistant Attorney-General. He had asked him to bring me along. At that dinner
                    he asked me a great deal about my background and said, “Are you interested in
                    leaving the OPA?” and I said, “Very much.” His next door neighbor was a General
                    Counsel of the Federal Communications Commission. They were engaged in very
                    vital work, essential to the war effort. Communications particularly, the
                    interception of foreign broadcast and other communications material was vital to
                    the war effort. He said, “The FCC is looking for young lawyers. Let me introduce
                    you.” The following day I had an appointment with the General Counsel of the
                    Federal Communications Commission who offered me a job. I accepted.</p>

                <p>MARKS: Well, they regulated all the broadcast and other activities over the

                    a direct relationship to the war effort: it was called the Foreign Broadcast
                    Intelligence Service. We created a system of monitors and recorded all the
                    broadcasts that came in from all over the world. We also recorded other
                    information and supplied it to the intelligence services of the military. It's
                    still in existence by the way.</p>

                    was head of the Office of War Information. People don't realize that there was
                    censorship - voluntary censorship - during the war by the newspapers and the
                    broadcast stations. They restricted themselves to information that did not

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just wondering when all those things of Colonel
                        Robert McCormick's Chicago Tribune at that time who was not - let us say -
                        friendly to the Roosevelt regime; no matter under war or no war, was not
                        always the most docile as far as self censorship. Did you get any
                        reflections of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARKS: No, I dealt with Byron Price, who was head of the Associated Press who ran
                    the Office of War Information, the Office of Censorship really. It was not
                    imposed by the government. The publishers and the broadcasters got together and
                    voluntarily agreed on the code and what they would do. They constituted their
                    own board and disciplined people who broke the rules.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARKS: No, there was a very loose arrangement between the industry and the
                    government. Government trusted the industry representatives to discipline
                    themselves and take care of the problem rather than rely on government
                    regulations. There was a minimum of government control or influence.</p>

                    had a physical difficulty. I had poor eyesight and was not called by the draft.
                    I stayed there until - let's see the cease-fire was 1945 - and I left in January

                <p>MARKS: I entered the practice of law in Washington in the field of
                    communications. I had helped draft the regulations creating a new portion of the
                    spectrum FM broadcasting and I had something to do with the creation or
                    development of the industry that would be called television. I was informed by
                    some of the engineers and those in the official positions, that this was an
                    expanding field. I joined a law firm with my partner Marcus Cohn. We started to
                    practice law January 9th, 1946. For 50 years we have been together in the field
                    of communications.</p>

                <p>MARKS: No, there was no concern. Germany had been defeated, Japan had been
                    defeated, Europe was just waiting for the United States with the Marshall Plan.
                    Foreign broadcasts were of no concern to the United States. They were a concern
                    to Europe. The Voice of America and other broadcast organizations - there were
                    private broadcast organizations by the way - increased their broadcasting to
                    Europe, but it was not commercial because there was nothing to sell.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARKS: Yes. There was a private broadcast station located in Scituate,
                    Massachusetts identified as WRUL: World Radio University of Learning. It was
                    strongly supported by the Christian Science Church. All during the war it had
                    broadcast primarily to the Scandinavian countries, France and Germany advising
                    them of the support that the United States was rendering, and admonishing them
                    to hold out for democracy and for the principals of freedom and liberty. It had
                    no commercials. The Governor of Massachusetts at that time was Leverett
                    Saltonstall, who later became a U.S. Senator. He was present one night at the
                    studio when the station broadcast an appeal to the Norwegians operating ships at
                    sea, not to surrender the fleet, but to take the ships to another port other
                    than Narvik. He saw the power of radio.</p>

                    had their own thing. The BBC had their own schedule. They were conscious of each

                <p>MARKS: I'll relate that story to you. It has been printed many times. I was in
                    New York representing a client who was selling a radio/television newspaper. We
                    were in the boardroom of the bank, and seated around the table were accountants,
                    lawyers and business people. I was in charge of the agenda. At a quarter to 12
                    the phone rang and the secretary said, “Mr. Marks, the President of the United
                    States wants to talk to you.” We talked regularly. I took the call and he said,
                    “How ya doing!?” I explained where I was, and he said, “That's fine, at 12
                    o'clock I'm having a press conference announcing that you're going to be the
                    Director of the United States Information Agency.” I said, “You can't do that to
                    me!” I was stuttering because I didn't have any concept of what was involved.
                    “Why?” I said, “Well we have a farm in Middleburg. Today my wife is down there
                    and when she hears the news on the radio, she'll think that I've gone out of my
                    mind!” I couldn't think of any other explanation. He said, “Well then I'll hold
                    it for one day.” But he didn't. He announced it! Carl Rowan had resigned and the
                    President didn't want any hiatus, and so he announced my appointment without my
                    consent. When I came back to Washington the following day, I met with him and I
                    said, “I've thought about it. This really disrupts my life, but I'll take it.”
                    He said, “I want you to understand that this is a very vital position. We're
                    engaged in a war in Vietnam. Communications is vital to the success of that

                    that table because I think public diplomacy is as important as military action”.
                    He said, “Now when you are sworn in, I want you to go up and see President
                    Eisenhower, who has told me of the importance of public diplomacy, and I want
                    you to get some guidance from him.” So I subsequently did see President
                    Eisenhower, who made some very important statements to me. He said that one of
                    the great failures of his administration was his total reliance upon military
                    and little on public diplomacy. He said to me, “What's your budget?” and I said,
                    “$200,000.000”. He said, “You should have a billion dollars.” I said, “No, I
                    don't think I could spend it.” He said, “You'll learn.” But he gave me some very
                    valuable advice on the role of public diplomacy, the State Department, the
                    military and how we should interact. He said, “The minds of people abroad are
                    more important to us than subduing them physically; so you should engage in a
                    vast program of cultural exchange and information. People should understand what
                    the United States stands for; what democracy means; how free enterprise works.
                    These are the topics we should be talking about.” And since the Marshall Plan
                    had made Europe economically viable, he said, “We should emphasize the
                    importance of foreign aid.” President Eisenhower inspired me.</p>

                    President Eisenhower created the United States Information Agency. I asked him,
                    “Why should there be a separate, independent USIA rather than have it in the
                    State Department?”(phone rings)</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARKS: Yes. President Eisenhower explained to me that if the United States
                    Information Agency was part of the State Department, its recommendations at the
                    national security level or at the presidential level would have to be filtered
                    through an Assistant Secretary of State or through the Secretary of State, who
                    couldn't be as cogent because he was not a specialist; he was not familiar
                    enough. It was important that the most experienced express views on public
                    diplomacy at the highest levels. He said, “For that reason I want you to have a
                    seat at the National Security table. I think that you should be involved in the
                    proceedings at that level. You should know what they are doing so you can
                    translate the views of the U.S. Government to foreign audiences.” I did

                    will surprise you by telling you that the salaries at that time paid to
                    newspaper people - the broadcasters in government - were higher than they were
                    in the private industry. To illustrate: I needed somebody in Rome. I knew a
                    correspondent who had served in Rome as correspondent to the Vatican, and also
                    to Italy for over 20 years. I think he was either with the United Press or the
                    Associated Press. I called him expecting to have some trouble when I offered him
                    the opportunity of coming to the government. He was intrigued by it and he said,
                    “What does it pay? I told him, and he said, “My God, that's 10% more than I'm
                    getting now!” and he accepted it immediately. So we got some high class people
                    from the information world. We also got some wonderful academics, who were
                    specialists in particular areas of cultural exchange. I created a Super Cultural
                    Officer for Paris, London and Tokyo, because I wanted those countries to
                    understand the culture of the United States; that we were not just a
                    materialistic society. We sponsored arts, music, dance and all the other phases
                    of performing in graphic and cultural arts. It made a great impact. To answer
                    your question - I found a very able and dedicated group of people, very

                <p>MARKS: Because President Johnson understood the importance of information and
                    cultural exchange, he at an early date had Dean Rusk meet with me. Dean Rusk was
                    Secretary of State. We discussed our relationship. Every morning at the
                    Secretary's meeting with his Assistant Secretaries I was there, and was called
                    upon and expressed my views. There was complete coordination at the top level.
                    We translated that to the Assistant Secretary level; in other words an Assistant
                    Director of USIA met regularly with the Assistant Secretary of State for that
                    area. The same thing was true with Bob McNamara as Secretary of Defense. I had
                    no friction with the State Department. I had great cooperation. Let me give you
                    an illustration of how that worked. One morning, about three o'clock, the phone
                    rang. It was Dean Rusk. He said, “Leonard, I want you to get dressed and come
                    down and see me.” I knew that it had to be very critical. As I walked in to his

                <p>MARKS: There was great emphasis on cultural exchange because of Senator Bill
                    Fulbright. The Fulbright program was expanded. He didn't understand the
                    importance of information. He didn't support that role, but he strongly
                    supported the role of cultural exchanges. We had no problems with
                    appropriations; we expanded very rapidly. I don't think we had any real problems
                    of recruiting people, because the academic community was very anxious to get
                    into the international field. I could draft professors and deans from the

                        academic world seemed to be going on almost a confrontation course. How did

                    didn't support the war effort, as you know from their protests on college
                    campuses. There were headlines in the newspapers reflecting their dissent. We
                    did not enter into domestic activities, since by statute we were prohibited from
                    getting involved in explaining anything to domestic audiences. Our role was to
                    be the spokesmen for foreign audiences overseas - but there is an inevitable
                    relationship between domestic and foreign. If they protest on the campus of a
                    college in the United States, it would be reflected in the headlines in Asia,
                    Africa, Europe, and everywhere around the world, so we had to deal with that. We
                    did the best we could. We tried to explain to foreign audiences what the issues
                    were in Vietnam. It was difficult. We sent emissaries from the academic world,
                    who didn't necessarily agree with the campus views, to lecture at universities
                    in Europe, Asia, and Africa. We circulated materials, articles, interviews; we
                    did the best we could. I won't tell you it was very successful; it was helpful,

                    illustrate how we handled some difficulties. Senator Fulbright was outraged
                    because I created a program to get foreign journalists, influential journalists,
                    to go to Vietnam to see for themselves how we were handling the war, and what
                    the attitude of the local population was. I solicited them to come to Vietnam. I
                    would provide them with transportation. I would facilitate their arrangements by
                    creating interviews with them for whoever they wished, but I would not have
                    anything to do with the content of their writings. Fulbright was very upset by
                    that and summoned me to a hearing. He asked me to explain the program, which I
                    did. He said, “You have made great emphasis on the fact that you're interested
                    in their factual reporting, not in their opinions. What is the difference
                    between a fact and an opinion?” The good Lord was with me. I was inspired and
                    said, “Senator, I'll gladly illustrate that to you. Today - whatever the date is
                    - I'm testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee; that's a fact.
                    In my opinion, it's a very prestigious body,” he says, “You're wrong. It's a
                    fact.” It brought down the house with laughter, and it made everybody aware that
                    the dichotomy between a fact and an opinion was a very difficult one. At least
                    we were conscious of our responsibilities to try to present the facts. It broke
                    up the meeting; there were no further repercussions. I really didn't have any

                    opposition of that nature. If there was, it was subdued because they were a very

                </p>
                <p>MARKS: Yes, indeed. I've been in Washington for most of my life. As a lawyer I
                    dealt with Congress. I've dealt with administrative agencies. I know something
                    about getting along with people who control your destiny. I was very conscious
                    of the fact that John Rooney was a key player, and so when I was sworn in at the
                    White House I personally called John Rooney and said, “It would be a great honor
                    and privilege for me if you would come to my swearing-in.” He did. When I was
                    sworn in, the President invited a few people into his office, including John
                    Rooney. And John Rooney said, “Lyndon, Marks is gonna be a success! This is the
                    first time that I've been invited to the White House for a swearing-in. He's got
                    my support.” Now before an appropriations hearing I would go up and brief John
                    Rooney on what I needed. I explained to him in detail how I arrived at my
                    figures. I said, “John, there is a little fat in here. I think it's justified.”
                    He said, “You know I've got to cut,” and I said, “That's why it's fat.” He knew
                    at that time what I actually needed. We had an understanding and I got what I
                    needed. There was only one subject with which we had difficulty:
                    entertainment.</p>

                    “Now you spend it on Coca-Cola and things like that.” I said, “John, you know I
                    have offices in 100 and some countries. What you're giving me is maybe a dollar
                    a week for each.” He said, “The State Department has $1,000,000 parked for you
                    in un-vouchee funds. It's for what you need.” I had few problems with John
                    Rooney. It worked out very well, because I was conciliatory. I recognized his

                        the Director would sit to one side and allow the assistant directors to take
                        all the heat and often get into real trouble, because Rooney could nail them
                        by saying, “Why don't you know this?” and he would find some obscure fact

                    tried to acquaint myself with all the detail...but there were some things I
                    didn't know. I could legitimately say that I would find out. Rooney was
                    impressed by that, as were other members of the Committee, and it worked very
                    well. And I refused to have anybody else participate in the determination of the
                    policy. I did it. If there was criticism, I wanted to get blamed. If there was

                    European Russian area, and I just couldn't take a newsman or an academic. I
                    needed someone with the seasoning and background of the Foreign Service. I went
                    to Dean Rusk and said, “Do you have one outstanding guy? Have you got someone
                    you can lend me?” and he suggested Dick Davis. He was reluctant to come over to
                    USIA. The agency had no standing. There were no retirement benefits. You would
                    lose certain prestige on the ladder of the State Department. I said to him, “If
                    you come over and help me for two years, I promise you you won't get hurt, and
                    you'll be appointed Ambassador to a significant country.” His ability was
                    apparent and his performance was outstanding. At the end of the period he was
                    made Ambassador to Poland. I will take great pride in saying that I went to Dean
                    Rusk and I told him of my promise. I thought that he would give some attention
                    to it and he did. He deserved that post. He deserved to be ambassador to Russia,
                    but political considerations, I think, took over there.</p>

                    never be delivered. There was nothing we could do about it except protest. There
                    was nothing we could do to stop the jamming, even though it was illegal and
                    contrary to the Treaty. Our relations were very tense with the Soviet Union, and

                    because they were determined. Their people would not hear anything about

                <p>MARKS: It was one of the divisions, and I recognized that it was most important
                    because it had so much public attention. We couldn't just have anybody running
                    the Voice of America. When I came in I looked around and I thought, “The most
                    able newsman I know is John Chancellor,” who was with NBC. I went to the
                    President and said, “If I ask John Chancellor to be head of the Voice of
                    America, will you go along?” He said, “Whatever you want.” “He may not do it for
                    me, he'll do it for you.” “What do you want me to do?” I said, “I want you to
                    invite him to a weekend at Camp David and during that weekend point out to him
                    how vital it is that he come and help our administration.” He did, and that's
                    the only reason why John left NBC and a very lucrative contract, to serve as
                    head of the Voice of America for two years. During his period nobody questioned
                    the objectivity of the performance of the Voice of America, because they had the
                    highest respect for John. I didn't interfere with whatever he wanted to do. He
                    told the truth, he emphasized the subjects which he thought were newsworthy. As

                    occasion I was greeted by the inevitable charts of briefers. They gave me all
                    the propaganda about how well they were doing, and I said, “Look, give me that
                    pointer,” and I just arbitrarily pointed to a spot on the map. I remember the
                    name was Bac Liev. I said, “I want to go there and I want to see what we are
                    doing. I understand we have four people there, we have a daily newspaper, and I
                    want to see what we are doing.” “Oh, you can't go, because the Viet Cong has
                    that under control.” “I'm going! You get me a helicopter and I'm going!” So we
                    went. I found a village that had no paved streets. We were publishing a daily
                    newspaper, but the rate of literacy was maybe 10%. I found out that people got
                    their information at night, when troubadours had been hired to entertain at the
                    village center, the village churches or whatever it was. They improvised songs
                    telling the people what was happening and also telling them to save rubber, and
                    be careful about the efforts of the Viet Cong. I found that the women would go
                    down to the market in the morning and wash their clothes and buy their fish, and
                    they gossiped with each other. Nobody listened to the radio; very few had radio
                    sets. So I cut our program completely, and I hired troubadours to tell our

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, the six day war. There is a very strong Israeli lobby
                        with APAC I think it is. Did you find that you had to be careful about
                        dealing with the broadcast to the Arabs and all that because of the strong
                        Israeli - pro Israeli - policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARKS: It never really came into it. The six day war was a period of tension,
                    because it might be another major war, but it lapsed at the end of six days.
                    That was not a major controversy for us.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did France cause problems? I mean the French always seem
                        to be - particularly in the field of culture - we seem to be going on really
                        quite opposing sides. Did France raise much of a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARKS: Yes, de Gaulle told us to get out of NATO. That presented an information
                    problem. “What do we do, complain or act better?” Lyndon Johnson was masterful
                    in that. De Gaulle gave us a very short deadline and I remember the military at
                    the National Security Council meeting said, “We can't meet the deadline.” The
                    President answered, “You'll meet the deadline, regardless of what it takes. I
                    want Dean Rusk to go back to the Foreign Ministry and ask them - when we remove
                    all of our equipment - 'Should we dig our people out of the graves?'”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: World War I or II?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARKS: That's right. This caused a hushed silence. He said, “I'm serious! I want
                    them to realize what they are doing.” But we never reflected any animosity in
                    our broadcast or in our relationships.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find with the BBC, particularly with Vietnam, that
                        we kept growing in different directions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARKS: No, we had regular coordination meetings. We met twice a year, once in
                    London and once in Washington to discuss what each of us was doing. Each went
                    our own ways in terms of programming, but we coordinated our efforts. There was
                    no controversy. There was no animosity between us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So how about Canada, any problem with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARKS: None, none with Canada.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Greek-Turkish issues? Did these ever raise much
                        of a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARKS: They never came up. At the desk level there were some irritants.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Northern Ireland?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARKS: No.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: United Nations - was the UN trying to do things that we
                        didn't like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARKS: No, we had a pretty good relationship. Ambassador Goldberg was the
                    ambassador to the UN at the time, and we worked very closely with him. The U.S.
                    dominated the United Nations. I can't recall any major controversy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about within your agency? The State Department had a
                        lot of trouble, because we would examine and approve young Foreign Service
                        officers and then say, “And by the way, your first assignment is going to be
                        out in the boondocks in Vietnam.” What about in USIA? Did you find a morale
                        problem or an administrative problem dealing with Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARKS: No, we hired some wonderful JOTs. Junior officers' training courses were
                    important, and we chose people from the Peace Corps, and those who had the
                    exposure to foreign cultures and were eager to travel into remote places. We
                    didn't send them all to Ouagadougou, but those who went didn't complain. I found
                    that morale was pretty good. We had a wonderful Personnel Officer, Lionel
                    Mosley.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know time is about to run out, so I wanted to ask; you
                        left USIA in 1969?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARKS: January, when the Nixon administration came in. I actually departed in
                    November, after the election.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm told by people I've talked to within the business,
                        that there was quite a change in USIA during the early Nixon administration.
                        How did you feel about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARKS: It was a different agency and it had different goals. I had no direct
                    relationship with my successors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Frank Shakespeare was the first...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARKS: Frank Shakespeare was an advocate on the right side of the ledger. He had
                    ideological objectives, and he had a close relationship with Nixon and the right
                    wing of the Republican Party. I won't say he did anything improper; but he
                    certainly changed the emphasis of the agency. Whether it was good or bad I'm not
                    going to comment on, but it was a different agency.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Over the years have you sort of kept a benevolent eye on
                        the agency?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARKS: Oh, absolutely. I've had a close relationship with Charlie Wick, for
                    example. He consulted me regularly. I've gone on missions for the agency. For
                    example, Charlie Wick asked me to go to Moscow with him to protest the jamming
                    of the Voice of America, which I did. We did it at the highest level. Also I
                    went to Sri Lanka and negotiated a treaty there for the creation of the Voice of
                    America station. So I've had a close relationship. I have great respect - I
                    regret that there has been a cut in the budget and the de-emphasis on public
                    diplomacy, which I think we will regret some day.</p>

                <p>MARKS: Good, you've met the deadline. Play it back a little bit to make sure it's
                    working.</p>
