                <p>DEPUTY UNDER SECRETARY CHARLES BOHLEN</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Paige Mulhollan, LBJ Library</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: November 20, 1968</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's identify you, sir. You're Charles E. Bohlen,
                        currently Deputy Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, and you
                        have held this position since what date, sir?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: Since about the middle of February of this year [1968]. I came back on
                    leave from Paris just about a year ago, and I was spending my leave very happily
                    and quietly when I got word from Dean Rusk he wanted to see me in Washington. I
                    came up from the eastern shore of Maryland, and Dean Rusk informed me that the
                    President had decided that he wanted me to come back here to deal primarily with
                    Russian affairs, which is in effect what I've done; although this job has other
                    duties connected with it. It's the center point of liaison with the Pentagon on
                    a working level and with CIA and with AEC. I'm also the State Department
                    representative, or rather the substitute representative because in most cases
                    there is a higher official involved, on the Space Council and on the Marine
                    Council. So I have to deal with problems dealing with the sea bed, with matters
                    affecting space, but then primarily my work has been in the Russian field. To
                    prepare I was told by Secretary Rusk that when the President thinks about Russia
                    there are only three names in the Department of State that he thought of; one
                    was Lewellyn Thompson, who is presently Ambassador to Moscow; the other was Foy
                    Kohler, who is retired and down in the University of Miami; and the third was
                    myself. The two others were not available. I had gone to see President Johnson
                    to pay my courtesy visit to him being an Ambassador back on leave in about the
                    middle of November.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had served, immediately prior to this, as Ambassador
                        to France during the entire time Mr. Johnson had been President?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: Yes, I was appointed by President Kennedy to France, and I got there in
                    October 1962, and I was happily ensconced there, perfectly prepared and willing
                    indeed to spend the rest of this Administration in Paris and then resign at the
                    end of that in a suitable form of exit; but this was changed by the President's
                    wish.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a little bit about the problems of your current
                        position as Deputy Under Secretary. As you indicated, you're perhaps chiefly
                        responsible for liaison with the Defense Department and others. There has
                        been a great deal of discussion during Johnson's Presidency that the State
                        Department has been pushed aside in the conduct of American foreign policy
                        by the Defense Department and others. Do you think that's an accurate
                        appraisal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: I have seen no evidence of it since I have been back here. Now, of
                    course, you've got to remember that the Vietnam affair has always been handled
                    specially. The President is personally involved in that, all of the military
                    dispositions don't fall within my purview at all. And I don't discuss Vietnam
                    with the Pentagon or with the Joint Chiefs in any form, shape, or manner,
                    because this as I say has required special handling. But as far as I can see the
                    Department of State, which is in truth really personified by the Secretary of
                    State, has been right in every single thing that I can see, that I have any
                    knowledge of. The State Department is very heavily involved, and the relations
                    with the Pentagon as far as I can see are excellent.</p>
                <p>One of the advantages, you know, of having been around government for as long as
                    I have is you tend to know people, and I know Paul Nitze very, very well
                    indeed.</p>
                <p>And I know Clark Clifford, less well of course, but then I don't have many
                    dealings with him; and I have a good deal of dealings with Paul Nitze; Dick
                    Helms I've known for many years, I know him well and have great admiration for
                    him. So it is advantageous to have been around here for quite awhile, and the
                    first of March next year will be forty years since I joined this business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1929 in Prague was your first assignment, I think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: My first assignment was in Prague in the fall of 1929. I left the United
                    States just about two weeks or three weeks before the crash of 1929.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That wasn't a bad time to leave, was it? In regard to the
                        Defense Department, does the cooperation you talk about extend pretty well
                        into the field at the mission level, the Embassy level?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>BOHLEN: Oh, yes, when I was in Paris, for example, there was never any problem at
                    all. We had excellent relations with all the military in France, and the
                    attach�s have a special relationship, which is true all over the world. Attach�s
                    are members of the Ambassador's staff, and as such are subject to his orders.
                    Then of course, in France, when I arrived there, we had a considerable
                    contingent of American forces. Well, they really were more logistic or air
                    squadron forces, photography forces, but we had a number of bases in France, and
                    these were closed down after President de Gaulle made his decision in March of
                    1966 that he wanted the American troops out. And I must say that that was a very
                    impressive job that the American military did under President Johnson's
                    orders—he gave the orders to carry this out and carry it out promptly and
                    efficiently. And indeed it was. We got out of France with dispatch and dignity.
                    It really, I think, impressed the French enormously that this so-called deadline
                    which de Gaulle mentioned, which he really had no legal right to name or
                    anything like that, was met with complete—.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There is no large number of cases of military personnel
                        attached to Embassies who resist the orders of the Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: Well, we had the regular setup of the attach� system which, as I say, has
                    been well-defined and established for many, many years. And then you have
                    EURCOM, which was completely out from under the Embassy, had nothing to do with
                    it, which was the European Command American Army. And then, of course, during
                    this period also you had the NATO Council there which was a military committee
                    and all the appurtenances of the NATO. This was moved to Brussels in the fall of
                    '67.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned you haven't been engaged in consultation
                        regarding Vietnam, so perhaps you haven't had a chance in this job to get
                        into the difficulties of coordinating military policy with political
                        policy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: No, I haven't done this at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because we don't have a military policy going on in that
                        area.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: I must say that under me here is a large section that is called GPM—G is
                    a symbol for this office, PM is political-military affairs—headed by Phil
                    Farley, who used to be number 2 in the NATO delegation to Harlan Cleveland in
                    Paris, and who is a first-class officer. And he has a rather large group of
                    people under him who really work in direct liaison with the Pentagon at all
                    levels, and he is so good in his work that it's only very rarely that he has to
                    bring a problem to me. I have supervisory responsibility over him, which makes
                    it a very satisfactory form of work.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does military policy frequently create problems that
                        involve other political decisions, such as arms sales? That's what comes to
                        mind.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: Yes, that is an intricate subject, and it includes the problems of the
                    U.S. arms sales which is handled by a special fellow—Henry Kuss over there in
                    the Defense Department handles it. Occasionally it does involve some political
                    problems. If you sell arms to one country and this worries another country which
                    happens to have some sort of dispute with them. The classical illustration is
                    India and Pakistan, and the fact that when it appears there are some American
                    tanks, say, going to Pakistan, then they think we've engineered it, but
                    sometimes we haven't, although I think we do have a residual responsibility for
                    any arms that originate in the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does the White House ever get involved in problems like
                        that, where you get two different Departments with perhaps different points
                        of view?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: Since I have been back, there hasn't been anything that I know of that
                    has required White House solution over the dispute, but that certainly does
                    happen. The White House was final arbiter of the whole thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But I was driving toward whether or not you've encountered
                        Mr. Johnson taking a position in this particular matter or not.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: No. I can't think of any instance since I have been back where President
                    Johnson has had to take that sort of a position between the two contending
                    Departments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the CIA? You mentioned them in addition to
                        Defense?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: CIA and its relationship has been excellent. I know Dick Helms very well
                    and I knew Rufus Taylor, who's over there as number two, and he calls me on the
                    secure phone frequently about something, some particular problem or other. No,
                    as a matter of fact, this job has been, as far as I can see, that the
                    relationships have stayed with the various parts of the government seem to be in
                    excellent order.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's good to hear. I'm afraid the State Department
                        doesn't have a very good press sometimes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>BOHLEN: Oh, well, the State Department never does. You just find out one thing.
                    The State Department does not have a constituency in the United States
                    politically.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that doesn't help them any in a lot of places.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: It has always been a natural whipping boy, and I suppose it always will.
                    In the first place, since you've raised the subject, it doesn't have any
                    constituency. By this I mean that it does not employ thousands of people the way
                    the big Departments do all over the United States. Its operations are
                    concentrated in Washington and abroad and nowhere else.</p>
                <p>Secondly, since it deals with the foreigner, it is the State Department
                    representative that has to go before Congress and in effect present the case for
                    the foreign country which in their eye somehow makes them look as though they
                    are proponents of the foreign position and not that of an American one. It is
                    the way things inevitably work out, it doesn't have anything to do with any
                    particular sympathy. But no one else is going to present, say, the case for any
                    country you want to name. It's got to be made clear why they need this aid or
                    why they need this military assistance and all this. And you have to sort of
                    argue their case. Now, in general, you know, in any country where patriotism
                    sometimes has a tinge of chauvinism in it, that anybody who does this is
                    regarded as un-American, and this is the case particularly for the operation of
                    this Department, where nine-tenths of its work is abroad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The claim that's frequently made when they talk about what
                        has recently been called the “sad state of State,” is, that it's
                        unadministerable. Does this have some accuracy in it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: Well, there's no doubt about it, the American system of separation of
                    powers was not designed for the conduct of foreign affairs. It was designed for
                    the conduct of non-foreign affairs, really. If you look at the Constitution and
                    you really read the contemporary writings and opinions that are expressed, you
                    can see that one of the great anxieties of the Founding Fathers, so-called, was
                    that this young, struggling republic would get itself involved in foreign
                    affairs before it was ready to do anything about it. And, therefore, a certain
                    amount of safeguards were built in, but this was not the reason for the
                    separation of powers, which was to avoid the concentration of too much power in
                    too few hands. But it certainly has not been set up, as I say, for the conduct
                    of foreign relations, and it sometimes has cost the American taxpayer a good
                    deal of money because of the time that it takes to get measures through
                    Congress. In a cabinet system of government, such as the British, the French,
                    Germans—any of them have—as long as the government is in power, it is both
                    legislative and executive.</p>

                        an accurate assessment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: Well, in a way it is. You see, the Foreign Service of the United States
                    has grown so unbelievably in the last twenty years, and the requirements for
                    admission are so high, and yet an awful lot of the work—I'd say fully 50-percent
                    of the work in the Foreign Service abroad—is really routine work. And this is
                    something that no one has licked. You've got to have high requirements to enter
                    because any one of the young people coming in could rise to positions of
                    responsibility. And when you're abroad, even a Vice Consul can do things that
                    can harm or help the reputation and standing of the United States in a given
                    country. But then when you get this high degree of qualifications, education and
                    so forth, and then you have to apply them to really routine tasks, you get a
                    certain amount of discontent. It's bad for morale. For example, when I joined
                    the Foreign Service in 1929, the total officer corps of the Foreign Service,
                    including Ministers and Ambassadors, was 732.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is it today?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: Now, there are 3,500 officers in the Foreign Service proper. I couldn't
                    tell you how many there are in the USIA, or how many there are in AID, but
                    certainly the total must run up around 7-8,000 at least. Now, they're not all
                    competing in the same personnel system because the 3,500 are the ones who are
                    really, so to speak, competing; but you can see the enormous increase in the
                    broadening of the base, and this does create problems which have not yet been
                    licked.</p>

                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>BOHLEN: Yes, to some extent, and all this. And how do you deal with the whole
                    problem of it. In other words, you've almost—some people think you've almost—got
                    the creation of a Mexican army, with everybody a general. Everybody who is taken
                    in has the educational basis and the character abilities theoretically to become
                    the highest level you can get into, which I suppose would be an Ambassador to an
                    important country. And yet, as I say, over 50-percent of the tasks that you
                    perform, particularly in the earlier years, are very routine.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do Foreign Service Officers generally make career

                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: Could be, it very often is a Foreign Service Officer, very often it
                    isn't. The Bureau of Personnel—the personnel system is a very extensive one
                    here—it's under the general overall direction of the Deputy Under Secretary for
                    Administration who is a Foreign Service Officer. He was brought into the Foreign
                    Service—I've forgotten—about ten years ago.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: I don't think so. This is one of the great theses of many people, and in
                    1956, I think it was, '55-'56, the so-called Wriston Report merged the Foreign
                    Service Officers and the Home Service Officers which I think in the opinion of
                    almost everybody in the Foreign Service, and still in my opinion, was a great
                    mistake, for the reason that nine-tenths of the people who are in the Home
                    Service don't want to go abroad; they are people who live in Washington and have
                    gotten acquainted with the jungle of this town and know their way around; and
                    they were sort of pushed into the Foreign Service. But anyway, this was done,
                    and I don't really think it helped the Foreign Service as a whole.</p>
                <p>

                        now called the Rostow Operation. Were you analogous in some ways?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: Not at all. I had an office over here and an office in the White House. I
                    was just strictly a liaison officer working with President Roosevelt and then
                    President Truman; but President Truman had a different idea of the function of
                    things. When Jimmy Byrnes became Secretary of State, then this whole thing just
                    disappeared. But I think it was important when Roosevelt and Hopkins were
                    around. Harry Hopkins was the one that set it up.</p>

                <p>BOHLEN: Not particularly, no. Anyway, we are getting pretty far from Johnson on
                    this thing.</p>
                <p>

                        preempt your material here. I was driving toward this—the growth of this
                        sort of new agency in national security affairs, advisory staff in the White
                        House, which started under Kennedy and has expanded or perhaps changed in
                        some ways under Johnson. How does this relate to the State Department in
                        accomplishing its task?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: Well, I wasn't here, you see, except for a year. I was here when Kennedy
                    came in in '61, and I stayed on until about a year-and-a-half and had an
                    opportunity to see it because the man who headed it up, who was sort of a
                    foreign affairs or security officer of the White House was McGeorge Bundy, who
                    was a remarkable man, I think, and a very sensible one. And I think he saw all
                    of the dangers of his job which could have been to encroach on the State
                    Department's prerogatives, but as far as I could see—and I knew him very well
                    and had a great deal of business with him when I was here before—he was
                    successful in avoiding this sort of stuff. This was not always true of some of
                    the others over there. I don't want to name any names, but there was in the
                    group—.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're welcome to name any names. I'd just be delighted
                        for you to.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: No, I don't particularly want to name any names. But there were some of
                    them who were sort of new and eager and a little bit swollen with their own
                    importance by being in the White House. This is one of the problems that you get
                    in almost every new Administration. One of the things was that the Kennedy
                    Administration was differently organized than its predecessor, President
                    Eisenhower. But let me state here that during Eisenhower's Administrations, I
                    was abroad almost the whole time—I was in Moscow, went out to Moscow in April
                    1953, or at least I arrived there in April 1953; and then I went from there to
                    the Philippines and came back and was here in the Department for about a year
                    with Christian Herter, then Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you think the same thing is true of the Rostow
                        operation as was true with the Bundy one before it—that is, of trying not to
                        impose—</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>BOHLEN: Yes, I don't get the idea that Walt Rostow encroaches at all on Defense's
                    prerogatives. I think Dean Rusk, of course, has established himself a position
                    in the whole governmental setup. It seems to me that you don't see any signs of
                    them trying to push the Department of State around with Rusk. Of course Rusk,
                    whom I have the greatest admiration for, I knew him when he was here before with
                    General Marshall, and even his best friend would not claim for him a great
                    administrative ability. He's not interested in the administration of the
                    Department of State, but he himself has a very high standing in the
                    Administration; and it seems to me that he handles all of his problems with the
                    White House and all that—that level of foreign policy—in a very, very excellent
                    way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again you'll accuse me of getting away from Johnson, but
                        it has a lot to do with the Foreign Service under Johnson and before as
                        well. You yourself were one of the victims of the attacks that have been
                        made on the Americanism in McCarthy times.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: McCarthy was a product of sixteen years of being out of office. This is
                    what it was. And therefore McCarthy came along—and there's no point, he's dead
                    now, so let him stay in his grave—but this was a purely sort of a
                    opportunistic—I mean he didn't have any deep conviction on this stuff about
                    Communism in government. The story that I believe to be true was that there was
                    a luncheon held across from the Mayflower Hotel at which there was a Catholic
                    priest, a fired correspondent from the old Times Herald in Washington, and
                    somebody else, and McCarthy. And McCarthy was complaining of the fact that he'd
                    been 10 years, something like that, in the Senate and hadn't made a name for
                    himself, at all, and somebody mentioned the fact that Communists in government
                    was a good thesis, and the correspondent offered to write him a speech to be
                    delivered in Wheeling, West Virginia, which he did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. That's the start of it. In 1950.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: And it grew and it grew and it grew, and as I say, part of it—the reason
                    that he got a certain amount of support from the Republican Party is that the
                    Republican Party was just avid for power at that time. And the country for the
                    first time in history was a little bit scared by the fact that you could have
                    war with a country that could reach you, namely the Soviet Union. And then the
                    discovery of a number of Communists in government all fed this thing. And for
                    the first time in the history of the United States the people felt alarmed. And
                    this is what produced this disagreeable and very unfortunate aberration known as
                    McCarthyism because I think we're still living with some of the
                    consequences.</p>

                <p>BOHLEN: I know from some of my children that it is apparently, it's considered a
                    rebirth of McCarthyism to even discuss the Communist problem as such in many
                    universities.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: If you talk about that there is such a thing as a Communist menace and
                    the Soviet Union, then it's known as McCarthyism.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: I would say no. I wouldn't say it had a long-term effect. I think it had
                    much more an effect over the period on the national consciousness, particularly
                    in the academic world because that was one of his targets, you know; he was
                    always after professors. I think this had a certain effect. I remember telling
                    Senator [Karl] Mundt [RSD.] at the time when the McCarthy thing was on, saying,
                    you know, this thing is going to make it impossible for us to do any serious job
                    of analysis of the Communist problem. It's going to so sicken the people when
                    they turn against McCarthy on the idea that it's going to make anything that's
                    anti-Communist very discredited.</p>

                <p>BOHLEN: There were some victims. There were some very, very bad cases of rank
                    injustices that were done, I think, due to McCarthy. One of them, of course, is
                    John Davies, who used to be one of the best Foreign Service Officers we had. But
                    because of the pressures of the time and things like that, he was let go—not on
                    any grounds of disloyalty but simply on the grounds of that they called “bad
                    judgment” about China. But damn it, all of the judgments seemed to be accurate.
                    He said that the Communists, the way things stood in China, were going to win
                    their fight, and they did.</p>

                    it. No, these were Senators who really got—McCarthy was behind this. And they
                    had been dining out on the iniquities of Yalta. Then when I got up before the
                    committee and was asked questions about it, I told them what I thought about
                    it—that there were no iniquities at Yalta. And this upset some of them a
                    little.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And can still upset some of them, I think, or those who

                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: Well, that has died out a lot. A very funny thing—the Republicans in
                    thinking that they would find an enormous paydirt to discredit the Roosevelt
                    Administration, rushed the publication of the Yalta papers, I don't know,
                    several years ahead of the normal date.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN:You know, when it came out, it was the wettest [indistinguishable word]
                    you have ever seen. There wasn't a Goddamn thing in it that was discreditable at
                    all. If and when I write a book, which I think I probably will when I get out of
                    here, a large part of it will deal with proceedings and what really happened at
                    Yalta, although it's all in the thing that was published.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to Russia, as you said, in April 1957. Just out
                        of curiosity really, what was the Russian reaction to McCarthyism?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: They were very much against it, at least publicly. It was too easy a
                    thing, and they thought the United States was going fascist and all this sort of
                    stuff. You've always got to remember that the Russians—we had been public enemy
                    number one as far as Soviet propaganda has been concerned ever since about June
                    1944, and that this is part of the normal procedure. They would never give the
                    U.S. a favorable break ever, and they still don't. We are the chief opponent of
                    what they are trying to do, although often what they are trying to do is not
                    what they profess to be trying to do in the sense that they are a Communist
                    country, that is to say, they are run by a Communist party; and ideology still
                    plays an enormous part in their—but not as much in their foreign affairs, as
                    much as one might think. It's a very complicated subject, and I don't want to
                    get into it. I'll save that for my book.</p>

                        will be a major part of any work you write. What about the general topic,
                        and Mr. Johnson has been involved in this, of summitry? You've probably been
                        at more summit conferences than anybody alive.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: Well, I know. The Secretary of State wrote an article for Foreign Affairs
                    before he was Secretary of State in which he disapproved of summitry.</p>
                <p>He said it was a bad way of doing business, and it is a bad way of doing
                    business. And naturally anybody who has been in this business as long as I have,
                    you develop some professional distortions, if you want to call it that, or
                    perhaps experience and knowledge of things a little better than you might if you
                    didn't have it. And certainly the orderly processes of diplomacy would best be
                    carried out by your Ambassadors and by the quiet processes. But given the nature
                    of the Soviet structure where only the very top can make decisions, can do
                    anything, I think summitry is inevitable.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: The difficulty is, and any Western leader ought to be fully aware of it,
                    the fact that you have a free public opinion in your own country means that you
                    are under a certain amount of disability when you meet with a dictator who
                    doesn't have the same problem. Because it's very much harder for a Western
                    President, for example, coming from our society or from that of any of the
                    democratic societies in Western Europe, to have a meeting that's a failure.
                    There's always the temptation to try to reach some form of agreement; the
                    dictator doesn't have that at all. But simply because the Soviet structure is
                    built that way, there's not much point in trying to do business, say, with
                    [Andrei] Gromyko, whereas you can occasionally with Kosygin. This was truer in
                    the days of Stalin than I think it is now when you really have a collective
                    leadership.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does the personality compatibility or incompatibility
                        sometimes loom very important?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: Very little. I think it can work in a negative sense if some guy, if
                    there were really a personality clash, if they just disliked each other
                    instinctively, why this would hamper business; but by and large the Bolsheviks
                    are very impersonal in their dealings. Now, let's get back to Mr. Johnson, for
                    goodness sake!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm coming back right here. For example, do you have
                        insight into Mr. Johnson's personal relations with the world leaders?</hi>

                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>BOHLEN: No, I really don't. I have not seen Mr. Johnson very much since I have
                    been back here. It just hasn't come about that way. He does all his dealings
                    with the Department of State, as it is quite proper, through the Secretary of
                    State.</p>
                <p>I think I first met Mr. Johnson when he was a Senator. He was Majority Leader. I
                    can't remember if it was late—whether it was before that in the late '40's, or
                    whether it was in the '50's.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was in the '50's when he was Majority Leader.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: Yes, the '50's when he was Majority Leader; I'm sure that's when I met
                    him. The first time I really was associated with him was in 1961 when President
                    Kennedy called me up and asked me if I would go to Berlin with the Vice
                    President who he was sending over there to the building of the wall. And we
                    rushed over there in a relatively hurried trip. And there I saw him continuously
                    for about 48 hours, maybe a little more. I must say he was a very impressive man
                    when he was on this because he was having to project his personality to the
                    people of Berlin, and it was very well received, what he had to say was well
                    received; and there were some moving moments when a new and additional American
                    contingent was coming into Berlin along the Autobahn Road and he went out to the
                    edge of Berlin to meet them. And it must have been goodness knows how many
                    thousands of people all along the road, hundreds of thousands really, and it was
                    very moving when he met the commanding American officer in there and then we had
                    a dinner at the Mayor's. And the Mayor then was Willy Brandt, who is now Foreign
                    Secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There has been some criticism of Mr. Johnson on his
                        personal relations on trips like that. But you found him effective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: I found him very effective. But of course you didn't have very much
                    chance to do it. We jumped in a plane and flew overnight and got to Berlin and
                    then spent the whole day and night there and took off at 4 a.m. the next morning
                    and came on back here, so you might call it fairly rapid. But I remember the
                    enormous vitality of the man, that he was sitting up reminiscing in the plane
                    with the correspondents who were with us about his Senate days, and he did that
                    steadily from Berlin—about 4 a.m. in the morning—until we got to Shannon in
                    Ireland, which was about three hours.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some critics have dated the difficulties that the United
                        States has had with France during Johnson's Presidency to the meeting that
                        he had with de Gaulle at the Kennedy funeral.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: Oh, no, that had nothing whatsoever to do with it. It was already far
                    advanced. This is a whole other story—the question of why de Gaulle behaves the
                    way he does. I think these are convictions de Gaulle has had, and I think you
                    will find in his early writings, he believed in France as a country that had a
                    special position in the world. And that France—the only way that you could make
                    yourself effective unless you have the physical power which France has not
                    got—is to be totally independent. And I don't think that his meeting with
                    Johnson had anything to do with it at all. In fact, every time I used to see de
                    Gaulle, and I saw quite a lot of him relatively speaking—when I was in France, I
                    used to see him about once every two or three months, as a matter of purpose, I
                    didn't have anything particularly to take up with him, just to have a run around
                    on the situations, and he always used to express admiration for president
                    Johnson; always asked me to transmit to him his highest regard. The
                    misunderstanding that occurred over Kennedy's funeral was one of these things
                    that could happen to anybody, because President Johnson said to de Gaulle that,
                    “I look forward to seeing you on the visit that had been arranged between you
                    and President Kennedy.” And de Gaulle replied, “This is a matter to be
                    arranged.” And de Gaulle really meant that this was a matter to be renegotiated,
                    something like that, and Johnson quite understandably interpreted what he said
                    to mean the details—the date, the place, and all that—and he told that to a
                    group of governors who had come to the funeral, and this got back to the French.
                    And [Herve] Alphand, the Ambassador, rushed around to tell people that it was
                    wrong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But this didn't have any long influence on policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: Heavens no! De Gaulle's attitude had been fixed since God knows when, but
                    he never changed it. He really believed that foreign affairs are sort of like
                    the relationship between planets, big planets have big gravitational pull, and
                    medium size planets had bloody well better stay out of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After Mr. Johnson then became President, was there a
                        notable change which was discernible to you as Ambassador to France in the
                        policy the United States to Europe as compared to Kennedy's policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>BOHLEN: No. Of course Kennedy visited France. I was with him when he went to
                    France in the spring of '61. And he talked to de Gaulle. But by the time the
                    end—just before the assassination—Kennedy had a very clear idea of what the
                    nature of the problem was and how little you could do about it. And he set the
                    tone which President Johnson followed and followed with great skill, I think,
                    which was not to get drawn by de Gaulle, not to get into polemics with him, not
                    to make statements, not to go into this sort of stuff. He expressed it as “too
                    bad,” and this made it possible for me and France to carry on in the same basis,
                    and in other words not stir up more trouble than existed and not let the
                    differences with de Gaulle and with de Gaulle's government really affect the
                    basic element of Franco-American friendship which as far as I can see still
                    remains.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about specific initiatives, such as—well, the big one
                        of the time was the multilateral force?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: Well, I didn't get in on that, and France wasn't involved. You see,
                    because right off France made it plain that they were not going to have any part
                    of it. And it was only later on when they realized that this thing might have
                    gone on, and were terribly concerned about the German involvement in it, that
                    they began to come out against it. By that time, however, the British were
                    against it and all sorts of things were working against it. It seems to me to
                    have been a rather dubious idea in many respects because it seemed to give the
                    United States a veto power over the use of whatever nuclear power any individual
                    European country had, and England was the only one, without giving them any veto
                    power over U.S. use. It seemed very unequal. But it possibly might have worked
                    and we might have solved some of these atomic problems in the Alliance which
                    still remain a problem. We've never found a solution for it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: Yes, oh, yes. Because they were afraid that this was going to turn into
                    an American-German sort of association in the nuclear field.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: Well, it still is, because the really effective thing is the United
                    States. You see, France hasn't got much military power either, one way or
                    another. And France is still in the Alliance, but not in the organization. Of

                        the reaction of Russia to Mr. Johnson's intent, which he has restated over
                        and over again, to increase the detente degree during the time he has been

                <p>BOHLEN: I think they notice this. The Russians—they prefer to have people, sort
                    of working and trying to get along with them, than to have a blast of cold war
                    stuff going on. I think they have perfectly good regard for Mr. Johnson as
                    President of the United States. They naturally have built up Kennedy a little
                    more than they would if he had remained alive as President, but then this is
                    a—you see, the Russians are well aware that the purposes of the United States
                    and what the purposes must be and those of the Soviet Union which stem from the
                    system that is set up in Russia are really not compatible. But there is one

                <p>BOHLEN: Well, they met at Glassboro.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you attend Glassboro?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: No, I was in France.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were still in France then. You don't have any insights
                        then into their personal relationship with Mr. Johnson?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: No, I never observed it. But they respect the Presidency of the United
                    States, because they realize it is a position of great power and enormous
                    influence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I almost hesitate now to go back to Yalta as a frame of
                        reference here. You've cautioned me about it-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: I'm just trying not to do something that isn't in your terms, or in the
                    stated terms—this is for the Johnson papers. But I understand.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'll get to it here in a kind of left-handed way. What you
                        said about Yalta publicly at the time of your appointment as Ambassador to
                        Moscow, that it was not the settlements at Yalta but the Russian violation
                        of them, that caused problems in the post-war world.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: Yalta had nothing to do with sort of freezing the Eastern Europe in
                    Russian hands. This is where the Red Army moved certain places. The agreement at
                    Yalta merely confirmed the zonal agreements, and the only change it made was the
                    allocation of a zone to France and a seat for France on the control council of
                    Germany. This had nothing to do with the division of Europe which is the big
                    question that remains unsolved and will remain unsolved as long as the Soviet
                    Union exists in its present form. This was the imposition on these countries on
                    the Soviet form of government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Mr. Johnson's time as President, there has been a group
                        of scholars sometimes referred to as the New Left or the Revisionists, and
                        there are revisionists for every episode. These people have argued that it
                        was the American overreaction to certain things after 1945 that exacerbated
                        the Cold War. I take it you disagree with that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: This is perfect nonsense. I never read anything—it's just a sign that
                    certain scholars always want to find a new angle, a new slant to anything. This
                    had nothing whatsoever to do with the imposition of the Soviet system in Eastern
                    Europe which was done by the Soviets in various degrees—in Czechoslovakia it was
                    done in 1948; in Hungary it came along a little earlier or later; in Bulgaria,
                    all these things are perfectly clear—Romania was done long before there was any
                    U.S. reaction to anything. This is really, I think, a very strained
                    interpretation of the events.</p>
                <p>The only place that the Russians could have done it and didn't do it was in
                    Finland, and there perfectly clearly they didn't do it because they realized
                    that Finland was just a little bit too tough a nut to crack, that there would be
                    a lot of trouble, that there would be guerrilla warfare. In fact, Stalin said
                    that once in a conversation with Churchill. He said, “You cannot but admire
                    people who would be willing to fight for their country the way the Finns have.”
                    And this has nothing to do with the reaction of the United States towards—There
                    was no NATO at all when Czechoslovakia was taken over by the Communists.</p>
                <p>Well, now, they go as far as to argue that we exaggerated the degree of
                    aggressiveness of Russia after World War II. Is that a tenable argument? Well, I
                    don't know if you could be much more aggressive. Obviously no one thought that
                    the Russians were prepared to go to war. In correspondence between the Central
                    Committee of the Communist party of the Soviet Union and Tito, you'll see a
                    statement that we couldn't use the Red Army to help enforce Communism in France
                    and Italy because it would have meant a war with the United States. This was the
                    statement of the Soviets. And I really haven't read many of these books. I think
                    it would make me too mad.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>Well, they're just beginning to come out and they are obviously written out of
                    the framework of Vietnam, I think. But is apparently going to be a field of
                    scholarship that those of you who went through those years and have expert
                    knowledge are going to have to deal with.</p>
                <p>Don't worry. As soon as I get out of the government I'll be very active in
                    encountering these theories because they are just plain untrue. I went through
                    this whole period there, the very beginning of it, the first meeting with the
                    Russians, continuous all the way through, and I saw a series of American
                    attempts to really find some Basis with the Soviet Union and that every time we
                    were thrown for a loss because the system is impenetrable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. How would you estimate, out of your long
                        experience, Mr. Johnson as a foreign policy leader?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: Here you get into a very different thing; there's no doubt about it but
                    that the Vietnamese thing—he inherited it, he did not start it, he inherited it,
                    it came all the way down from Eisenhower through Kennedy. And the beginning in
                    the increase of troops, it was done under President Kennedy, and so I don't
                    think in any way you can blame—if I can use that term—Johnson for the initiation
                    of the Vietnamese War. It had just turned into active U.S. participation there.
                    My personal opinion is, and I haven't been in the whole act so perhaps I'm not
                    qualified to talk about it, is that we took on something that was a little more
                    than we could really handle correctly, simply because of the limitations imposed
                    on our actions by our own civilization and our own thoughts and the nature of
                    guerrilla warfare is something that we were not particularly trained or equipped
                    to handle. And I think you can't tell—you will have to wait until the whole
                    thing is over to make any judgment on it, before you could whether it was—
                    Certainly you have—the reality of the impulse that put us in there was a
                    perfectly sound one. It didn't have any overtones of imperialism or desire to
                    acquire military positions or anything like that. It was simply to defend the
                    right of a small, weak, ineffective in a sense, government, to really get the
                    people to choose their own fate for them and not have it imposed on them by
                    armed action from without.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why do you think it has been so difficult to explain this,
                        not just to the general public but to a substantial portion of the informed
                        political community?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>BOHLEN: Well, I think one of the reasons is that the United States had really a
                    very short time to develop a national consciousness as to what world involvement
                    meant. What are the prices that you pay for being in the world? We'd had a
                    hundred seventy years or so of isolationism where we could stand back and take
                    extreme positions criticizing others without being in the game. When you are in
                    the game, it requires a certain understanding of the fact that you are not going
                    to win every bout, that you are not going to have 100-percent total success
                    every time you turn around. Sometimes it is going to be bloody and long and
                    onerous, as it is in Vietnam. Also, the fact that this is impossible to relate
                    to the security of the United States. You see, we are a great big country, they
                    are a little country and whatever it is, how many thousands of miles away— 8,000
                    miles away from us—and it is very, very complicated—it requires a certain amount
                    of sophisticated understanding of what a Communist system does. This domino
                    theory which is very much discredited now is not really very untrue at all.
                    Engels once said that the trouble with a military frontier is one 100 kilometers
                    farther out is preferable, and this is the same thing for us as for the
                    Communists. When you get a Communist thing here or there, this is the frontier
                    of the clash with the non-Communist world; and if you move it out each step it
                    goes farther.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think the analogies between Asian aggression then
                        hold to European aggression that occurred in the time that you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: Well, I don't think you can make quite the analogy with Hitler that you
                    make with the Communists because it was a different proposition entirely.
                    Certainly in all these weak, sort of shaky countries in Eastern Asia, if we had
                    not really done what we did in Vietnam I don't know what would have happened.
                    It's very difficult for me to see that Indonesia would be turned against the
                    Communists the way they did. And in all of them I think the tide would be
                    running that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you think, if there is one that you can pick out,
                        has been Mr. Johnson's chief weakness as a foreign policy leader?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>BOHLEN: I don't really know what his chief weakness is. I think it is perhaps his
                    apparently rather strong desire for secrecy. It has been detrimental to him in
                    his dealings with the press and the public, the fact that he has created the
                    impression of being a sort of a contriver, a wheeler-dealer, stuff like that. I
                    don't know whether I can judge him from just what you hear and read in the
                    press, and stuff like that. This so-called credibility gap is largely a lot of
                    nonsense but on the other hand, the very fact that you can use this is one of
                    the impressions. But I don't think he has ever had any sort of unworthy
                    ambitions or unworthy aims at all. I think that he has done more than any
                    President in the field of race relationships and domestic things. I think it's
                    only tragic that this damned Vietnamese thing took so much of his time and
                    energy and so much money and all this sort of stuff as to really take it away
                    from what I know he would want to do which would really be to deal with the
                    domestic problems in the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think it is possible within the system we have to
                        educate public opinion? You mentioned a couple of times the shortness of
                        time to get used to our responsibilities, and so on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: I don't know. I think it is going to take a very long time and everything
                    goes so much quicker now. Of course, it ought to be quicker. But the point is
                    that most countries that rose to an eminent position in the world had
                    generations, even centuries, to become accustomed to it—like Great Britain, for
                    example. But we really had this dumped on us since 1947, is when it happened,
                    when the British revealed that they did not have the strength left to play the
                    role, and they asked and we had to pick it up. And this decision was made at the
                    time of the Greek-Turkish thing. But that was not a provocative decision on our
                    part?</p>
                <p>I don't think so at all. It was a question of saving Greece and saving Turkey.
                    The Russians obviously—at that time they had an open claim to two provinces of
                    Turkey and there was a civil war going on in Greece.</p>
                <p>I don't know what these revisionists would have us do. One thing that they ought
                    to remember is that there has never been a recorded case where the majority of
                    the people ever voted the Communist regime in power.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOHLEN: And also that Communism is a room with no exit. None have ever been able
                    to overcome it. Well, I think we've covered enough ground.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to say, is there anything you'd like to add,
                        just in the way of an open-ended—?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>BOHLEN: No, the only thing I can say is that I have not had the pleasure of
                    seeing Mr. Johnson very much since he has been President, but I do know from
                    people that have dealt with him, like Rusk particularly, whom I know very well
                    indeed, have unbounded admiration for his courage and his steadfastness and
                    purpose, and this sort of stuff.</p>
                <p>Every President has his own characteristics, and I think one of the difficulties
                    of President Johnson was to come after such a President as John F. Kennedy to
                    whom I was personally devoted. And he brought a whole new breath of change, a
                    different thing. He was young, he was attractive, and it was very difficult for
                    the President who comes after him, particularly in the sort of deification that
                    occurred after his assassination. Sir, I think you very much for your patience.
                    I appreciate it. Thank you.</p>
