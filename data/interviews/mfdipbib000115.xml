                <p>Interviewed by: Jewell Fenzi</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: November 12, 1992</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Jewell Fenzi on Thursday, November 12, 1992. I am
                        interviewing Ruth Clement Bond at her home in Washington, DC.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>I was struck immediately, when I saw your husband's biographic information in an
                    old [Department of State Biographic] Register, by the fact that when you first
                    went overseas, to Haiti, you taught English; then in Liberia you taught at the
                    university. Suddenly there was a transition; when you went to Kabul you were a
                    “housewife.” What accounts for this difference?</p>
                <p>BOND: At the first post, Haiti, my husband was director of the education program
                    in a team of six or seven people, two of whom were women, sent out for the U.S.
                    Government's Good Neighbor Policy in Latin America, which Nelson Rockefeller
                    headed up. They taught languages, science, homemaking in some of the schools. My
                    husband was called chief of party. Although I wasn't one of the team, I taught
                    English, in the �cole normal, and also started working on my doctorate there,
                    but after I had a baby I gave up that effort.</p>
                <p>I began teaching English when my husband wanted to send one young man, an English
                    teacher, to the United States to study. Max got a scholarship for him, but he
                    said, “Dr. Bond, I can't take it because I can't support my family on that,
                    because I will have to give up this job.” So Max asked me, “Ruth, how would you
                    like to teach English at the �cole normal?” And I said, “Why not.” So the
                    government paid him the salary and I did the work. He could go to America and
                    have the two salaries coming in, the two sources.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>I was head of the English Department at Kentucky State College when we got
                    married in 1931. My field was English and I had gotten my degree at
                    Northwestern. My new husband got a scholarship to the University of Southern
                    California, so I went West with him and started on my doctorate there.
                    Unfortunately... I started to say “unfortunately I became pregnant.” That's not
                    what I mean, but it was unfortunate for me because I was really enjoying my
                    studies so much. I had to make a decision. I went to school as long as I could,
                    and then I took time out to have the baby. Started back to school and left my
                    baby with a woman who lived in one of those little [southern California]
                    cottages, we lived in a cottage too. It was just a nice little neighborhood, a
                    semicircle of houses with English, Korean and black American families, and of
                    course we were black American too. A black American woman who lived in back of
                    us, off the street, said, “Well, Mrs. Bond, I'll keep your baby for you.”</p>
                <p>So I said, “All right.” I thought I had a solution. But about two days after I
                    had started back to school I had to come home unexpectedly for something. I had
                    my hours when I would come back regularly. I would leave the baby clothes, and a
                    bottle with her, she knew when I was coming back. And then I came back
                    unexpectedly. My baby was on her dirty kitchen floor, filthy, sucking on a piece
                    of bacon and had an asafoetidic bag [a bitter resin with an obnoxious odor,
                    thought to ward off disease] around her neck. So I began to think: which is more
                    important to me, the health of my child or getting a PhD. I was making straight
                    “A”s, I must say. I had even talked over with my advisor what my topic was going
                    to be. I decided at that time that maybe I had better stay home with my baby. So
                    I just gave up on my PhD, and thought I would do it later.</p>
                <p>When my husband was called back to head a mission the Government was sending to
                    the Tennessee Valley Authority, I found there was no college down there that I
                    could attend to continue working on the PhD, so instead I set about organizing
                    the women whose husbands were working on the TVA dam and who, for really the
                    first time, were getting a lot of cash. Some of the workers had been
                    sharecroppers. The Government built four houses for men who would move in with
                    their families; the rest of the workers lived in big dormitories in a compound.
                    We lived in one of the cottages that had been built as an experiment for people
                    living there — because my husband thought that living outside the town provided
                    me a chance to work with the women and show them what opportunities existed —
                    they were buying pianos with cash, and they couldn't get them into their
                    cottages! These country women were buying things they didn't need, yet weren't
                    fixing up their houses.</p>
                <p>I decided to start a program called “home beautification.” We got donations from
                    the cook in the dormitories, such as sacks he didn't need, which we dyed. We'd
                    have one TVA room in each cottage and the women made curtains for it, wove some
                    beautiful rugs, made new quilt patterns — our first quilt we called “Black
                    Power.” That was a pun, of course, TVA being about power, distinguished from
                    black power of the 1960s. The first interns in the Authority came from many of
                    the black colleges like Fisk and Tennessee State. My husband decided to open
                    what he called a training and work program for them during the summer.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>The women made a copy of the Black Power quilt for me, from the patterns I'd
                    designed and with colors I'd chosen. It was stolen later, in storage with our
                    effects in Atlanta. Someone told me that her husband might have given the first
                    “Black Power” quilt to the TVA chief, Mr. David Lilienthal, though his son
                    professed not to know about it. Now, I understand, the Smithsonian is taking the
                    old quilt patterns, reproducing them for manufacture in China and sale in the
                    U.S., which would probably diminish the value of U.S. handmade quilts. Some of
                    us are protesting that these patterns are given to cheap labor in order to make
                    quilts to sell at cheap prices.</p>
                <p>The first quilt showed a bolt of lightning signifying power, held in the hand of
                    a black worke[they locate a picture of the figure] instead of the banjo that he
                    would normally hold. I gave the quilters the material cutouts and selected the
                    colors. You can see the bolt of lightning he's holding in his right hand. [Fenzi
                    asks to borrow the picture to make photocopy]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is fascinating. If you originated the term “black
                        power”!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOND: Some people say this. The student interns down there working on the dam
                    with us who were from the universities were in the first intern program the
                    Government had. Here's a write up that tells how the interns interpreted it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thank you, and I'll copy the article about you, and the
                        pictures.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOND: I'm still trying to find where that first quilt is. I hadn't thought about
                    the Smithsonian, possibly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was each of the quilts making a political statement, or a
                        woman's statement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOND: Well, in a way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a theme to that do you remember?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOND: The only thing I was trying to say was that things were opening up for the
                    blacks in the SoutThis was in the early 1930s — I had only one child, born in
                    California in 1933 when we down to TVA. My other son, J. Max Bond, Jr. was born
                    in Louisville, Kentucky after we were moved to Knoxville to TVA headquarters.
                    [Her second son, George Clement Bond was born in Knoxville, Tennessee.] When we
                    went from California to TVA, my baby (she laughs) kept me from getting my
                    PhD.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, where did these very simple sharecropper women learn
                        to do such marvelous quilting? From their parents?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOND: You see, that's what the old black slaves used to do. And they told their
                    stories in their quilts, you see. Oh, the quilts had names, you know, the kind
                    that they made. I used to be able to call all that up. The one thing I could do
                    was always to tie my husband in with the names he couldn't think of. Since he
                    died there's a block there now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because you've taken on all the things that he used to do
                        and your mind is occupied.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOND: I guess that's it. At any rate, we really beautified the people's homes.
                    Everybody contracted to the TVA Authority had to have a “TVA room,” we decided.
                    If they didn't live in the compound, the husbands had to see that the steps were
                    fixed up; we just fixed up the houses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the TVA room had to have — what?Drapes made from the
                        feed sacks?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOND: They didn't have to have it but they didn't have any other way, so it meant
                    most of them did have that — you know, like napkins. We approached the cook at
                    the commissary, who had lots of sacks for flour and whatnot, and we bleached
                    them and dyed them. The women were very skillful and knew how to quilt,
                    beautifully because that's what they did. Their mothers had made quilts for the
                    “big house”, so they did a skillful job; I never learned to quilt but I made and
                    cut the patterns and made the designs for them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Those quilts stayed in their homes, most of the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOND: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the few surviving ones of course at this point must be
                        very valuable?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOND: They must be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they should be.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>BOND: I'm going to get off this quilt business. Merikay, when she was looking for
                    the quilt, called me and said, “You know, a woman whose grandmother lived on the
                    TVA has a quilt that she says that her grandmother designed, and it's one of
                    your quilts.” She had it on exhibit — it wasn't the 'Power' one, it was another
                    one — in Kentucky, I think it was. She went down to see it, and she said “this
                    old woman designed the quilt.”The old woman hadn't designed the quilt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She maybe had made it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOND: She made the quilt, yes, but she used my patterns, my design. Maybe she had
                    a copy of a quilt that was made from the same paper pattern that I had — I made
                    the patterns and just left them there and I helped the women cut their patterns.
                    Then they took the quilts, and then when they made another quilt, maybe the
                    design wouldn't be as true — you know what I mean. I don't think one of these
                    designs is as nice as my design, it's basically the same design.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you studied art at all? Or quilting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOND: No but I've always been very artistic. I can show you things up there that
                    I did. That little figure on the end of the mantel here I did. I'll tell you how
                    I got into that — in Haiti.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, the primitive arts there, yes!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOND: Well, the [U.S.] Government employed Glenn Lucan from California, a famous
                    potter. He couldn't speak French. Now, this is our first foreign assignment, but
                    he was a wonderful potter, and he was teaching the Haitians to make fancier
                    things than they were making. So he asked me, “When I go out, will you go with
                    me and translate?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this to create a cottage industry?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOND: Yes. While I was going around with him, he said, “Mrs. Bond, why don't you
                    just learn to pot too?” I made the little batch up there and some of those along
                    there — I just found I could, just pot. I made mine with coils, I didn't use the
                    wheels that they had, I did it all sculpting by hand.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>The Ambassador's wife at that time, Mrs. Orme Wilson, was from a famous Eastern
                    family. When she found I was working with Haitians, “Let's make some garments
                    for them, let's take them some things that they can use.” She'd pick me up in
                    her car. I'd always wait for her to get in, then she'd say, “Get in, get in!”
                    And we'd go and distribute the things that we were going to give to the poor. My
                    biggest contribution was to teach. I tutored some of the women who wanted to
                    learn English. They'd come to my house. One of these women had a daughter who
                    was wife of the Minister of Education. Everything I did there was volunteer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then you went off to Liberia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOND: Yes. The governor of Liberia, President [William] Tubman, asked our
                    government, since they wanted a university, to send someone out to help them
                    establish a university. President Tubman asked Max to go and talk with him and
                    see what could be done.I went with him. The President said he wanted a
                    university. They had high schools run by missionaries, and one missionary group
                    had a college way up-country from Monrovia but the President wanted a university
                    in Monrovia.</p>
                <p>He appointed Max as president, so he became the first college president but he
                    was paid by the American government. Well, the students wanted to strike against
                    the government. Max wasn't doing anything about it because he didn't feel —
                    Tubman said, “You know one thing? I'm going to take you off your government's
                    payroll and put you on my payroll, so that when I say that we're going to
                    strike, we'll strike.” (she laughs) It wasn't as blunt as that. He told Max to
                    encourage the students to strike. Max said, “I can't encourage them to strike.
                    I'm paid by the United States Government, I can't be out here making people
                    strike.”</p>
                <p>We had a wonderful foreign tour. At any rate, after Max became paid by Liberia,
                    the students did strike once, for things Max felt they should have. You see,
                    they couldn't buy any food on campus. They'd come into town, walk out to the
                    campus, and there was no housing for them, and no food except what they brought.
                    So Max had the school buy a bus, which would go into town every morning to the
                    place where our government had their aid-to-Liberia projec[they try to give it a
                    name, Bond can't recall it but remembers that doctors and teachers were sent;

                </p>
                <p>BOND: My mother was the first black woman chosen as “Mother of America,” when we
                    were in Haiti. Max was giving a party for a visiting Nelson Rockefeller at our
                    house and a Haitian came in and said, in French, not knowing how good my French
                    was, “Oh, they say a black woman is 'Mother of America' now.” One fellow who
                    didn't really know anything about it said, “Yes, some scrub woman out of New
                    York.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I hope you set him straight?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOND: I was amazed. No, I didn't have to set him straight. Another black American
                    couple there, one of my friends said, “What do you mean?” And she really gave
                    him “what for”, because my father was a bishop and my mother — we lived in a
                    20-room house then; because there was such deep segregation in the South at that
                    time. When public conferences would come, or when carloads of preachers who were
                    under impoverished dioceses would come down, there was no place for them to stay
                    unless you kept them.</p>
                <p>We were living in Louisville. I was born there, then we moved to Charlotte, North
                    Carolina, where Papa was editor of the church paper. We moved back to Louisville
                    when I was still a child. Mr. Ohrbacher, a millionaire there, who had a big
                    mansion in midtown, intended to move to Florida. I don't know how he met Papa
                    but when there were big gatherings in the city and blacks and whites were
                    together, this man said, “Bishop Clement, you need a big house.” Papa had
                    already selected a smaller house in a black community. The man said, “You're
                    going to have to entertain people when they come through here and we get
                    together.” So he sold Papa the house, at a minimal price, $21,000, and we lived
                    in that. My father said he would have to keep every carload of blacks who came
                    through the city! (laughter)</p>
                <p>All seven of us went to college. My mother was from Providence, Rhode Island. She
                    was a daring sort of person. She had been reared in the north and she had no
                    fear of anybody. In Charlotte, the short time we lived there, they had street
                    cars. Mamma would take me by the hand when we got ready to get on a street car,
                    and we would get right on. Mamma never would hold back like the other black
                    women did to let the white people get on first. Mamma never did that. So we
                    children had a different feeling. I thought white people were just people. Some
                    people were sort of afraid of Mamma, just as some blacks were afraid of white
                    people. But we never were.</p>

                <p>Everybody in my family was an achiever, in the sense that they gave freely of
                    whatever we had to give. There was a great sense of community service right in
                    the family. You couldn't get out of doing community things, and everyone of us —
                    I had six brothers and sisters — kept that sense of community spirit. I loved to
                    read and didn't always want to give up my books for a meeting. Sometimes I would
                    hide in the downstairs lavatory if I knew I had to go to Girl Reserves, or the
                    YWCA or something like that. Papa would ask, “Where's Ruth?” and then he would
                    come and knock on the door.</p>
                <p>So I always had that sense of community service wherever we went.</p>

                <p>BOND:I think I was the only American who was, at that time, 1955, invited into an
                    Afghan home. My very good friend whose husband worked under our ambassador in
                    Afghanistan, said she never got into a home. [They discuss her taking charge of
                    the commissary, about which the Ambassador wrote her, “This is the most

                        of the women I interviewed told me — I believe it was her landlord — would
                        say, “Meet us up on the roof” and his wife would come up on the roof and
                        they'd talk back and forth like that. I don't think she was invited ...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>BOND: They told me I was the first American woman that had ever been invited. A
                    first cousin of the king had married another cousin of the king and had studied
                    in America and had taken his wife with him. When he came back, she had to go
                    back behind the veil. One day he said to me, “You know my wife, she's got to
                    meet an American woman. Would you like to meet my wife?”I said, “Of course I
                    would.”</p>
                <p>So he invited not only me to his house but also my husband — they were very good
                    friends. Later they had to flee to Iran. Ambassador to Afghanistan was Angus
                    Ward, who Mrs. Bond describes as “different.” His foreign born wife was
                    difficult. “You didn't take a step toward her until she took a step toward
                    you.]”</p>

                        the time my husband and I went to Tunis, in 1967, we found the women really

                </p>
                <p>BOND: I organized a group to sew for the Tunisian children. They used to meet in
                    my house and we would make garments. One other thing I did, which I wouldn't be
                    telling to everybody:we found out that along the border between Tunisia and
                    Algeria, were a lot of refugees who had crossed into Tunisia and needed
                    food.</p>
                <p>Our government was sending food up there to them. Someone came back and said our
                    food was making them sick. We were sending them canned stuff, but they would put
                    their brackish water in the food and cook it, also in the milk — we were sending
                    them lots of it because there were babies up there.</p>
                <p>The Ambassador's wife wasn't interested in doing anything for the Tunisians. So
                    we organized some five carloads of women to go to the border and took canned
                    milk, clothes — little jackets and things like that to these Algerian refugees,
                    and showed them how to use the Sterno stoves, and told them if they opened a can
                    of beans, say, not to put any water to it.</p>

                    didn't speak out to the people in the country [Haiti], he wrote papers against
                    [U.S. actions]. When we left Haiti, all the people thought that Max was coming

                    down and washed the crops out, and that we were doing an injustice to the people

                    speak out [End of tape 1]</p>
                <p>When we arrived in Afghanistan, the first thing the ambassador asked Max was “Oh
                    Dr. Bond. Why are you here? What did you do wrong.” Well, what had he
                    [Ambassador Angus Ward] done? Maybe he had spoken out too much. I don't know
                    what he had done. The Indian ambassador's wife and I became good friends. We
                    were the only two foreign women that the Afghans would let work with their
                    women. One of the prominent ministers let the two of us work with the Afghan
                    women to teach poor women how to use patterns — my sister and some of my friends
                    would mail me patterns. Some of the American women said to me, “We don't
                    understand why they let you [work with them] and won't let us come in.”Some
                    [high up American women] must have protested, because when I went to the
                    building one day I was told, “We can't have any foreigners.” Now, this was just
                    for women! It was a big building for women where they taught them to sew, to
                    cook and how to use patterns — I had my sisters sending out patterns, and the
                    Indian ambassador's wife and I were helping them to sew. I had to stop going
                    because they wouldn't let us work with the women. But anyway I still had some
                    friends. Some of the Afghans who were very high up would invite me to affairs
                    they gave for women. But most of the time I would be the only American women
                    there. The French women would be there, the Catholic women would come and some
                    of the others from different countries. We weren't being limited to these things
                    though. They would give something, say, for Dr. Bond and his wife. The Frenchman
                    would bring his wife, and the German would bring his wife, and the Englishman
                    would bring his wife, and Max would bring me. I must say I was a privileged
                    person in that country. Privileged in the sense that the women would let me into
                    their homes.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BOND: I know I was the only American woman but I didn't ask any of the other
                    [third country] women if they ever got into an Afghan home; I don't know what
                    they did, the German woman... I'm going to stop talking. I'm not going to tell

                </p>
                <p>BOND: I started off as vice president under somebody else other than Naomi. [She
                    can't recall; then to reassure her, JF says Bond can edit tape later. Bond feels
                    that she has talked more freely than she ordinarily would, wouldn't say these
                    things to anybody who might use them. Bond has revealed private things.]</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What I would like to use in the book we're writing is your
                        family background, your sense of community service and how you took that
                        with you everywhere. I think I would like to mention that you were the only
                        American woman during your stay in Kabul who was admitted into the Afghan
                        home, which certainly won't offend anyone.. [emphasizes she avoids using
                        negatives, emphasizes substantive things FS women do. Notes that although
                        they have been talking for almost two hours, Bond has never mentioned giving
                        a dinner party, which is public perception of Foreign Service.] I haven't
                        asked you about Blantyre [Malawi] but I imagine you did the same thing there
                        as everywhere else. What else did you do as AAFSW vice president?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOND: Polly Jones, the ambassador's wife in Tunis, knew I'd worked with Tunisian
                    women and had organized things. And June Byrne [Spencer] and I had always been
                    good friends in Tunis, and I missed her so much. They left Tunis before we did.
                    When we returned home, Polly was president of AAFSW. Polly said to me, “Ruth, so
                    many of our women come back who aren't Washingtonians, they don't know anybody
                    here and yet they want to help in the community, want something to do — find a
                    place where they'll feel comfortable yet do something helpful.”</p>
                <p>I told that to a friend here and she said, “I'll tell you a place that really
                    needs — the boys club in Southeast, that used to be an all-white boys club but
                    is now all black. I'll introduce you to the fellow who's director there.”He
                    said, “We'll be glad to have you.” So then he set out to find people, local
                    people, who wanted to join the Foreign Service women who wanted to work. He
                    said, “There's a woman who's head of the Mother's Club who comes and cooks for
                    them, ask her. Another woman who keeps a place for homeless women who're paid
                    for, she's doing a fine job, I think she'd ought to be in here too. She has
                    plenty of ideas.”</p>
                <p>I knew a fellow who'd been at the London School of Economics with my son, who
                    introduced me to his mother, who then said she had known me a long time. She
                    said, “Well, Ruth, I'll come and work with you and I'll bring some women with
                    me.” So she brought Laura Carson, who had been a principal. She brought top
                    grade black women into that group there, along with white women too. I'm only
                    using black and white so you will get the complex of it.</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, who else can we get?” A man who was on the board of the boys club
                    up here in the city said, “I'm black, I can get you a person, I think Helen
                    Smith would come.” Another woman, a white woman, said, “I'd like to work with
                    you, I do real estate but I'm not doing that all the time, I'd like work.” And
                    so the nucleus of that came out of Polly Jones suggesting that we form something
                    up there where people could come, and we could offer them anything they wanted —
                    how to painSo we got a nucleus of people at all levels, and a wonderful mix of
                    women who came — some poor, some rich, some black, some white; all of them nice.
                    We worked together and we're still working together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is this the group that Lesley Dorman — a boys and girls
                        club?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>BOND: Yes. It's called Eastern Branch. Lesley came into the group when she heard
                    what we were doing. June Byrne Spencer also came. Polly spread the word and some
                    other Foreign Service women came. Some had butterfly collections. Another fellow
                    taught wood carving. We had a lot of books donated to the library. I was the
                    catalyst, and some of the finest women we had were those who came in in the
                    beginning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You also helped with the AAFSW Bookfair?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOND: Oh yes. Each year that we've been here, I've helped with that. I think I
                    was second vice president, first vice president, never became president.
                    Somebody raised the question that Max wasn't working for the State Department
                    anymore.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That explains it — you do have to be an active Foreign
                        Service wife to be president.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOND: I'm glad to know thaNaomi and I worked together very well. I represented
                    Foreign Service women in New York.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember any discussions about the '72 Directive at
                        AAFSW meetings when you were there?That was the Directive that made us
                        independent, you could take a job if you could find one, you had no
                        responsibility to the mission at all. Of course, that didn't really affect
                        you, you were retired when that came out. That was all happening during
                        Naomi's incumbency.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOND: Yes, it was, I remember that, but it didn't affect me personally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have one more question. Did you have any close influence
                        over your famous nephew Julian?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOND: No, I didn't know Julian very well. They lived in Atlanta. My children were
                    already in college when we were traveling. Julian's father Horace taught in the
                    university of which my brother was president. We never lived in the same city
                    and Horace's children were younger than my children.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is your father in “Who's Who,” or your husband, or
                        both?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>BOND: Both. But maybe not in the edition on the [library] shelf. And my mother
                    too. And my sister is listed in “Who's Who.” I'm listed in “Who's Who of Women
                    in America,” and my other sister is listed there too. My father was Bishop
                    George C. Clement. And my brother was Dr. RufuClement. My mother's name was Emma
                    Clarissa Williams Clement.</p>
                <p>My husband's father, a Congregational minister was a prominent American too. He
                    was head of an organization in Kentucky, I can't recall its name. Our house was
                    large so interracial groups could meet in Louisville. They'd hold their
                    receptions in Papa's house, I told you how the diocese paid a fortune for it
                    [even though the house was bought at a nominal price], which is known as the
                    Ohrbacher Mansion. It had halls that were wide enough to dance in. The first
                    floor had seven rooms and one was a bedroom. Papa had a study and he had a den,
                    all that sort of thing. Ordinarily the church would never have bought a house
                    like that — at that time the church wasn't buying the bishops houses — but Papa
                    needed it because of segregation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to the house, is it still there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOND: It was there the last time I went.(showing a picture of it)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, isn't that grand!What fun to play in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOND: The stairway was so wide, it went circular up. It broke at the first
                    landing and there was a big mirror and you could see yourself coming down after
                    you dressed and could see how you looked. The Ohrbachers sold it for a nominal
                    amount. So we lived there, and everybody who came to Louisville who wanted to
                    stay there could stay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But your mother probably had help</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOND: Oh yes, we always had help.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it wasn't as though she was trying to do it alone. That
                        makes a big difference.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOND: Of course it does.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is a wonderful place. What fun to grow up there.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>BOND: It was lots of fun. You could slide down the bannisters, and when you got
                    where you had to turn, then you turned and [slid on] — I used to always take the
                    steps two at a time. They were broad, with low risers. I have sturdy legs for my
                    age!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure that has something to do with it, and the fact
                        that you lived — my husband and I say “we live vertically” because we have a
                        town house and we're up and down stairs all day long.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOND: It's good for you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your mother was a good friend of Marian Anderson. Your
                        mother was a pianist?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOND: She would give concerts in church. Even Marian Anderson had to give
                    concerts in churches because there was no place where a black person could
                    sing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I saw that in her documentary on PBS television.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOND: Later, when my brother became president of Atlanta University, she'd come
                    to Atlanta to give [a] concert. Even when she could have gone somewhere else she
                    always stayed with my brother. As a girl long ago she had said — I guess she's
                    forgotten it — “I was always pleased to be on a program with your mother.” My
                    mother had a beautiful voice. She had seven children. I got my name Ruth because
                    she had the lead in a play called “Ruth the Gleaner.” She was pregnant with me
                    at the time, so when I was born they named me Ruth. Well, my father said they
                    named me that after his sister Ruth, and my mother said they named me after Ruth
                    the gleaner. I was very fortunate in having good, well-educated, participative,
                    well-spoken mother and father, who didn't allow us to mistreat anybody either,
                    even one another. Nor did they allow us to speak broken English. And we always
                    had to come down for a meal. Whoever was there when dinner was being served had
                    to come and sit at the table. There were seven of us, and Mother and Father at
                    table, and sometimes the person who was helping us, making ten. One girl, they
                    sent through college. If the person wanted to go to college and was young, then
                    they'd send her away to college.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you got older she was more like a mother's helper.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOND: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your mother would go across town...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>BOND: Instead of going to church with us, she would go across town and play as
                    organist or soloist. She wouldn't go in the surrey, which had two seats, I
                    always would ride in the surrey, but Mother went in the buggy. We had two
                    horses. I always considered it a privilege if Mama would pick me out to drive
                    with her in the buggy across town to where she was going to play. I was just the
                    age when I would sit well, not like my younger sister who might squirm on the
                    seat and fall out or something. So I would drive my mother to church, but I had
                    to come back home for Sunday school, which all of us attended together.</p>
                <p>I had a fascinating life because my parents did so many nice things for us. They
                    were respected, and they respected everybody in the community. They spoke to
                    everybody in the community. Which doesn't sound like anything, but you know in
                    some communities, everybody doesn't speak to everybody.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BOND: And as I told you, she was the first black woman to be chosen Mother of
                    America. We grew up to respect the rights of others and to do what we could —
                    not in any superior way but as comrades with everybody with whom we came in
                    contact. That has always been our credo. There were many others, I'm not saying
                    we were the only family like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But actually, being a minister's ambitious wife
                        especially, is a little bit like being a Foreign Service wife — you are on

                </p>
                <p>BOND: Exactly.</p>

                        perhaps have more rigorous standards than other people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOND: Yes, be more susceptible to what's happening around you. Anyway, when we
                    would all be at the dinner or breakfast table, if somebody made a grammatical
                    error, they would have to get up from the table and open a window up. You were
                    careful of your speech, not only because you were well-spoken but you didn't
                    adopt the language of the street, as many children do who come from families
                    that speak beautiful English.</p>
                <p>On Sunday mornings my mother played the piano at breakfast and we all sang. Then
                    on special occasions if we weren't too rushed we went around the table — at that
                    time there would be nine of us — we'd have to say a little Bible verse. We'd try
                    to have little new verses to say. And Papa read poetry to us and we would try to
                    solve puzzles. It was fun to see if we could solve them — like a man was on one
                    side of a river and he had a fox and a goose...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And he had a bag of feed, and how did he get them all
                        across.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOND: That's it. Papa was demanding about things, such as spelling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Demanding, but in a very nice warm, supportive, positive
                        way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOND: Yes. When I was little, Papa's office was nearer to school than our house
                    was and I used to do what Mama didn't like — instead of coming home with the
                    children, I'd slip off and go to Papa's office and wait till he was ready to
                    come home. I was very fond of both of them but my mother was a different
                    temperament. I'm glad she was. I'm glad she made you pick up your room, and made
                    you speak to people — I mean, she really kept us in line.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, of course she thought that was her motherly duty and
                        I guess it was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOND: I was one of three little ones. My sister was younger than I but my two
                    brothers just younger than I were a year apart and I was a year apart, so we
                    were very close together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were those two brothers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOND: George and James. James became a minister, he studied theology a[can't
                    recall name]. My brother George was more a young fellow of the world. [End of

                <p>It is important to point out in this transcript that even though I was all over
                    the world with my husband, I managed to raise three children who have done very
                    well in life. My oldest child, Jane Clement Bond, has a PhD in French History
                    from London University and is now a professor of History at Baruch College, City
                    University of New York. My second child, J. Max Bond, Jr., received his post
                    graduate architectural degree from Harvard University. Since then, he has had a
                    distinguished career as an architect. He has been chairman of the department of
                    architecture at Columbia University, and is currently a full partner in the
                    prestigious architectural New York firm of Davis, Brody and Associates. My third
                    child, George Clement Bond, received his PhD in anthropology from the London
                    School of Economics. Currently, he is the Director of the African Institute of
                    Columbia University and he is a full professor at Columbia Teachers College.</p>
