                <p>Q: Today is November 29, 1999. This is an interview with William M. Woessner.
                    This is being done on behalf of The Association for Diplomatic Studies and
                    Training and I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy. You go by Bill?</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's start at the beginning. Could you tell me when and
                        wheryou were born and something about your family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: On May 14, 1931 in College Point, Queens County, part of New York City.
                    My dad was a New York City fireman. He had lost his father when he was a boy,
                    went into an orphanage, came out at 14, and went to work on a railroad to
                    support his mother and siblings. He and my mother married in 1929. I have a
                    younger brother.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is your mother's background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: She was a housewife. She worked for R.G. Dunn and Company when she came
                    out of high school. She also had to go to work young. But she enjoyed R.G. Dunn
                    and Company and made some money on the stock market and then lost it all in
                    1929.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, she got married.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Yes. She and Dad had known one another from the time hwas in the
                    orphanage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you living in College Point?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: Yes, I was born there and grew up there until I left to go to Europe on
                    a Fulbright and on to Northwestern University, the Army, and then the Foreign
                    Service. I never came back after that. But the family lived there until very
                    recently when we had to move my mother down here.</p>
                <p>Q: I think it's so interesting to look at where our Foreign Service people come
                    from, particularly people of your generation. So few were to the manner born.
                    Did your father have any high school?</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: No. He finished elementary school education in the orphanage and then
                    was released at the age of 14. He was always very conscious of the fact that he
                    had not had more formal education. Those were rough years. His mother took in
                    washing, one of those classic stories. He had two sisters and a brother. The
                    brother went into the orphanage with him. The girls stayed with their mother.
                    Then as a New York City fireman, again and again he took the exam to become an
                    officer, but he never had the academic background to make it. I think he was
                    conscious of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: College Point. During the time you were growing up, what
                        was ilike?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Although it was part of New York City, it was very much a community
                    apart. Physically, it was separated from the rest of Queens. To get out there,
                    you had to take a causeway through marshland. It was located close to what
                    became the Queens end of the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge. Largely Germans originally
                    settled it in the mid-19th century, Hungarians from the Austro-Hungarian Empire,
                    a certain number of Irish. A man named Conrad Poppenhusen founded an institute
                    that was the first free adult education school in the United States. There was a
                    hard rubber factory there. Its heyday was in the 1920s with lots of Biergartens
                    along the shore. People would come over from Manhattan. It was a happy
                    community, lots of trees. We really had a very enjoyable childhood.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you get any feel for local politics? I would imagine that, with your
                    father being in the fire department, you couldn't help but avoid politics.</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: I think in those days if you had a position in the police or the fire
                    department, you had to register as a Democrat, but other than that, neither of
                    my parents was ever politically active.</p>
                <p>Q: What about at home? By the time you were getting aware of things, it was still
                    the depths of the Depression. Was this a subject of concern? Having a job with
                    the fire department was considered a good deal, wasn't it?</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: I remember Mother often saying how fortunate we were that my father had
                    this job. He went to the fire department about the time they got married. I can
                    remember as a boy homeless people coming under the window looking for food. That
                    seems so incredible today, but it's true. We didn't have anything left over from
                    the end of one month to the other. My father's salary of $3,000 a year was a
                    princely sum in 1931 through 1939. Then everything changed. But during those
                    years, people would come and look for food. She would have them in for soup and
                    sandwiches or a piece of pie. She was a good cook. If we were deprived, we
                    didn't know it. We were just so happy. It was very secure.</p>
                <p>Q: I remember the same experience, although I was in Pasadena, California. We
                    lived close to the railroad tracks and people used to come by and ask for
                    food.</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: It was a two-family house. Shortly after I was born, my parents moved
                    in with my maternal grandparents. They were downstairs; we were upstairs. My
                    grandfather died in 1940 when I was nine. So, I had both grandparents for that
                    whole time. It was a tremendous formative influence. It was really a close-knit
                    loving family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your name is of German origin. How about the German
                        influence? This is prior to World War II.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: We were very conscious of being a German-American family, although both
                    my mother and father were born in the United States, probably because my
                    maternal grandparents were so close at hand. My grandfather emigrated in 1890.
                    His name was Mohrmann. Before he left Germany, he felt that he owed his country
                    something, so he did his military service and served from 1888-1890 in the
                    Zweite GardeRegiment zu Fuss. He served in Berlin. 1888 was the so-called
                    “Dreikaiserjahr.” The old Kaiser died and was succeeded by Vicky's husband, who
                    was the great liberal reform hope. He only lasted 100 days and then Kaiser Bill
                    came to the throne. That was important to my grandfather, yet when he came to
                    the United States, there was no question where his loyalty lay. It was very
                    interesting. There was a love of the Heimat, but this was his new country. The
                    real test came with the First World War. He had only one son. His son felt
                    obliged to volunteer. My grandfather understood that and accepted it, but it was
                    painful. His son went into the Navy, but never saw action. He died in the flu
                    epidemic two days before the war ended. He was the only son they had, and then
                    my mother, who was younger. So, I was always aware of the memories of that
                    uncle.</p>
                <p>My grandparents spoke Platt Deutsch at home to one another, so would hear that.
                    But they spoke English to us, of course.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>On my father's side, the family was also German, but I didn't learn about them
                    until much, much later. My father's mother was born in the United States. My
                    father knew that his father had come from Germany but didn't know any of the
                    details. While assigned to Embassy Bonn, my wife and I went rummaging around the
                    churches in southwest Germany. We found that my father's grandparents had
                    emigrated to the U.S. in 1870. My father's father was only four years old.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What effect did the Hitler years have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: It impacted us in the following way. I remember a real serious falling
                    out among old friends in the German-American community. My grandparents belonged
                    to something called the Steuben Society, which was primarily for social
                    contacts, picnics, bus rides, dances etc. But in the 1930s, there were friends
                    of my grandparents who became Hitlerites. My grandparents were not involved, nor
                    did they know people in the Bund, but there were peoplprimarily those who had
                    emigrated a generation later than my grandparentwho spoke out in favor of
                    Hitler. My grandfather wouldn't have any part of that. So, friends really parted
                    over politics in Europe. It was interesting. In 1940, war had already broken out
                    in Europe. The local chapter of the Steuben Society in College Point had a
                    meeting and was thinking maybe they should not march in the Memorial Day parade
                    because there was anti-German sentiment and people questioning whether it was
                    appropriate. My grandfather stood up at the meeting and said his only son had
                    died wearing the uniform of the United States Navy, he was proud to be an
                    American, he was also proud of his German heritage, and if they didn't have the
                    guts to march, he would carry the flag alone. He was 77 at this point. So, in
                    fact, he marched, they marched; it was the biggest turnout the Steuben Society
                    ever had in a Memorial Day parade. He was made the marshal of the third
                    division. As they were marking time to fall into line behind the second
                    division, he dropped dead of a heart attack. Very, very dramatic. It's the way
                    he would have wanted to go. He loved life. He loved to dance and he loved
                    parties and he was very popular. But on that issue, it was quite clear where his
                    loyalties lay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about school there? Let's talk about elementary
                        school.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: I always loved school. PS27. Rella Burke was the principal. It was
                    within walking distance. I was a good scholar. I finished elementary school at
                    12. I had the first six grades at PS27 and then went to a junior high school
                    that was a little further away but also in College Point. Then I went on to
                    Flushing High School.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were in elementary school and maybe a little
                        beyond, wayour family a reading family or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Yes, I loved to read. The same way the family was not into things
                    cultural. Their tastes were very much low middle class. They liked fun. There
                    was a sharp difference between my mother's background, the grandparents and my
                    father's. My father had come from a rather austere background. Dancing,
                    gambling, and carousing of any kind simply were frowned on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this Protestant?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Yes. Both sides of the family were Evangelisch. They were married in
                    the Evangelical Church in College Point. That's where I was baptized. My
                    mother's family loved to gamble and they loved to dance and sing. We always had
                    a lot of fun. For Dad, you had to sort of bring him along. He had a lot of
                    disappointments in life. He didn't expect much.</p>
                <p>Q: Coming from that background, it was not easy.</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: There was a Pietistic movement of people from Switzerland into
                    southwest Germany in the 14th or 15th century. I traced the family roots back to
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you're really going back to John Calvin and that sort
                        of thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about you and reading habits? Was there Carnegie
                        library othe equivalent thereof?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: Yes, we had a good public library. I used it all the time. I did like
                    to read. I came to music fairly early. My father had a collection of “classical”
                    records. Classical meant you never listened to them because they were really
                    special and he got them through Raleigh cigarette coupons. He was a chain smoker
                    and he saved up his coupons and sent off and got Beethoven, Mozart, Brahms et
                    al. Then those albums lay in the basement never to be touched. Once as a special
                    favor to me, I asked if I could listen to those records. Oh, well, he knew he
                    could trust me. I went down. It was an old RCA Victor phonograph. You had to
                    lift up the top and it had a very heavy stylus and these 78 rpm's. You played
                    one side and then had to change the needle. It was Beethoven's Fifth that was
                    the first one, but it was the second movement where something happened. It was a
                    majestic, sweeping sound. I sat there and started to weep. I was all alone in
                    the basement with all these dusty cobwebs around. That was kind of the beginning
                    of a real love for music that has been an important part of my life ever since.
                    I never played an instrument, but loved music, loved opera. A couple of years
                    later, I was a camp counselor. I was in college by then. I earned tips for the
                    summer. At the end of the summer, someone offered me the chance to buy a
                    subscription to the Metropolitan Opera. I used all the money I had earned. I
                    couldn't keep the seat. had it for one year only. It belonged to a family that
                    had had it since the beginning of time. I remember Wagner's “Tristan and Isolde”
                    coming up and I thought that was too heavy for me. My father, who never went to
                    an opera in his life, said, “Do you know this music? How do you know you won't
                    like it?” I said, “It's just such heavy going.” He said, “But you have the
                    ticket. Why don't you go? Then if you don't like it, you'll never have to go
                    again.” Of course, I went and it was one of the most powerful experiences of my
                    life. The same thing when the time came to go on a Fulbright scholarship to
                    Scotland. I was going to turn it down. I also had a scholarship to go to
                    graduate school at Northwestern. My dad was an inspector for the fire
                    department, so he was out of the firehouse a lot and roamed around town, was
                    well-known, well liked. I was working on Saturday mornings in a jewelry store.
                    He stopped by and said, “Mom tells me you're not going to take the Fulbright.” I
                    said, “No, I don't want to waste a year.” He said, “Why do you think you'd waste
                    a year?” I said, “Well, I need to get on with my education.” I was all of 21. “I
                    don't want to lose the scholarship to Northwestern.” He said, “You know, I bet
                    if you write them a nice letter and tell them you have a chance for a Fulbright,
                    they would defer the scholarship for a year. You have no idea what you might do
                    in a year there. You're young enough that you wouldn't waste it.” It was so
                    obvious and I was just too stupid. I listened and I thought about it. I wrote
                    the letter. Northwestern wrote back and said they would be happy to defer the
                    graduate school fellowship for a year. It was a full scholarship. I went to the
                    University of Glasgow and it changed my life. I met my wife and it led to the
                    Foreign Service. I'm jumping ahead here. It all comes back to my father. I owe
                    him so much. He never understood how much he really meant to my brother and
                    me.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: All the usual boys' adventure things, mysteries, and some biography. I
                    had a good English teacher in high school. I enjoyed reading Lowell Thomas and
                    Richard Haliburton.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: It was the same high school my mother had gone to for one year. I
                    managed to stay for four. It was in the neighboring town of Flushing, so I had
                    to take the bus. Ethnic mix? I don't know how conscious I was of that at that
                    time. I guess northern Queens was still predominantly white although there was a
                    significant black population. It was a very good high school. I enjoyed it
                    immensely. Good teachers. I graduated salutatorian. I particularly enjoyed
                    history, languages. I took Spanish and French. Members of the faculty had
                    dissuaded me from taking the third year of French because I did too much foreign
                    languages and should concentrate on science. I thought later in the Foreign
                    Service how much I would have liked that third year of French. I was very
                    social. I liked fun. I was no athlete. I guess I was fairly popular.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: I started in February. That was still at the time when people graduated
                    in January. That all ended a couple of years later. I went to college in 1948,
                    so I had to wait six months.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Avidly. We didn't get “The New York Times.” We got “The Daily News.”
                    But opposite the editorial page, there would always be a map of the Russian
                    front. I remember following where things were happening, although when the war
                    broke out, December 7, 1941, our tenant came down and said, “The Japanese just
                    bombed Pearl Harbor.” I didn't know where Pearl Harbor was. I was 10 at that
                    time. I remember the air raid drills, going under your desk and covering your
                    head and all the things. In those early days there was kind of a sense of
                    imminent danger. That soon passed.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: No. I was aware of some of the things that featured ithe war, but I
                    can't say I had a particular interest in things military.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Yes, great interest. Always fascinated by places. We got “The National
                    Geographic.” When my wife first visited before we were even engaged, she had an
                    evening alone with my father and they went into the basement and he was showing
                    her things he had made. He was very clever with his hands. He had done a replica
                    of our Lutheran church. He had done various things for Christmas and then showed
                    things that my brother had done, a Scottie lamp and bookcase he had made. She
                    said, “What did Bill do?” He thought a minute and turned and pointed to a shelf
                    on the side wall filled top to bottom with “National Geographics” and said,
                    “Bill did those.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any particular concentration in history?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Certainly American history. We got so much of it. I majored in history
                    in college and then in graduate school was into diplomatic history. So, it's a
                    thread that ran right through from the earliest days. Ancient history also
                    intrigued mthe Greeks, Romans, and Egyptians. I also took a great interest in
                    history that had to do with religion. I was very religious. That gives a totally
                    misleading picture, but I was very interested in religion and believed deeply. I
                    was confirmed a Lutheran. But it was during those years that I began to question
                    my faith very strenuously. So, I read a lot of things that had biblical
                    exegesis, the history of biblical times. I went through a very wrenching time
                    and even went and had a private session with my pastor. Instead of addressing my
                    concerns and my real questions about faith, he nailed Jesus to the cross for me.
                    I had the benefit of a private Lenten sermon. That may have been critical. Maybe
                    it wouldn't have changed things anyway. But in those two years, 16 and 17, I
                    really fell away from my faith completely until finally there was nothing left.
                    I said, well, the one thing I knew I would never lose was my faith in Christ as
                    a personal savior. Of course, that went, too. Although my parents were both
                    believing Christians and what the pastor used to call “four wheelers” because
                    they went to church for baptisms, confirmation, the wedding, and the funeral,
                    unlike some of my aunts and uncles, they were not truly devout. The important
                    thing was that they did not put undue pressure on me. I seriously thought of
                    going to a seminary to become a minister. That changed in those years when I was
                    16-18. I think they probably were disappointed. My father would have gone to a
                    Lutheran seminary (He was offered a scholarship.) if it hadn't been for the fact
                    that when he came out of the orphanage, he had to work to support his mother. He
                    in particular would have been pleased if I had chosen the ministry, but they
                    never reproved me in any way or exerted pressure. That is another thing for
                    which I am eternally grateful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your brother take a different course than you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: Yes, totally different. You would find it hard to believe we were
                    brothers. Although he's two and a half years younger, he came through four years
                    later. When I think back, some of those teachers should have been horsewhipped.
                    “Oh, you're Billy's little brother. Oh, you're not like Billy.” Billy was an
                    outstanding student and a really goody two shoes. Richard was very different.
                    So, not surprisingly, he was clever with his hands where I wasn't. He was an
                    athlete where I wasn't. He was not a scholar, but what he did excel in were the
                    natural sciences, which I had no aptitude for. Yet he and I were and have
                    remained to this day very, very close. He pursued a career in aeronautical
                    engineering, went to Grumman and did very well, wound up on the LEM project, the
                    Moon thing. No, very different. A math teacher in high school whom I was close
                    to, who liked me and enjoyed me but recognized how good my brother was, took him
                    aside once and said, “You're not your brother. You never will be your brother.
                    You shouldn't want to be your brother.” I think this for the first time
                    instilled in him some self-esteem in the sense that he didn't have to be another
                    Bill Woessner.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you graduated in 1948, what did you want to do? The
                        drafhad stopped by this time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Yes. I graduated from high school. I knew I was going on to college.
                    Graduation was in January and I couldn't get into college until September. The
                    first thing I remember was this tremendous aching, emptiness inside. These had
                    been four immensely happy years. Everything was so uncertain. I took a job in
                    Central Library in Queens County just to mark time and earn a little money and
                    then went to college in September. I was a semifinalist for a Rhodes scholarship
                    and also a semifinalist for a full four-year scholarship to Columbia University.
                    Instead, I went to Queens College, which was again a bus ride from home. So, I
                    lived at home. I had an absolutely fabulous experience. I've always enjoyed
                    school and those four years of college were marvelous years. It was a good
                    school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk about Queens College.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: It had been a boys reformatory. When we were kids and we were
                    misbehaving, Mother always said we'd wind up there, and I did. It had a nice
                    campus. It wasn't built up yet the way it is today. It was part of the city
                    higher education system, so it was free education. My parents did not have to
                    mortgage the house or do any of the things they were prepared to do. There, I
                    guess, much more than in high school, I became aware of the diversity of society
                    and had friends from all walks of life and all backgrounds. That network of
                    friends was quite strong. There was something about my family that attracted so
                    many of them. I won't say they all came from dysfunctional families or unhappy
                    backgrounds, but there was some element of that. People could always come home
                    with me. I could bring people home without prior notice and say, “Put some water
                    in the soup.” Mom was always very welcoming. We had lots of parties at the
                    house. Those were just wonderful, fun years.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>Academics were a breeze. It was too easy for me, I think.</p>
                <p>Q: When one thinks of the New York system, one always thinks of the heavy
                    influence of Jewish immigration. Was that impacting there? This was a group
                    that, particularly in those days, gave great emphasis on moving up and ahead and
                    competitiveness.</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Yes. I think that was very evident. I had a lot of Jewish friends. My
                    closest friend in grammar school was a Jewish boy and my closest friend in high
                    school was a Jewish girl. Then I had lots of Jewish friends in college, but also
                    lots of non-Jewish friends and black friends. In College Point, there were no
                    blacks, so the first time blacks came home with me, it was something of an
                    eye-opener. Like the bus driver, “You got on the wrong bus” kind of thing. “No,
                    we're not on the wrong bus.”</p>
                <p>Yes, there was a striving for academic excellence, but I wouldn't want to give
                    the impression of being bookwormish. It wasn't that at all. It was stimulating
                    and fun. I got into campus politics. I had no interest in politics. I had a
                    friend who was a Young Republican and the Young Republicans were practically an
                    underground organization. There was a big fight between Stalinists and reform
                    communists. “The Daily Worker” was sold at the gates of the college and campus
                    was a hotbed of real radicalism. People would take up all these screwball causes
                    and demonstrate. I just thought the whole thing was such rubbish. I remember
                    somebody from the Yugoslav trade mission or consulate came to campus after
                    Tito's break with Stalin and he was harassed. It was a big rumpus on campus.
                    This Young Republican friend of mine said, “I want you to stand for student
                    council.” I said, “I don't want to do that, Roger.” He said, “Oh, please, it
                    would make such a difference.” I said, “Yes,” but didn't do anything. On the
                    Friday afternoon that was the deadline for submitting a nomination for
                    candidacy, as I was leaving heading down the hill towards the bus stop, Roger
                    came running after me. He said, “Willy, did you register?” I said, “Oh, Roger,
                    you couldn't be serious. No, I did not.” “Well, please.” He literally hauled me
                    back, took me in, and I registered. I had to give my platform. I wrote down,
                    “More sex and less politics on campus.” That was my platform. This was a school
                    where people took their politics seriously. No surprise. I won a landslide
                    victory. I wound up on student council in spite of myself. That was fun, too.
                    Then I was reelected, so I was there in my senior year as well. Good teachers,
                    too. Wonderful teachers.</p>

                <p>WOESSNER: It was my milieu. That's what was easy. A sidebar here on the Foreign
                    Service. I didn't find out until I headed the political panel of the Board of
                    Examiners that the score that I had posted when I took the exam many years
                    earlier was unusually high - which said to me that there's not a great deal of
                    correlation between success on that exam (You can be bright as a button) and the
                    things that make you a success as a Foreign Service officer. On the BEX panel we
                    interviewed candidates from Georgetown, Fletcher, or whatever, who were high
                    flyers academically and somehow thought that gave them a God-given right to come
                    into the Foreign Service and we were turning some of them down. That's not
                    what's going to make it for you in the Foreign Service. I haven't thought about
                    all that in a long time.</p>
                <p>Yes, I liked school. It was fun. It was easy. I had top grades. was

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about social life at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Very social. Among other things, I was introduced to a Christian
                    Science Monitor youth group. They were a delightful bunch of young people who
                    were different from all the friends I had on campus. I was very active with them
                    in their social affairs and theatrical productions. I had always enjoyed
                    theatrical things, even in grammar school. But then one day they approached me
                    and said it had been two years that I had been with them and was I not
                    interested in becoming a Christian Scientist? I said, “No, not remotely. I
                    thought that was understood from the beginning.” Then they politely asked if I
                    would cease and desist. About half of the membership, most of them girls, broke
                    away. Ah, well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were taking history. Were you looking_</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: No idea. I wish I could tell you I had a vision of wherI was going to
                    go, but I just rode along.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that when most of us look back, myself included,
                        it waone day at a time more or less.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: I can tell you when I showed an interest in the Foreign Service. That
                    was thanks to a man who had a fellowship at Queens College. He had just
                    graduated and while going for a graduate degree, taught some classes in colonial
                    history. I was one of his students. He entered the Foreign Service while I was
                    overseas on my Fulbright year. When I came back, he told me about it and thought
                    that I would be interested. That sparked the interest that finally led to my
                    sitting the exam. Manyears later his final assignment in the Foreign Service was
                    as economic minister-counselor at Embassy Bonn while I was DCM. We have been
                    friends all these many, many, many years.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Charlie York. A great guy.</p>

                <p>Q: You were saying you were going to Northwestern and then you decided to get the
                    Fulbright. What put you off on this course, one to go to Northwestern and the
                    other to apply for a Fulbright?</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: The story of how I applied for the Fulbright is very inspiring(Ha!). I
                    had a history professor who saw in me the college's first chance to get a
                    Fulbright. I said that I didn't have any particular interest in going overseas
                    to study. “Oh, but this Fulbright is terribly important and you'd be a good
                    candidate. I really want you to try-” (end of tape)</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>He said, “You're going to do a research paper on English constitutional history.”
                    I said, “What? Are you mad?” I had had a course in English constitutional
                    history with one of the best professors I ever knew, Gaudens Megaro. He had been
                    in the OSS during the war and was a real maverick. He made constitutional
                    history come alive. It was so current - the relevance of what happened in the
                    fight between the kings and the barons to what was happening today. But beyond
                    that one course, no way. He said, “You need to have a project and it needs to be
                    something that can only be done at a foreign university.” He knew some professor
                    in Leeds or somewhere. This whole thing seemed so calculated to me, but I went
                    along. It was important to him. He wanted me to do it. So, we put in that I
                    would do constitutional struggles under the Later Stuarts. It was that focused.
                    And I forgot about it. I had applied for a fellowship, a graduate scholarship,
                    to go to Northwestern and I received notice that it had been granted. I was
                    looking forward to that. Arthur Link was there, as was Richard Leopold, who was
                    at times an advisor to the State Department. He was teaching diplomatic history
                    at Northwestern. They had a good history department. Then the letter came that I
                    had been granted a Fulbright to go to Glasgow University. I said, “Glasgow?
                    Where is that?” I told you the story of how I finally came to accept that and
                    postponed Northwestern. But I was terrified. Here I was going with completely
                    false credentials. I would be exposed as a fraud.I arrived in Glasgow in
                    September of 1952. Nine girls came to see me off. None of them was there when I
                    came back, but that is another story. It was all so different. It's a very old
                    fashioned university, was in those days. “The professor will see you in a week
                    or two.” You just wandered around and had no orientation, no bearings as to what
                    was happening. The “professor” referred to the one who was head of the
                    department, whose name was Browning. The students held him in awe, not to say
                    terror. He received me in his chambers that looked like an ad for a man of
                    distinction holding a glass of whiskey. The light was streaming through. I
                    thought, “This is it.” I went in and we chatted a while. Then he told me that I
                    would be studying under Esmond Wright, but Esmond Wright was in the United
                    States right now and it would be another two weeks before he came back. So, I
                    couldn't do anything but wait two weeks until he came back. He happened to
                    mention that Wright's specialty was American colonial history. I left totally
                    nonplused. Whatever happened to English constitutional struggles under the Later
                    Stuarts? I didn't raise that specter at all. It was many years later and by
                    accident in a conversation with my wife, who also was a student under Professor
                    Browning, that I found out. There was indeed professor of constitutional history
                    at Glasgow. His name was Chrimes. He and Professor Browning had a blood feud.
                    They hated one another. The last thing Browning would ever have done was to give
                    his Fulbright student for the year to Chrimes. That's how it worked. Years
                    later, I served on the Fulbright Commission both in London and in Bonn. I
                    thought back to the way I had been selected. Scandalous, no doubt, but it was a
                    life-transforming year, which is what they wanted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk about that. First, this was still a period of
                        greaausterity, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you adjust to this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: I'm adjustable. It was an adventure. It was exciting. It was fun. I
                    never guessed they were still on rationing. I went into a hall of residence,
                    which was on a hill opposite Gilmore Hill, where the university was. You had to
                    go down into the park and then up the other side. In the hall of residence,
                    there were primarily Scots, but also several English students. There were two
                    Cypriots, a couple of Africans. It was an interesting mix, all boys, of course.
                    The matron was out of Dickens, really severe. We had to give in our ration
                    books. We got three eggs a week. There were real limits on meat and other
                    things. So, yes, you were aware that here in the fall of 1952, seven years after
                    the war ended, there was still great austerity. But before getting to that, I
                    should mention the briefing we had in London to get ready for our Fulbright
                    year. The final speaker finished his remarks with “Here you are in a Fulbright
                    year, a great opportunity. Don't let your studies interfere with your
                    education.” That's all I needed to hear. That was my watchword for the year. So,
                    I took Russian language. I took a course in Eastern European studies. Obviously,
                    I had American colonial history with Professor Wright, who became a close friend
                    to my wife and me. He later became a Member of Parliament. We renewed our
                    friendship during the five years we were at Embassy London. I thoroughly enjoyed
                    my year in Glasgow. That is where I met my wife. We married three years later.
                    The friendships I made, some of them have held up to this day. People were very,
                    very hospitable. The Scots are really wonderful people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get a feel for the politics of Scotland and the
                        English?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: It is a distinct culture, a distinct nation. Scotland has its own
                    educational and legal system, its own established church and many of the
                    features of a separate country. National pride and cultural nationalism are very
                    strong. I just ate it up. Even the maudlin stories about the Jacobites and
                    Prince Charlie. I visited many of the historical sites and spent a lot of time
                    in the Burns country. It has been a powerful influence in our married life. My
                    wife is a Scot. You see it in all of the children. We celebrated St. Andrews
                    night last year. The three boys were all in their kilts and the girls their
                    tartans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling there towards the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: I would say there was a profound sense of friendship and sympathy and
                    gratitude and all that, more than probably in England. But there also was a
                    tinge of ambivalence, much stronger in England, a problem with the past and with
                    the loss of empire.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>But basically you didn't experience anti-Americanism. We got that later in
                    continental circles among intellectuals and opinion makers and so on. That is a
                    whole subject unto itself, but in our Foreign Service years, our first three
                    assignments were Vienna, Warsaw, and Berlin. In each of them, there was a
                    powerful popular love for all things American. Not always among intellectuals,
                    but among ordinary people, deep gratitude because they knew how much they owed
                    to American support. But that's getting ahead of the story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you picking up British politics, particular Labour
                        versuConservative?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Yes, a lot of it. Scottish nationalism, the Scot Nats were in their
                    first full flower. It was during my year there that Ian Hamilton and other
                    students stole the Stone of Scone, carted it off in the boot of a small car, and
                    broke it! My wife knew Hamilton and we met up with him about a year ago in
                    Florida, but that's another story. So, you had the Scot Nats. It was also the
                    year of the coronation. I went to London. Classes ended in May. I hiked through
                    the highlands, went with some friends to the Isle of Skye, those sort of things.
                    But I was in London in time for the coronation. It was a year of powerful
                    emotions. I loved these people. I loved the experience. I loved everything. To
                    be young and so impressionable. It's hard to capture it all in words, the
                    friendships I made. At the end of the year, when I left the hall of residence to
                    go to the train station to take an overnight train to London, nobody had alerted
                    me to this, but virtually all the guys of the hall came to see me off. They
                    stood on the platform and sang, “Will ye no come back again.” I was bawling my
                    head off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say you met your wife. What was her background?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: Her dad was a chartered public accountant. The family came from around
                    Loch Awe, but lived south of Glasgow. They were quite well to do upper middle
                    class prior to the war. They had a nanny. It was a big family. But their
                    fortunes turned after the war when most of my father-in-law's clients were
                    nationalized. They lived in more straitened circumstances after that. My wife
                    was the second child. Her brother, the oldest, was killed in an automobile
                    accident. He was only seven. His death affected the family deeply. My wife was
                    very independent, very strong-minded, exhibiting a lot of the influence of her
                    mother, who came from an Ulster background. She was a top student and a gifted
                    linguist. She wanted to go to university, but her father couldn't see that,
                    thought it was a waste of time. Her place was at home. It was only by winning a
                    dramatic acting scholarship to a school in Belfast that she blackmailed him into
                    letting her go to Glasgow University. The last thing he wanted was a daughter on
                    the stage. She did very well at Glasgow and that's where we met. She was a third
                    year student when I was there as a graduate student. We were in one of these big
                    lecture halls. She came down to talk to me the first day of class in the New
                    Year. She asked if I had had a good Hogmanay. I said, “I don't know what you
                    mean.” Hogmanay was the biggest holiday of the year. It was New Year's Eve. I
                    said, “Oh, I'm afraid not. I was on the Continent. I went to visit relatives in
                    Germany and then I went to Paris for New Year's Eve.” She said, “How could you
                    not be in Scotland.” One word led to another. Then she invited me to her home
                    for a canasta party (which dates this story). I was to be a date for her friend.
                    I didn't know that. By the time the canasta party was over, her version is that
                    she had made up her mind. She gave up her Scottish boyfriend and, she says, set
                    her cap for me. That was the beginning of a wonderfully erratic courtship. As
                    everyone likes to remind me, the smartest thing I ever did was to marry Sheila.
                    It certainly was and much, much more. But she had to fight to get away from
                    home. She secured a position with the British Foreign Office. Her father didn't
                    want her to take it. So, she went to London without his blessing. That was very,
                    very hard. Then she compounded that by emigrating to the United States. It took
                    him a while to forgive her. He had certain expectations. She wanted to be
                    independent. It was not easy. She had a lot of guts.</p>

                <p>WOESSNER: I came back when the Fulbright year was over. I went to London for the
                    coronation, but instead of going straight home, I hitchhiked around Germany and
                    Austria for 10 weeks with a rucksack. I stayed at youth hostels. That was a
                    great adventure. I didn't get home until September and then went directly to
                    Northwestern.</p>

                <p>WOESSNER: No. What I did encounter was a deep revulsion against any use of
                    military force. That lesson had gone in very deep. The aftermath of the war was
                    still very evident everywhere. I went to Cologne. That was the first major city
                    I saw. It was the last major German city to be rebuilt. When I got there, if you
                    left the immediate town center where the cathedral was still propped up with
                    great logs and sandbags and there was a facade of stores, beyond that there were
                    just miles and miles of rubble as far as the eye could see. I was not prepared
                    for that. But I stayed in a youth hostel there. I walked along the Rhine, the
                    high ground above the river, and it was up there where somebody had a portable
                    radio and I first heard the news of the uprising in East Berlin in June of 1953.
                    I carried a rucksack and hitchhiked as well as walked. Germans were very keen to
                    pick you up because of the chance for contact with foreigners. They were very
                    hospitable. They didn't have much but would share what they had. It gave me a
                    chance to practice my very feeble German. That was fun. I carried a dictionary
                    with me all the time. I went through the Black Forest.</p>
                <p>Austria was still under occupation. Vienna was under four-power administration. I
                    went by train through the British zone from Linz, into the Soviet zone and
                    enjoyed being in Vienna. It was exciting. I saw the change of guards when the
                    Russians took over from the Americans. Four years later I returned for my first
                    posting in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came back in 1953. How long were you at
                        Northwestern?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: One year. It was a full scholarship for my master's degree. I did an
                    honors paper on Pershing's raid into Mexico and did research in the Library of
                    Congress on Wilson's diary and that sort of stuff. Arthur Link was my professor
                    for that. It was good. I was a straight A student. They wanted to renew the
                    fellowship so I could go on for a doctorate. But by that time, the notion of
                    going into the Foreign Service had already been planted. My father said, “Are
                    you ever going to work for a living or just go on and study forever?” I said,
                    “No, I think that's it.” I turned down the fellowship and volunteered for the
                    draft. The draft was still in effect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The draft went out in 1946 and then with the Korean War in
                        1950,it came back in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: It certainly was in effect in 1954. I could have kept on applying for
                    deferment, but I wanted to get it over with. That was a very good experience,
                    two years in the Army.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in from 1954 to 1956.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: The summer of 1954 to the summer of 1956.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Basic training was at Fort Dix. I was assigned to Fort Monmouth to do
                    I&amp;E (information and education) work. From there, I was assigned to Fort
                    Slocum, to the I&amp;E school. Each assignment brought me progressively closer
                    to home. My uncle claimed I was going to defend Long Island against Russian
                    submarines. I went to the I&amp;E school and finished top of the class. The
                    faculty asked me to stay on. I did. A wonderful experience there. I actually
                    liked being in the Army. I particularly liked basic training because I met
                    people that I never would have met in any other way. I said it then and I say it
                    still, I understand all the reasons why the draft was abolished but yet I regret
                    it because in a democracy I think it's important that if you're not in actual
                    military service then there should be some alternative service where you're
                    exposed to all walks of life. It was a good experience. And I liked the physical
                    part, too, because I was never an athlete, but basic training was a hoot. I
                    laughed my way through that for eight weeks. Out doing things. Being so close to
                    home, I had altogether eight weeks of leave. Four weeks a year. I took the first
                    three weeks and hitchhiked on a MATS flight to Germany and visited relatives
                    there that I had gotten to know during my Fulbright year. Then at the end of my
                    tour of duty, I took five weeks and hitchhiked to Scotland, renewed the
                    courtship with my wife. That was fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the time you were training at Ford Monmouth, what
                        was youimpression of the recruits coming through?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Quite a few of the college graduates were real snobs. They thought they
                    were better than the sergeants that they were mixed in with. The sergeants were
                    assigned to the school to upgrade their education. Many of the young guys with
                    college degrees had a superior attitude that just bugged me. I gave tutoring
                    classes after hours for the NCOs because they needed the extra help. I couldn't
                    help but think of my father and how he would have felt in this situation.</p>
                <p>Q: I was an enlisted man for four years after graduating from college. My
                    impression was that one good sergeant was worth about four normal college
                    graduates from the better schools.</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: If I were going into combat, then the answer was so obvious. I rose to
                    the exalted rank of PFC and the Army wanted very strongly for me to attend
                    officers' candidate school. It was a good experience but I did not want to make
                    a career in the Army. I said, “No” and was discharged six weeks early on June
                    30, 1956. In September, I went into the Foreign Service. But that's another
                    chapter.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Q: Why don't we cut off at this point? We'll pick this up in 1956. You've already
                    talked a little about what led you into the Foreign Service, but I'd like to
                    talk about the exam and what you were gathering about the Foreign Service, the
                    real motivation to go in.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is December 8, 1999. You're coming into the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: I entered the Service in 1956.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you came in, were you picking up anything about the
                        ForeigService? Did you do any research?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: My interest in coming in started during my Fulbright year overseas. I
                    believe I mentioned that a man who had taught me in college himself went into
                    the Foreign Service and encouraged me. When I finished my graduate degree, I
                    volunteered for the draft to get that out of the way. While I was in the Army, I
                    sat the written exam and then took my orals. I remember going for my orals in
                    uniform. As far as knowing about the Foreign Service, I'm amazed how ignorant I
                    was. In fact, when the chairman of the board who examined me called me back in
                    to tell me that I had been accepted and congratulated me and wished me a good
                    career and all that, he said, “Just one word of advice. I suggest before you
                    enter the Foreign Service, you might want to find out a little something what
                    it's all about.”</p>
                <p>I was discharged from the Army in June of 1956 and got a call to report to
                    Washington in July. I said, “I was really planning to treat my parents for their
                    silver wedding to a trip to Europe and to go with them. Could I enter the
                    September class instead of in July?” They said, “Of course.” What they didn't
                    tell me was that a change in the grade structure was imminent. The lowest grade
                    was FS-06 in June. In August, it was changed it to FS-08. All those who entered
                    in the July class as FS-06s automatically became FS-07s in August. I came in as
                    an 08 in September. It took me two and a half years to make 07. So, that was a
                    costly trip to Europe with my parents. But I entered in September. That was a
                    class the stars fell on because in the first weeks at the Foreign Service
                    Institute [FSI], the A-100 course, you had the Suez invasion and the war there;
                    the uprisings in Hungary and the crushing of that; and Poland teetering on the
                    verge. We would flock around the tickertapes on every break and every chance we
                    had. It was a very exciting time to come into the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about the members of your class? Can
                        yocharacterize them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: We were a large class of 32 students. There may have been four or five
                    women. I don't believe any particular attention was being paid at that time to
                    diversity. It was a very congenial group. I was struck how much experience some
                    of them had. I remember one officer came in with seven languages and he was five
                    years older than the rest of us. He went on to be my supervisor in Berlin years
                    later and somebody who is still a friend. The group was enthusiastic and
                    evidenced very little cynicism. There was a sense that this was an exciting
                    career we had chosen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the basic training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: I don't remember all that much about it now. But at the time, again, I
                    responded very positively. It was all new and all exciting. Then the big
                    anticipation was your onward assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came in, I think there was always a wish
                        list.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: You had to fill out a form that asked, “What is your career ambition?
                    What would you like to be?” I said, “Well, I guess you aim for the top.
                    Secretary of State.” So, they took me aside and said, “Ambition is laudable but
                    usually one aspires ultimately to becoming an ambassador. Really the Secretary
                    of State is not up for grabs.” In later years, of course, the Service came close
                    - hitting the number two with Walter Stoessel, who was my ambassador in Germany
                    and somebody I loved dearly. No, I didn't have any strong sense of where I
                    wanted to go, what I wanted to do. Those interests developed later. In fact, my
                    first assignment was somewhat accidental.</p>
                <p>I had to go to the FSI German class because my German was 2+ and they wanted to
                    get it up to 3 before I went out. There were openings in both Vienna and Munich
                    and the man who made my assignment sent me to Vienna, thinking it would be
                    better to have an embassy experience. It would be a broader experience than the
                    consulate general. As it turned out, there was no JOT [junior officer training]
                    program in those days. So, there was no rotation. I spent the two years in the
                    consulate in Vienna. The consulate was physically separate from the embassy. I
                    was well into my second year in Vienna before I even set foot in the embassy.
                    But it was a fantastic experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from 1956-1958?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: I was in FSI for the A-100 class, followed by German language. There
                    was no consular training course at that time. I just went out. I went out in
                    May. Sheila and I got married in March, so this was really our honeymoon. I was
                    there from May of 1957 until July of 1959.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you talk about Vienna in 1957?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: They were fresh out from under the Four-Power occupation. During that
                    Fulbright year, I had actually taken a train into Vienna while it was still
                    under occupation, so I remembered it from that time. But they were starting to
                    spruce things up. The Opera had been restored. People were investing money in
                    shop fronts and it was a lot of fun to be there. It's a romantic city with the
                    old fashioned schmaltz. Several things about the Viennese struck me. How
                    resolutely they looked backwards. It was as if the Kaiser had died the year
                    before. Fresh flowers were on the Kaiser's statue. Franz Josef died in 1916. All
                    the old traditions were still kept very much alive. The operetta was very good.
                    We were on honeymoon enjoying everything. We traveled a lot, took in whatever we
                    could afford on our limited budget. Our first son was born there. We named him
                    after St. Stephens Cathedral, the Stefansdom. If it had been a girl, it would
                    have been Elizabeth for the Kaiserin Elizabeth. That's the kind of mood we were
                    in. In fact, we saved the name for our third child. In the office, the first
                    year I did immigrant visa work and then the second year non-immigrant visa work.
                    It was a lively staff, a lot of fun. I found it very satisfying. The camps were
                    still full from the Hungarian uprising.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in refugee work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Yes, but only in the sense that the great movement of refugees had
                    already taken place out of the camps and to the United States. Those who were
                    left were the hardcore people with tuberculosis or people with particular
                    placement problems. I dealt in that first year with the various relief
                    organizations. HIAS was particularly effective. There was the National Council
                    of Churches and a Catholic relief group and the Tolstoy Foundation. A lot of
                    Hungarian refugees were still trickling into the U.S. Every case had to be
                    processed very carefully. I got an enormous amount of personal satisfaction out
                    of helping these refugees. I remember one man coming in. He was a rabbi and his
                    whole family had perished in the Holocaust. In the course of the interview, he
                    showed me a picture of his wife and four or five children, all of whom had been
                    slaughtered. That was his first family. He had remarried and proudly introduced
                    me to his new family. It brought home to me just what we had been spared in the
                    U.S. The immediacy of the war, the aftermath. Everybody had stories whether it
                    was those in the camps or those who had lived through the Soviet taking of the
                    city when all the women were raped. There was an enormous reservoir of popular
                    goodwill towards the United States, gratitude for all that we had done. But here
                    it was 1957. The war had been over 12 years and in many ways it was still very
                    fresh. That was something I experienced again at the next post in Poland.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>Q: I was in the Refugee Relief Program for part of this time in Frankfurt. I got
                    there in 1955. One of the things I got from this was a tremendous lesson in
                    postwar and war history about migrations, where people came from and all that. I
                    imagine you were getting the same.</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Oh, yes. It was an exposure to a living history. For me,it was
                    exciting.</p>

                <p>WOESSNER: No, very little of that. The ones coming througprimarily were from the
                    Hungarian uprising.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your impression of how the Hungarians were being relocated in the
                    U.S.?</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: No idea what happened to them afterwards. The INS played a key role in
                    the processing of all these. But I had the sense from what I heard that those
                    who were taken care of by the relief organizations were well taken care of.
                    These were very effective, efficient operations from getting them cleared
                    through the immigration hurdles to resettling them after they were in the U.S.
                    But I didn't have any personal experience of a resettling.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you find the outlook of the consular officers? Who was running the
                    Consular Section? Sometimes you have old hands who have been there, seen that,
                    done that.</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Yes. It was a small section. This was not a visa mill. But those of us
                    who were on the line and doing the actual processing, we weren't at all jaded.
                    We were too fresh. It was too new and it was very emotional in many ways. It
                    gave me a great sense of satisfaction. The head of the Immigrant Visa Section
                    was a woman who was the widow of an FSO who had died in internment by the
                    Japanese in Shanghai, China, not through mistreatment but he had had an
                    accident. She could be rather difficult. Her behavior was such that in this day
                    and age...well, it was just outrageous. Talk about sexual harassment. We didn't
                    think in those terms then. She must have been 50 and took an unhealthy interest
                    in her junior male officers. One young bachelor had a particularly rough time
                    fending her off. It wasn't easy for my wife either but we managed. That was
                    another age. As far as her attitudes toward all this, yes, she had seen
                    everything, done everything, and we had to listen interminably to how much
                    better things had been in Shanghai.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sometimes you run across people who were very
                        unsympathetic tthe difficulties of clients.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: This was not true here. It wasn't a question of lack of sympathy. She
                    had an alcohol problem. She was very wrapped up in her own personal world. But
                    she did not interfere in the way we conducted business. No, there was no lack of
                    sympathy. The only time I ever noticed a lack of sympathy was when I was doing
                    nonimmigrant work in the second year. One applicant who was mentally deranged
                    would come to the counter every six months or so and give the locals a hard time
                    and then some poor, unsuspecting vice consul would have to go up and deal with
                    him. The consul general said one time, “Gee, if only he'd pull a knife on a vice
                    consul once, maybe we could do something about it.” I thought that lacked
                    sympathy, but perhaps that's not the kind you meant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There is always one or two of those that the vice consul
                        getstuck with.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: But the staff was wonderful. We got to know them all socially and
                    personally. A lot of those friendships lasted for years afterwards. (End of
                    tape)</p>
                <p>When we left post, the entire staff gathered outside the consulate. The baby was
                    decked out in his Lederhosen and everyone fussed over him. As we drove off, I
                    was weeping so much I couldn't drive. Two blocks away I had to pull over. It was
                    that kind of emotion. I think that probably nothing equals your first post in
                    terms of emotional attachment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any contact with the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: No. I didn't set foot in the embassy until well into my second year.
                    That's something my boss discouraged. I did indicate several times that I would
                    like to know what goes on in the Political and Economic Sections or something of
                    how an embassy worked. She said, “What's the matter, consular work not good
                    enough for you?” It was that sort of an attitude. But despite her objections, at
                    one point I was actually invited to come over and attend the ambassador's staff
                    meeting. He was a fine ambassador. I could see him lean over to the DCM and ask
                    who that person was down at the end of the table there. I had been there 18
                    months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you looking forward to doing once you left? Did
                        you have any choice? Did you know where you wanted to go?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: By that time, I had a real sense that the future of so much in Europe
                    was going to revolve around Germany. That was self-evident. I was particularly
                    interested in studying the Soviet-German relationship. I had taken some basic
                    Russian during my Fulbright year. I indicated that was a field I would be
                    interested in. The Department responded that Russian language and area studies
                    were heavily oversubscribed and suggested I go for a year of Polish language to
                    be followed with an assignment to Warsaw, again in consular work. I had hoped to
                    do something different, but I didn't havhang-ups on that. If that's what the
                    Department recommended, it sounded fun and exciting. That's in fact what I
                    did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You took Polish from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: 1959-1960, one year at FSI. We were a small group. Wwere four officers
                    and one spouse.</p>
                <p>Q: Often one picks up a considerable amount of knowledge about the country from
                    the language instructors. Were you getting anything about Poland?</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Yes, enormous. Our instructor was Adam Wojna. His brother, Richard, had
                    stayed behind in Poland and in fact was an apparatchik. He was into Polish press
                    and media work and was a loyalist. Adam and Richard were estranged, but Adam in
                    his own way was very politically interested. So, we had a huge dose of what was
                    going on in Poland that went well beyond the actual language. I thought it was
                    superb instruction. The way it was done was six hours in the classroom with no
                    windows and you go round and round and round, taking the tapes home and studying
                    them. Halfway through that year, I was starting to dream in Polish. I would wake
                    up babbling in Polish and my wife would shake me. Those friendships were pretty
                    intense, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was in your class?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Bill Buell most notably. He went out to the Political Section when I
                    went out to the Consular Section. There was Ross Titus, who specialized in East
                    European Affairs after Warsaw, but left the Service early because of his wife's
                    illness. And Greg Nowakoski. It was a good group. All four of us went to Poland.
                    Gomulka had come to power after the near-uprising in 1956. The effects still
                    lingered, the last vestiges of freedom. Collectivization of agriculture had been
                    called off. There was a lot of intellectual freedom and freedom of speech. The
                    clampdown from the secret police and all the rest came in the middle of my tour
                    in Warsaw. So, we had a chance to compare what it was like before and after.</p>

                <p>WOESSNER: 1962, a two year assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Jake Beam, but not for the whole time. He left a year later and was
                    succeeded by John Moors Cabot. Both men were exceptionally competent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you see Poland when you arrived in 1960?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: You were struck by how shabby things were. There is a smell to Eastern
                    Europe and I encountered it there for the first time. Almost from the outset, I
                    developed a very high regard for the Polish people. This amazing spirit, this
                    vitality surrounded by deprivation that never seemed to get them down. Nor did
                    they ever seem intimidated. There were always ways around. They had a wicked
                    sense of humor, which was a saving grace. We became very friendly with many
                    Poles. During the first year, there was no problem having them to the house for
                    parties, doing things with them, going to their homes. We were struck by the
                    Polish sense of hospitality and I came to realize later that this was really a
                    Slavic tradition. You cannot do anything for a Pole or give anything to a Pole
                    without it being reciprocated in full measure and then some. That becomes hard
                    when you know how little these people have. I remember at one point Bill Buell's
                    wife, Jeanne, and the Tituses, Ross and Marian, and Sheila and I went off
                    traveling around Poland just to see some things. We were on our way to Krakow.
                    We went through Czestojowa, which is where the great shrine is, the Black
                    Madonna, where Mary appeared in the clouds and the Poles defeated the Swedish
                    army and drove them back.This is still a place of great pilgrimage. The regime
                    did everything possible to discourage pilgrims. The train service would be cut
                    off and you would be harassed if you didn't show up for work. Nonetheless, they
                    came from all over Poland on foot, quite remarkable. Anyway, we went through
                    Czestojowa and while the other four were off doing something, I wandered on my
                    own and struck up a conversation. One thing led to another. It was a very nice
                    lady. I played it dumb, saying, “What's going on here?” She explained to me what
                    an important feast day it was and that pilgrims were coming from all over. I
                    said, “That's fascinating. We're on our way to Krakow.” She said, “Krakow? Why
                    would you go to Krakow?” I said, “We have no plans to stay here and obviously
                    this town is overfilled. There would be no accommodations.” She thought a moment
                    and said, “Why don't you come home with me?” She didn't know me. I said, “That's
                    extraordinary, very hospitable, but in fact, I'm not alone. It's not just my
                    wife and I. We're actually five people.” She thought about that a little while
                    and said, “That doesn't matter. You should all come home.” With that, the others
                    reappeared and I explained that we had all been invited to go home with her. We
                    went along with some misgivings. I said, “What will your husband say?” She said,
                    “Don't worry. He's just taking our son to camp right now and he'll be home this
                    evening and it will be alright with him.” I'll make a long story short. We're
                    all sitting around in the living room and by this time it's dusk and this is in
                    August, August 15. The husband comes home. We hear whispering at the door. I
                    said, “This is where we get our exit ticket.” This man, very tall, stood in the
                    doorway, looked down at us in the small living room and said, “Where there are
                    guests in the house, there also is God in the house.” That was it. He broke out
                    the vodka, we broke out the scotch, and she ran and got some tomatoes and onions
                    and made a little meal for us. We got very jolly. This was really irresponsible
                    of us. I finally said, “Look, it's so nice being with you and enjoying your
                    hospitality, but it's getting late and we really can't stay here tonight. It
                    would be too dangerous to you. We're not just American tourists. We're actually
                    from the embassy in Warsaw.” She said, “That makes no difference to us. Before
                    Gomulka, I wouldn't have dared speak to you in the street. Now, I'm not afraid.”
                    Here husband said the same thing. So, that night in their small house, they
                    cleared room for the five of us and in the evening we went up on the
                    mountainside with the pilgrims with all those candles, the processions, the
                    singing, hymns you never hear in the West. There are Polish hymns that are
                    hauntingly beautiful. I am not Catholic, but like the rest of the pilgrims when
                    that whole mountainside erupted in song, we just sank to our knees and cried. It
                    was so powerful. It almost epitomizes what Poland was all about during the two
                    years we were there. It made a lasting impression. Yet the other side of the
                    picture was a persistent, virulent, anti-Semitism that defies all logic.
                    Perfectly normal decent, warm human beings who would risk their lives for you,
                    show great courage and bravery, still had this ugly quirk. They would say,
                    “Everybody knows the American Congress is controlled by Jews and the American
                    media is controlled by them and the Jews are running the communist regime here.”
                    It's true that there were some Jews in the communist apparatus, but the truth
                    was, in Poland, there were very few Jews. They had been wiped out. That to me is
                    something I never squared in my own mind with these people, whom I loved and
                    admired in so many other ways, but I couldn't get over that.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>Q: I talked to one man who was in the 1970s in Poland. He said that as far as he
                    was concerned, there probably were two or three dedicated communists in the
                    entire country and there wasn't much real belief in communism.</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Quite right. There was opportunism. There was no Walter Ulbricht in
                    Poland. These people came to terms with a superior power and one they had lived
                    with on their borders for 1,000 years. So, they made do. There was an inner
                    resistance, a psychological resistance. Of course, the role of the Church during
                    those years was incredible. The churches were filled to overflowing at every
                    Masand with young people, not just the elderly. There has been a lot written
                    about this. The Church was a powerful political force. Now in the last 10 years,
                    things look different. But in those years, to be Polish was to be Catholic, to
                    be Catholic was to be Polish. It was indivisible. Of course, the Ukrainians and
                    the White Russians had all gone. Stalin took the eastern half of Poland. The
                    Jews had been exterminated and the Germans had been driven out of the west. So,
                    what was left in the rump Polish state after Yalta was 98% ethnically Polish and
                    catholic.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find any reflection of cynicism about Marxist Leninism? I was serving
                    at about the same time in Yugoslavia. There were courses in Marxist Leninist
                    this and newspapers. They were just filled with gobbledygook of communist
                    rhetoric. Was this going on then?</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Of course, the government, the official organs, were going overtime on
                    it, but absolutely nobody took any of this seriously. Cynicism is no word for
                    it. It was just an understanding that the regime said one thing but nobody
                    believed it. There was a naive faith in America. America was still the fabled
                    land. You would drive out in the country in an embassy car or your own personal
                    car and you'd get stopped. Peasants would gather around. “Are you from America?”
                    “Yes, we are.” “You must know my cousin. He's in Buffalo.” This sort of thing.
                    Any American space triumph or other success, the Poles were jubilant over it.
                    The pro-American sympathy was just extraordinary.</p>
                <p>Q: In the Consular Section, you must have run across the fact that Chicago has
                    more Poles in_ Chicago is the second largest Polish city in the world next to
                    Warsaw. Were you running into reflections of the Polish-American_</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: Overwhelming. The immigrant rolls had been reopened. That was part of
                    the liberalization. We dusted off the old registration books from the early
                    1950s. People had been registered in 1951, 1952, and here you are in the 1960s
                    and you're processing them. There was a lot of validation that had to be done.
                    Were the people who signed then really the same people? The waiting room was
                    something to see, especially in the winter. The trains would come in from all
                    over Poland during the night and by 6:00 am the crowd in front of the Consular
                    Section was enormous. Usually, somebody would come down early and let them come
                    in out of the cold. Then as they streamed into that huge waiting room, our
                    clerks would go and man the desk. The other thing that happened was, as the
                    temperature rose, they wore those great big, hairy sheepskin coats and then the
                    fleas started to pop out. So, you had fleas jumping all over the place. The
                    memories that come back of that. And then interviewing these people. It was a
                    chance to use my FSI Polish, but you quickly found out that that Polish and the
                    Polish these peasants spoke were some distance apart. I enjoyed it. I enjoyed
                    using the language. Again, you had a sense of helping people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about communist oriented organizations? I assume
                        there waa Polish Communist Youth.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: For those, it was just routine, pro forma membership. It was not a bar
                    to immigration. But yes, there were a lot of sticky cases that came up,
                    especially if there was something on file that somebody had denounced somebody.
                    I tried to get at the root of that. I had more than one run-in with the
                    Department in which there was security information that hadn't been clarified in
                    which a visa was denied. I would appeal it and marshal as much evidence as I
                    could. That could take a disproportionate amount of time. There was a mindset
                    back in Washington that “When in doubt, keep them out.” These things you had to
                    deal with very seriously. I got a lot of satisfaction out of that, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were the denunciations coming from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: You didn't know. The information was classified. You couldn't confront
                    the potential immigrant with the source. It required a lot of resourceful work,
                    getting testimonials and evidence to the contrarhow do you get evidence to the
                    contrary if you don't know what you're_</p>
                <p>Q: I would think you'd be running into more trouble when you started_ The normal
                    peasant had no problem. But when you're getting into what would be the
                    professional class_</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: Exactly. That is where the problem came. These were people who were in
                    many other ways the most qualified and would make the best new citizens. There
                    were Poles who went to the U.S. after I fought one of these battles back and
                    forth with the Department and for years afterwards, I would get Christmas cards
                    in which they would tell me what they were doing, how they had prospered, how
                    their sons were now going to American colleges. It's storybook stuff. Just
                    wonderful. So, people would often say, “God, you're still doing consular work?
                    That's not career advancing.” But it was personally very, very satisfying.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is my field.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: This was before the days of consular cones. So, there was a widespread
                    sense that if you wanted to earn your ticket to doing political or economic
                    work, then you had to do consular work. That often resulted in what you
                    described before as cynicism. I was on the Board of Examiners when we had the
                    consular cone introduced. It was much better.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have problems with people who might have been
                        tainted or were suspected of war crimes during WWII?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: I cannot remember a single case. I won't say there could not have been
                    anybody, but, no, that was not a real issue at the consulate in Warsaw. For the
                    non-immigrants, it would be bona fides. How do you establish that they really
                    will come back? For the immigrants, it was more to whom were they going and
                    would we be sure they wouldn't become a public charge. Once again, those refugee
                    organizations with which I had worked in Vienna were active in Poland, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you doing any political reporting on the side?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: Very little. Jake Beam sent me up to Gdansk when the first shipment of
                    PL-480 grain arrived in a huge tanker. The military attaches swarmed all over
                    me. I would be going to an area that was militarily out of bounds. They wanted
                    me to observe things in the harbor and this, that, and the other thing. The
                    harbor was sensitive and out of bounds. When I arrived, there was a launch
                    flying an American flag waiting to take me on a tour of the harbor. There was a
                    great to-do made about the shipment. The grain was very important for Poland at
                    that time. During my time there, a huge mountain of zlotys managed to pile up.
                    They paid for the grain in local currency. So, that was one example. Another
                    time I drove my parents to Auschwitz. Sheila was expecting our third child at
                    the time and couldn't travel. On the way back, we ran into Warsaw Pact
                    maneuvers. This was in September. I remember saying to my father, “I want you to
                    jot down the license numbers.” Tanks were going by. Everything was on the move.
                    My father got so excited. His son, the spy. It was not really spying. We were
                    going along and he was on his second pad of paper. I said, “You know, Dad, if we
                    get stopped, you'll have to swallow this.” I got back and turned this all over
                    to the Army attach� and he said anytime I wanted to change careers, he could get
                    me a job in military intelligence. (not likely) But those things were really few
                    and far between. All the time we were doing things that had a political
                    significance and those things would be reported. But we were seven of us in the
                    Consular Section, including doing citizenship work. There were six in the
                    reporting sections. We called ourselves the “Outer Seven.” At that time, the EC
                    had the Inner Six and the Outer Seven. There was a certain amount of pride among
                    the seven of us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was your supervisor and what was his or her

                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: The head of the Consular Section when I arrived was Francis T.
                    Underhill, just a marvelous human being with a wonderful wife who was a great
                    Foreign Service mother. I forget where Francis had been, but most of his career
                    had been spent in Asia. He finished as ambassador to Malaysia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He just died a month or two ago.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: We remained very close friends. In fact, I was calling to arrange our
                    next get-together (They would come up and visit us every second year or we would
                    go down and see them in North Carolina) and Francis had just died that morning.
                    He was a great human being, one of the finest drafting officers I ever
                    encountered. His ability with the English language_ in retirement down in North
                    Carolina, among other things, he continued to write a column for a local
                    newspaper. I have saved many of those columns. They were all done with wit and
                    erudition and good judgement and good instinct. John Davis succeeded him. John
                    went on to make a great name for himself as ambassador to Poland. We have also
                    remained very close. It's interesting the bonds you form in those early years in
                    the Foreign Service. They can be really strong and lasting.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>It was a good section. Morale was very high. We felt that what wwere doing was
                    very important. It was fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said that about halfway through this 1960-1962 period,
                        thGomulka period ended and the secret service started.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: They began to crack down again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were we reading that and how did it affect the embassy
                        work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: The most dramatic evidence of it was that your Polish friends started
                    falling off. You would get a phone call the day of the dinner part“We can't
                    come.” You were being tailed. The surveillance was a lot more intrusive and
                    obvious. Wives were jostled in the markets. Art Olsen of “The New York Times”
                    had his home burglarized while he was away. Also, the tapping of your phones.
                    Everything was more obvious. That contributed to a certain dampening. But the
                    work went on. You did the best you could. The Poles remained more courageous
                    than ever, the risks they would take in the face of this kind of
                    intimidation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you picking up the fortunes of the great
                        Soviet-Polisfriendship?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Oh, come on! The hatred and fear of the Soviets was the hatred and fear
                    of the Russians which was hatred and fear that was 1,000 years old. This was
                    tribal. This was so deep in the Polish soul. There was no fooling about it. Here
                    was this poor country with no natural borders. To the east, they have the mighty
                    Russian bear. To the west, they have the Germans. The fear inbred was equal,
                    except that to the east it was tinged with a sense of superiority, “We the Poles
                    are the superior people to these miserable Russians,” and the west it was the
                    almighty Teutons, their cultural superiority.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you picking up through the embassy through the Inner Six and other
                    colleagues a feeling about whither Poland at this time? Was Poland looked upon
                    as a solid member militarily of the Warsaw Pact?</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: We would read the analyses of the entire Warsaw Pact, how reliable they
                    were. Every time the Pentagon did a Sandkastenspiel, this would be factored in.
                    But the truth is, in terms of the whole structure of the Warsaw Pact, there
                    wasn't much that was changing and there wasn't much leeway. Whether or not the
                    Polish army would remain loyal .You could give various scenarios of
                    circumstances. But in the end, that was not a make or break factor. It was one
                    of these things that was of interest, but nobody really thought that the Polish
                    army would make the difference. If the stakes were high, the Soviets would do it
                    themselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you work with the case of Scarbeck? How did that
                        affect yoall?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Scarbeck, we all knew him well. He was general services officer. His
                    wife was German-born, a very nice lady. They seemed to be a devoted couple, so
                    when the spy case broke, it was like a thunderclap. He had gone out to
                    Frankfurt. The Polish secret police caught him in a compromising situation. She
                    had been forced to work for them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had a girlfriend.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: He had a girlfriend, yes. She didn't work for the embassy, but she
                    certainly worked for them. He was caught and they had incriminating evidence on
                    him. The stuff he actually gave to them when we reviewed it all, in hindsight,
                    was nothing that made any difference. Jake Beam at one point saiI think it was
                    his wrap-up of his years in Polan“I wish this was something the Poles could
                    read,” never thinking that they would, thanks to Scarbeck. Then came the trial
                    back here. The embassy was emptied out. The ambassador, the DCM, the whole Inner
                    Six. There were two of us left at post one weekend. The other officer was Jack
                    Scanlan, who also went on to a very long and illustrious career in Poland and
                    elsewhere in Eastern Europe and Yugoslavia. Jack said, “We'll, you're an 0-7 and
                    I'm an 0-6, so I'm the charge.” The case was stunning, but really had no impact
                    on morale.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there concerns as you traveled around about the Polish
                        secrepolice trying to compromise people? Did you have to travel in
                        pairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: We did travel in pairs. No effort was ever made that I knew of to
                    compromise me. I went off with Jack Scanlan on a memorable trip to get out and
                    see something. We arrived in Rzeszow in southeastern Poland. Jack was more
                    experienced. He had already had a tour in the Soviet Union. I was appalled at
                    what a wretched, shabby town this was. I remember going into this miserable
                    hotel and commenting to Jack how awful everything was. He said, “Bill, you don't
                    know what you're talking about. If you took a train in Moscow and loaded it up
                    with ordinary Soviet citizens and it was a closed train and you drove them
                    through the night and you opened the doors here in Rzeszow, they'd all think
                    they were in Paris.” That may have been a slight exaggeration, but it showed
                    that all things are relative. The Polish standard of living was higher than the
                    Russian standard of living. But, no, other than phones being tapped, obvious
                    surveillance, there was nothing more dangerous than that. Nobody got really
                    roughed up.</p>
                <p>Q: You were a collegial group. Were there any intellectual activities going on,
                    plays, newspapers, poetry that showed a sign of non-conformity?</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Oh, yes. Almost all of it had an undercurrent that was very subtle. In
                    any country in which there is censorship and suppression, creative people find
                    ingenious ways and subtle ways to get the message through and the Poles were
                    particularly good at that. That was true in books, poetry_ there was a very
                    lively cultural life in Poland. Considering the Nazi slaughter and the Soviet
                    slaughter of the elites in Poland, it was amazing there here in the '60s so much
                    of it was reviving. Movies, for instance.</p>
                <p>Q: In 1962, you had had your Austrian and Polish experience. What happened
                    then?</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: The second half of the language and area studies kicked in and I was
                    sent home to Columbia University to the Eastern European Department. The idea
                    was that I would do a paper under Brzezinski. That is what I had asked for.
                    Unfortunately, that was the year that he took a sabbatical and wasn't active at
                    Columbia. But it was kind of fun being back at university, although when you're
                    married and have three kids and a commute from the suburbs, it's all very
                    different from being single, footloose, and fancy free. But I took it all
                    seriously. I did an honors paper on Poland. It was on the role of the Church.
                    But it really was in fulfillment of the fact that this was part of language AND
                    area studies. It was a little bit crazy having it afterwards. The truth is, for
                    all that investment in me as an Eastern European specialist, I never went back
                    to Eastern Europe or the Soviet Union. My next assignment was Berlin and that

                <p>Q: While you were in Poland, you were considerably removed, but the election of
                    1960 and Kennedy coming in_ It roused a certain amount of excitement in some
                    people about government service. Did this have any reflection on you or were you
                    too far removed?</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: There was a lot of excitement among Poles. The first Catholic
                    President. In the campaign, I was agonizing over how I would vote. Shame, shame,
                    in the end, I didn't vote. We had very good relations with all the staff. It was
                    a large staff, maybe 14 or so people in that outer office. One lady asked me
                    about the election and how would I vote? I said, “As a matter of fact, I hate to
                    tell you this, but I've decided I'm not going to vote.” She was thunderstruck.
                    “You mean you don't have to vote?” That is what struck her, that here was a
                    government employee and he didn't have to vote. But the Kennedy administration,
                    there was a lot of excitement. There is no question. I got the full impact. He
                    was inaugurated in January and I was home by that summer. Then we had the Cuban
                    Missile Crisis in the fall while I was attending classes at Columbia. I arrived
                    in Berlin ten days before he did. Then I was in Berlin when he was
                    assassinated.</p>
                <p>I was very happy doing what I was doing. It never crossed my mind that I had made
                    a career mistake or that it was anything other than immensely rewarding.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: They came to visit us in Vienna, less to see their son the vice consul
                    than to see their first grandchild. They also came to visit us in Poland. I
                    think they were there with us for five weeks. I guess they were proud of me, but
                    these were parents who were always proud of anything I did, so it was nothing
                    new. I basked in parental approval. By then, we had three children. My wife had
                    to fly out to Scotland to have the baby because the hospitals in Warsaw were so
                    bad. A wife of one Foreign Service officer, USIA, had a terrible experience
                    giving birth to a child and the child was damaged. So, from that point on, it
                    was Peggy Beam who stepped in and said, “Any more babies due here must be
                    delivered in the West.” Most of the wives went out to the hospital in
                    Frankfurt.</p>

                <p>WOESSNER: I can't remember. Unlike when you're an undergraduate and you're on

                    graduate school, you had a very full workload, a long commute, and a family at
                    home. As soon as I could get away from campus, I would go. So, I was not
                    involved in the unrest at Columbia.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: I don't know. It was my understanding that after two overseas tours, I
                    would go to Washington when I finished at Columbia. I got a call from Personnel,
                    who said they wanted to assign me to Berlin. I was stunned. I took some
                    soundings then from people who knew and everybody said what a wonderful,
                    exciting, and interesting city Berlin was and how good the housing there was,
                    which was important for a family person. On the other hand, I was warned against
                    the man I would be working for. I weighed the pros and cons and said, “I would
                    really like to go.” It was to the Eastern Affairs Section. That is where the
                    Eastern European studies came into play. But what that Eastern Affairs Section
                    really did had little to do with Eastern Europe, as such. It had to do with the
                    GDR. You followed what was going on on the other side of the wall. In the
                    exercise of Four Power rights, you had free access to circulate in East
                    Berlin.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: I arrived in June of 1963, ten days before Kennedy came. My tour was
                    extended twice. It was a three-year tour, but I was there until November
                    1967.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about the atmosphere of Berlin when you arrived
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Mind blowing. We sailed to Bremerhaven. We picked up our car there and
                    drove up the autobahn into Berlin. That was our introduction to the city. We
                    experienced all of the red tape that goes with that, the excitement of traveling
                    on the autobahn, and then arriving in this great metropolis surrounded by a
                    wall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The wall had been put up when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Two years earlier, in August of 1961. In those days, you were housed at
                    Harnack House, the military officers club. The Army ran so much because the city
                    was still occupied. I reported for duty and “Oh, Woessner, hi. Welcome. Go away
                    and do something for ten days. We've got the President coming.” They could in no
                    way be bothered. The place was in a stir. So, we were there when Kennedy
                    appeared at the Rathaus and gave his famous “Ich bin ein Berliner” speech and
                    all the rest.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>The atmosphere was pretty heady. As you know, there was this incredible turnout
                    of Berliners that far exceeded the White House's expectation. The President was
                    not particularly sympathetic to the Germans or to the Berliners. He didn't have
                    a good relationship with Adenauer. His closest advisors generally tended to
                    favor a deal with the Russians. That is what really counted. Berlin was a stone
                    around the neck. It was a place where anytime the Russians wanted to apply
                    pressure on us, they could. It was more liability. That was the mentality
                    leading up to this. That trip more than any single event turned John F. Kennedy
                    around. He didn't plan to say the things he said. It was a momentous day.</p>
                <p>Q: Someone I interviewed who was there before that time and maybe including that
                    time was saying that when the Kennedy administration came in, they were very
                    nervous. They felt that the group around Kennedy and Kennedy himself weren't
                    sound on Berlin.</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Oh, they certainly were not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The feeling was that “We have reached stability. These
                        Kennedtypes may sell us out.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Had the Soviets played it more shrewdly or not overplayed their hand,
                    there were times when a deal could have been struck at the expense of Berlin.
                    After June 1961, the American commitment to Berlin was rock solid.</p>
                <p>Q: What were you doing while you were waiting? Were you able to get out and see
                    Berlin?</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: A little bit of that. You get settled in. I don't remember too much
                    except that I was anxious to get in the office and get started.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your job was what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: It was political reporting. There was a Political Section there that
                    dealt with access questions to Berlin and the politics of West Berlin, the
                    relationship with the mayor and Bonn. The Eastern Affairs was supposed to
                    concentrate on the politics and economics of the GDR. We were pursuing a policy
                    at that time of denial of recognition to the GDR. Together with the British and
                    the French we maintained something called the Allied Travel Office. Any East
                    German citizens wanting to go to any NATO countries had to have a special pass
                    from the Allied Travel Office. It was in support of the West German policy, the
                    Hallstein Doctrine, which denied diplomatic recognition to any nations who gave
                    recognition to the GDR. This was still a period of great rivalry between East
                    and West. My first summer there was the summer that Egon Bahr made the speech at
                    Tutzing Academy entitle“Coming Closer Together through Rapprochement.” He
                    enunciated a policy of small steps. This became Willy Brandt's policy and
                    gradually changed the relationship between the two German states. There was
                    still a lot of jockeying for position but it was the beginning of the
                    change.</p>
                <p>I also was aware of and sometimes involved in the trade in human beings. This was
                    followed primarily by intelligence agencies and CIA, but the Evangelical Church
                    was one of the main conduits for the money. The West German government paid
                    money to the East German government through the church and then the East German
                    government would release the prisoners. One of the things that I took on that
                    nobody had done before was the role of the church in Berlin. My boss, the head
                    of the section, had me to lunch the second day I was there. He asked what I had
                    done at Columbia and I told him about the paper I had done on the Polish church.
                    He said, “Oh, you're just the person. How would you like to follow the role of
                    the church here?” I said, “Oh, I'm not exactly an ecclesiastical attach� type.”
                    He said, “Never mind.” I'm so glad he did because it was one of the most
                    fascinating aspects of my time there. The church was highly political. It was
                    very much attuned to what was going on both East and West. I went and visited
                    churchmen in East Berlin and talked to them and got a lot of useful
                    information.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say “church,” what are you talking about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: The Evangelical Lutheran Church. Before the war, Berlin was probably
                    90% Lutheran. There was a Catholic Church, St. Hedwig's Cathedral in East
                    Berlin. A very courageous cardinal was in charge over there. But politically,
                    they never had the heft that the Evangelical Church did. They were not really
                    involved in such things as the prisoner release program.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>A particularly exciting event was the visit of Martin Luther King to Berlin. He
                    preached in the West and then he went to the East to preach. By this time, I had
                    very good contacts in the church and elsewhere. He got to Checkpoint Charlie and
                    he had forgotten his passport and they let him go through anyway. He went to the
                    church in the center of Berlin that had been the main church of the bishop, who
                    had been banned by the East Germans from coming over to hold services there. The
                    church was overflowing. They were crowded outside. As he was fighting his way
                    through the crowd, I managed to say to him, “Dr. King, you see the size of this
                    crowd. There is another church about six blocks from here and that is also
                    filling up because word has gone out that you're going to go over there. Is
                    there some way you could do that?” He did. He gave a sermon and they smuggled me
                    in the back so I was hiding behind the altar. There was no room in the church.
                    He used biblical allusions, walls coming down, walls separate people. It was a
                    powerful service and was well received.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was translated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Yes. The choir sang Negro spirituals. Then sure enough, when he left
                    the church there, he went on across town and spoke at the other church. The
                    regime didn't dare try to stop him. They had even let him come through
                    Checkpoint Charlie when they had perfectly good grounds for stopping him. That
                    was one of the highlights of my tour in Berlin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the East German church?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: First a sidebar on Lutheran theology—on the concept of Obrigkeit—on the
                    church's attitude toward civil authority. From the time of Martin Luther, the
                    church subscribed to the view that it had its own responsibilities which were
                    spiritual, but that on political matters it did not defy the civil authorities.
                    This led to a great crisis of conscience during the Nazi period when some
                    pastors did defy the Nazis and went to concentration camps, even death, while
                    others were silent and went along. Something similar recurred in the GDR,
                    although the regime was certainly nowhere as totalitarian or as criminal as the
                    Nazi regime. Pastors were not hauled off, tortured, and killed. Still, it took a
                    fair bit of political courage to stand up to the regime. The church encompassed
                    the whole gamut from those who stood up to the regime to those who were active
                    collaborators. The church in the early years was still the only unified
                    organization left in greater Germany. The Evangelical Lutheran Church was both
                    West and East and the political and ecclesiastical boundaries overlapped. Then
                    the DDR split it finally and irrevocably so that the church in the East became
                    self-governing and had its own governing council. That was a tough one to
                    counter. Church membership went way down. Unlike the Catholics in Berlin, the
                    Lutherans were much more nominally Christian. When the pressure was put on, they
                    fell away from the church in droves so that attendance at service went way down.
                    But then again, those who stayed were probably more committed than any had been
                    before the war. The churches became vehicles for inner resistance. For those
                    Lutherans who rediscovered their faith, it became a very deep, meaningful
                    experience. I would estimate that maybe 10% of Lutherans were active in the
                    church during these years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of compare and contrast between
                        the GDand Poland?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: In Poland there was this tremendous national unity, a great, deep
                    patriotism which was also bound up in the church. Being Polish was being
                    Catholic; being Catholic was being Polish. There was an intense resistance to
                    alien rule because there was no doubt in the minds of the people that their
                    government was propped up by a foreign power that they found odious. In the GDR,
                    the regime was also propped up by an odious foreign power, but its military
                    presence was very real. Red Army divisions were stationed throughout the
                    country. Furthermore, the sense of national identity was very confused by the
                    existence of a more powerful, more prosperous West Germany whose cultural
                    influences being felt all the time. 85% of the GDR could pick up Western
                    broadcasts. That made for a very different dynamic. There was the yearning for
                    reunification. Over time, and even after the wall came down, a certain subset
                    identity developed that was a GDR thin“We East Germans did what we did despite
                    the fact that the Soviets carted off all our productive capacity. We lived with
                    these reparations for year and years. We had an oppressive alien regime. And yet
                    we survived and we're proud of what we did.” So, in that sense, it was a mixture
                    of wanting to be reunited with the fellow Germans in the West and also resenting
                    the prosperity of the West. The full impact of this didn't really manifest
                    itself until after the wall came down and the discrepancy appeared.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the head of East Germany during this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Walter Ulbricht the whole time I was there. What I didn't realize then
                    (I don't think any of us did, but it came out subsequently), was the extent to
                    which he influenced Soviet policy in ways that the Kremlin didn't really want.
                    Ulbricht always put his own power and the stability of his regime before
                    everything else. He almost had the Soviets as hostage to that. Ulbricht was the
                    unquestioned leader. I remember going over to a big rally one summer in Karl
                    Marx Platz. Ulbricht would give five-hour speeches with a high, squeaky voice,
                    and a Saxon accent that other Germans found so amusing. That particular day
                    because of the heat, soldiers were keeling over and he had to cut the speech
                    short. But the next day, the party newspaper carried the full text of the speech
                    and some sections that he had never delivered carried the parenthetical notation
                    “long tumultuous applause.”</p>
                <p>Q: After your experience in Poland, were you looking for manifestations within
                    the people you would talk to in East Germany as far as rolling their eyes as far
                    as the standard communist line was or was it a different world?</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Somewhat different in that the Germans were not as subtle or as clever
                    in making fun of their rulers. There was some of it. There was a cabaret in East
                    Berlin that went pretty far, but it wasn't a particularly German phenomenon in
                    the way it was a universal Polish phenomenon. For instance, I remember walking
                    on the streets in East Berlin. I was in a section that wasn't very crowded and
                    out of nowhere a woman came up to me. Clearly, from the way I was dressed, she
                    knew I was from the West. She just said, “Don't forget us,” and scurried off.
                    And when I would find myself in a small, intimate group with church leaders or
                    intellectuals, or young students, yes, they knew they were in a tight situation
                    and looked to the West. It was terribly important that we were in West Berlin,
                    almost as important to them as it was to the West Berliners.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there constant incidents at the wall, escaping?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Oh, yes, this whole period was one of ever tightening restrictions,
                    more minefields, more barbed wire. Every escape would lead to further tightening
                    up until finally it became very difficult for anybody to get out. Prior to my
                    arrival, you had the infamous case of the young man who was shot down at the
                    Wall and lay bleeding to death in the death strip and the West didn't did
                    nothing and he bled to death there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the head of our mission in Berlin?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: When I got there, it was Arch Calhoun. He was the minister. The
                    minister reported to the ambassador in Bonn and then through the ambassador to
                    Washington. We also had a two-star commandant who was technically the supreme
                    authority in West Berlin but the minister had a determining role in the politics
                    of it all. So, you also had two chains of command, one that went to the Pentagon
                    and one that went to the State Department. You also had some rivalry between the
                    leadership in Berlin and the leadership in Bonn. Arch Calhoun had been an
                    ambassador and would be ambassador again. He was a career officer with a lot of
                    self-esteem and strong leadership qualities. There was no question in his mind
                    who called the tune in Berlin or who made the recommendations to Washington. The
                    ambassador in Bonn was George McGhee at that time.</p>
                <p>Those power relationships evolved over time. Years later, I had a chance to view
                    it all from the embassy. There was a rivalry between the embassy and the mission
                    and whose recommendations would prevail. There was absolutely nothing that
                    happened in Berlin that was not subjected to intense scrutiny in both capitals,
                    Washington and Moscow. The idea that Berlin was somehow a tinderbox couldn't
                    have been further from the truth. The chances of an accidental conflagration
                    there were nil. Everything was controlled. There was also the whole business of
                    Berlinery, for example, the British, the French, the Americans all had different
                    rules as to how high the tailgates should be on the trucks going in and out and
                    who submitted to which inspection when. The East Germans were always probing,
                    looking for ways to expose differences among the allies. The way in which the
                    allies would go their own ways on small things and then come together on big
                    things was fascinating. So, you had this constant interplay. On the broad
                    scheme, it would be Moscow and Washington and then Moscow and the three Allies
                    and then below that you had the two German states and their relationship or no
                    relationship to one another and their relationship to their respective
                    patrons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In so many other international things, the French seem to
                        be odman out. How about here?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: I think that was also true in Berlin. I never served in France. My
                    experience has always been in the Four-Power context. But yes, the French were
                    generally the odd man out. Their relationship towards Germany was quite clear.
                    They certainly never wanted to see a unified Germany, make no mistake about
                    that. They wanted a Germany that was as closely allied to France as could be.
                    Thanks to Schuman and Adenauer, great things were achieved in Western Europe.
                    Adenauer was determined that West Germany would be so intricately enmeshed in a
                    Western alliance that it could never break loose again even if it wanted to.
                    That was his lasting contribution. By the time Germany was reunified, which
                    nobody expected then, you wouldn't be able to play the Bismarck game of going
                    East and going West. French attitudes showed up in such things as occupation
                    costs. We were scrupulous about what we asked the Germans to pay for and what we
                    paid for. The French made no bones about making the Germans pay for absolutely
                    everything.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>Q: I was just interviewing John Buche yesterday and he was saying how the French
                    would run their troops through Berlin in order to get them reequipped. We had a
                    pretty good deal with cars, where we would have cars that supposedly the Germans
                    would get for Berlin but they would show up (and the Germans knew about it) at
                    all our posts.</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: But in the Federal Republic?</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Somehow or another, they would originate in Berlin

                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: You would have to say that on the really big issues (Kennedy and Cuba),
                    when the chips were down, the French were first and foremost standing with us.
                    But on so many other things, De Gaulle was getting even for all those years of
                    humiliation by Churchill and Roosevelt.</p>
                <p>Q: During the Berlin airlift, there was a tower that everybody was afraid to
                    touch because it was difficult for our airplanes and the French went in and blew
                    it up. As Churchill said, “Of all the crosses I had to bear, the cross of
                    Lorraine was the heaviest.” Was there concern at this time that something could
                    happen, that one of the powers might do something which would give the East
                    Germans and thereby the Sovietweaken our position in Berlin or were things
                    pretty solid?</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: If I had to characterize these years, the years of greatest uncertainty
                    were behind us and things did start to stabilize and the East-West equation
                    stabilized. The activity moved much more to the German-German sphere. The West
                    Germans were ingenious in finding ways to get money to the East Germans. There
                    were some misgivings in the West at the time. It was more than just paying for
                    prisoners, but all kinds of things. There were so-called “interzonal trade” and
                    swing credits. They allowed the East Germans to build up an ever bigger deficit.
                    There was a willingness to carry them. It was ultimately successful because it
                    did undermine the East. For instance, opening up the Wall prior to the Four
                    Power Agreement and the GDR-FRG treaty made it a lot easier for West Germans and
                    West Berliners to go to East Germany and every one of them had to pay, so huge
                    sums of money went into the coffers. But that constant exposure to the West, not
                    just via TV and radio, but by visits from relatives and also building up this
                    big trade deficit, in the end, all of those things came together and so weakened
                    the GDR that it became a liability to Gorbachev and one of the factors leading
                    to the dissolution of the empire.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>Q: One of the concerns was that something could happen and all of a sudden there
                    would be real mass uprising of the people in East Germany and that would not be
                    tolerable as far as West Germans would be concerned and there might be a flowing
                    in which would cause the Soviet army to massively intervene and that's World War
                    III.</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: I don't think so. Yes, there was that shadow because of what happened
                    in 1953 when the workers took to the streets, that that could happen again. So,
                    the mood in the East was monitored, but I don't recall at any point that we
                    thought that sort of instability or uprising was imminent. Again, the West
                    German policy of pumping money into the East ameliorated an awful lot. Also,
                    letting the most seriously discontented people out, letting them be bought out,
                    so many thousands of prisoners every year, that combination of letting off steam
                    that way and ameliorating the circumstances in which people lived. I would say
                    there was a general discontent and a general alienation but it was never acute
                    and never brought us to the brink of war. Also, all the interactions were so
                    minutely monitored in both the Kremlin and the West that there was little chance
                    for a mistake or something small that could escalate to something big. There
                    were tense moments when the West German Bundestag convened in plenary session in
                    Berlin, Soviet MIGs roared over the city with sonic booms as a way of expressing
                    their displeasure. But eventually as part of the bigger German-German accord,
                    those plenary sessions were discontinued. There was tension over the air
                    cargoes. When the Soviets wanted to apply pressure, they would order us to cease
                    and desist from flying above a certain altitude. The MIGs would buzz our planes
                    coming up the corridor. It could have led to something nasty, but it never did.
                    Both sides refrained from anything that could have been dangerous. In the end,
                    again, as part of the Four-Power Agreement, we agreed to a 10,000- foot ceiling
                    so that if you were flying from Munich or Frankfurt, you'd enter the corridor
                    and drop down to 10,000 feet. Part of that related to intelligence
                    gathering.</p>

                    extensively in East Berlin, met with people over there. One of the things I most
                    enjoyed doing was taking visitors over. I gave historical tours and
                    ecclesiastical tours and political tours. I even had a 1901 Baedecker that I
                    could refer to from time to time. It was great fun.</p>

                <p>WOESSNER: Yes, we went to that frequently, to the operetta even more, which was a
                    higher quality. Felsenstein was recognized as a real genius. He lived in the
                    West but was heavily subsidized in the East. There were American opera stars who
                    sang at the Comic Opera and at the National Opera.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Yes, there was a lot of that.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you get a feel while you were in East Germany and looking at the goods
                    that were coming out_ Having been in Poland, there was a great deal of playing
                    up, “Well, the East Germans are still Germans and they really can produce
                    stuff.” After Germany got united, most of the East German stuff was third
                    rate.</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: There was no question that the appearance of prosperity in East Berlin
                    and for people who went to the Leipzig Fair was much greater. The standard of
                    living, what people ate and what they had, was much higher in the GDR than in
                    Poland. The extent to which bad management of manufacturing processes,
                    pollution, and all the rest had really eviscerated the German economy, that was
                    largely missed by Western experts. We constantly were reading intelligence
                    evaluations that this was the 10th manufacturing country in the world. The truth
                    is that their goods were inferior and vulnerable to competition from the West.
                    After the Wall came down, the real weakness of the economy showed through. But
                    they were very successful in the propaganda they generated. It was that very
                    weakness that persuaded Gorbachev, given the Soviet Union's own weakness, that
                    he could no longer sustain this country.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for the Soviet military in East

                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: That was beyond my scope since they were not in East Berlin. There was
                    a deliberate withdrawal beyond the city, by which they tried to substantiate the
                    notion that this was the capital of the GDR. During those years at least, the
                    Soviets were kept very close to barracks. That eased up somewhat later on. Then
                    when the Wall came down and before they withdrew, there was a total lack of
                    discipline. There was chaos and all kinds of bad things. One of Lucius Clay's
                    great achievements had been to force the Russians to show their hands at
                    Checkpoint Charlie and when the tanks rolled up and we rolled ours up, it was
                    clear they couldn't trust the East Germans. But that was all before my time.</p>

                <p>WOESSNER: No. There were some spectacular escapes and some defections, but these
                    were all isolated. One of the most interesting escapes, by the way, involved the
                    future columnist George Will. One Sunday afternoon, I got a call at home. I was
                    the duty officer for that weekend. A man said he'd like to come by and talk to
                    me, that he needed some advice. He introduced himself. He was George Will,
                    relatively young and not yet well known. He said he was planning to go into East
                    Berlin and bring somebody out and what did I think of the idea? I said, “Well,
                    it is becoming increasingly hazardous.” I had to warn him in all seriousness
                    that he should not do it. But I realized I didn't have the authority to stop him
                    either. We chatted for a while and he listened. He said, “I tell you what I'll
                    do. I'll at least let you know what I decide to do.” A couple of days later, I
                    got a phone call from Templehof Airport where he was getting ready to fly out.
                    He said, “I just want you to know that I went in and got her out.” A couple of
                    years later, while I was at an FSI retreat here in Washington, I got a phone
                    call. A voice said, “You won't remember me, but this is George Will.” I said,
                    “Of course I remember you.” He said, “I'm thinking of going back to visit Berlin
                    and what do you think if I went to the East? I'm not planning to bring anybody
                    out. I know I didn't follow your advice last time, but I would value what you
                    think.” I said, “Look, they didn't stop you last time. They didn't catch you.
                    But I can't believe they don't know that you did it. Their intelligence is very
                    good and everything leaks like a sieve. They keep lists and depending upon the
                    overall political climate, they could or could not arrest you and make an
                    example of you. It could be unpleasant. Unless you have some compelling reason
                    to go, I think it's too risky.” He said, “You know, I think you're right. I
                    won't go.” That was George F. Will.</p>

                <p>WOESSNER: I came home. I had been lined up for a job a year and half in advance.

                <p>You came back from where?</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: From Berlin, in November of 1967.</p>

                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: I was assigned to the Office of Soviet and East European Exchanges. The
                    head of the department was Boris Klossen. The deputy was Art Wortzel. Art had
                    recruited me for this job. The problem was that at the point that I came home,
                    U.S.-Soviet relations had gone into one of the bleakest phases of the Cold War.
                    Everything was frozen, but especially the exchanges. In that sense, there was no
                    job. I had the assignment; I moved into the office. But there was very little
                    going on.</p>

                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: Altogether seven months. I need to explain that when I spent an
                    abbreviated home leave with my parents in New York City and then reported to
                    Washington, a lot of things came together. We left Berlin on a high. It had been
                    an enormously satisfying and happy assignment. Our two youngest children were
                    born there. I mentioned that the Soviets buzzed the city the day we picked up an
                    honorary Berlin birth certificate for one of them. We had a wonderful home. The
                    two youngest children were sent on ahead with a friend to stay with my parents.
                    We came with the three other children. It was the last crossing of the USS
                    Independence. It was taken out of service after that. We got home and within
                    three days, I had to take my father to the doctor for pains in his stomach. It
                    turned out it was cancer and he in fact died within two months. That was totally
                    unexpected and devastating. At the same time, my wife was diagnosed with a
                    breast lump and had to go for a biopsy. Fortunately, it was benign, but that was
                    the first shadow of that kind that came over us. In the midst of this family
                    stress, we moved with the five children to Washington. For the first time in my
                    life, I had the pleasure of buying a house. I had to go into debt to do it and I
                    don't take kindly to debt. I hadn't learned how to be a good American yet. The
                    combination of all these things - we moved into the new house just weeks before
                    my father actually died - triggered health problems for me, which I understand
                    in retrospect is not unusual. But most significantly, I was stricken with what
                    was then diagnosed as ankylosing spondylitis, a form of spinal arthritis, which
                    meant in effect I couldn't walk. My ankles, knees, and hips were all affected. I
                    got around with great difficulty using two canes. There I was, in a non-job. It
                    was a major turning point. You bounce back and keep on going. I had a very close
                    friend who has been a friend to this day, Frank Meehan, who had been my
                    immediate supervisor in Berlin. By this time, he was up in the Executive
                    Secretariat. After checking with Art Wortzel and checking with my wife, he asked
                    me if I'd like to go to the Operations Center and onto the watch. The reason he
                    put it as a question was that in those days the Operations Center operated on a
                    highly irregular cycle. You worked eight hours one shift beginning at 7a.m. for
                    two days and eight hours another shift beginning at 3p.m. and then another
                    beginning at 11p.m. Then you had two days off and started again. Days of the
                    week had no meaning anymore. Neither did hours of the day or night. Nonetheless
                    it certainly had the desired therapeutic effect. The job was very stimulating,
                    very demanding. Even with my infirmities, I really enjoyed it and did well. One
                    of the most exciting nights of my 30 years in the Foreign Service occurred in
                    September 1968. I was in charge of the watch team when word came that the Warsaw
                    Pact had invaded Czechoslovakia. That was a night to remember. We would have
                    gone off duty at 11:00 p.m. The normal rule was, no matter what was going on,
                    you just handed over to the next watch and they took it from there. But not that
                    night. All hell broke loose and the Operations Center was filled with very
                    important people and a lot of FLASH messages. That was the first time I ever
                    received a CRITIC message.</p>

                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: The invasion itself? I can't pretend to any expertise on that. The
                    experts in Washington in the intelligence community everywhere were split right
                    down the middle between those who argued that the Soviets had such a stake in
                    economic, commercial, and other relationships with the West that they wouldn't
                    jeopardize that to put down the Prague Spring. On the other side of the equation
                    were those, including my friend Frank Meehan, who argued that ideology and Party
                    supremacy came first regardless and in a case like this dealing with heresy and
                    a threat to orthodoxy, the Soviet leadership would not tolerate it and would put
                    it down. Sadly, they were proven right. I can't say that I lined up on one side
                    or the other. I just didn't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any thought of what we would do outside of
                        makinnoises?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Our thinking was overshadowed by lingering guilt that we had led the
                    Hungarians to believe that if they rose up, we would go to their aid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about '56.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Yes. So, this time around, I don't think that was seriously considered.
                    The spheres of influence were clearly drawn. But it was a bitter disappointment
                    to see the whole thing crushed that way.</p>
                <p>You asked what I thought about the East Germans. The East Germans did participate
                    in the armed forces that were posted around Czechoslovakia. It was fascinating
                    too that we knew everything about troop movements, military placements. What we
                    didn't know was what was going on in the inner circle of the Kremlin. The Prague
                    Spring was suppressed. You asked what my take was on the East Germans. What was
                    so wonderful about the two years in the Operations Center was that that narrow
                    focus disappeared now into a sense of the full range of our diplomatic
                    activities. I learned so much and it gave me a real sense of how the Department
                    works, how the whole foreign policy structure in Washington works, relationships
                    with the Pentagon, with the White House etc., and in that context East Germany,
                    Eastern Europe really dwindled. For some people (Dean Rusk maybe notoriously),
                    it didn't count for anything. But for me as part of my education as a Foreign
                    Service Officer, that was a marvelous assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling that Vietnam was taking
                        over?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Yes, increasingly. We had a group up there in the Operations Center
                    dedicated to following things in Vietnam. I saw the impact it had on CIA, on the
                    military, on military intelligence. It skewed an awful lot of things because so
                    many competing resources were dedicated to Vietnam.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there at the time of the Tet offensive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: The impact was shattering. It's ironic to see the analyses in
                    retrospect. Militarily Tet was a failure, but psychologically it was a turn of
                    events in the whole of Vietnam and our decision to pull out. It was also
                    interesting to be there for the change of administration. You had the November
                    election and the new administration coming in. How the wheels of government
                    grind to a stop, less and less and less happening and then nothing happening and
                    things just deathly quiet through the night when normally it was a beehive of
                    activity. Then the new administration coming in. You weren't aware of it at the
                    time, but Kissinger set Rogers to work on all kinds of analyses, studies, and
                    paperwork, and got the whole State Department churned up doing things that were
                    ultimately meaningless. It was all part of his way of concentrating power in the
                    NSC and in his own hands. But I was one year as captain of a watch team. There
                    were wonderful people assigned to the Operations Center. They were young and
                    cream of the crop and very intelligent, energetic. For my second year I was
                    senior editor and didn't have the crazy hours. I edited the daily report and the
                    weekly coverage that came out of the Ops Center and other things. Those were two
                    wonderful years.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was 1968-1970.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Yes. It would have been the summer of '68 to the summeof '70.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you get any feel towards the end about the rivalry between the NSC and the
                    State Department? Was there a feeling of being bypassed?</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Absolutely. More than a feeling. It hit you in the facall the time.</p>
                <p>Q: I would think that in the Ops Center you would be presenting paperbecause the
                    NSC is not equipped to deal with the world or somethinthat probably would be
                    read by the major players.</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Yes, I suppose so. But the paper trail is one thing anthe power
                    relationship is quite another.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the summer of '70, what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: I went to the Board of Examiners. John Stutesman was heading it up
                    then. He had taken over shortly before. This was going to be his first full
                    cycle. He had recruited me a year in advance. I wasn't at all sure that that's
                    what I wanted to do. Having been right in the mainstream of things substantive,
                    I felt this might be something of a sidetrack. On the other hand, John was and
                    no doubt still is a powerful, charismatic personality who just energizes
                    everybody around him.</p>
                <p>Q: He's one of these people who thinks in terms of the Foreign Service as an
                    entity and trying to do something for it. Very few do. They're either hooked on
                    policy or their own career. Could you talk a little about him?</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Okay. Before I go to John Stutesman, just a final footnote on Vietnam
                    and the damage it did. In many ways, it was most damaging to CIA because so many
                    of their best people were diverted there and many of them left as a result. At
                    that time, we were all susceptible to assignment to Vietnam. I knew that if I
                    were assigned, I would leave the Foreign Service. It was not based on
                    ideological, moral, or other grounds. It was simply I would not have been
                    willing to leave my wife and five small children and go to Vietnam. Probably for
                    health reasons they wouldn't have wanted me anyway. But many officers were faced
                    with that kind of a terrible decision. CIA devoted all those resources in order
                    to counteract the reporting by the military intelligence. Much of it was skewed
                    to say what people wanted to hear.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>Back to John Stutesman. What he did on the Board of Examiners was just so
                    exciting. He was looking to revitalize the exam system. He had all of the
                    examiners go through the entire process of applying all over again. We literally
                    had to fill out the basic application form, the papers required for the security
                    check, and then he made us sit the written exam, which for some was very
                    embarrassing. Then we got to the interview stage. I remembered my own interview
                    back in 1954, which was all too typical at the time. Three men sitting across
                    you and you were made to feel as uncomfortable as possible with the one in front
                    of you shuffling through papers endlessly and you wondering, “Didn't he even
                    look at this before you came in the room” to the ones on either side of him just
                    staring at you and then the silly trickster who used to say, “Would you mind
                    opening the window” and you'd go and try to open the window and it was locked
                    shut. John Stutesman's belief was that you don't find out what you need to find
                    out about a person that way. You find out by making the person feel comfortable,
                    opening up to talk to you. So, one of the things we did seemed kind of
                    superficial, but he created a different atmosphere in the room. You had a sofa,
                    chairs, a lamp, and it was made to feel like someone's living room. You didn't
                    sit on the panel three across but were scattered around the room. Secondly, you
                    engaged in some light conversation to begin with and then the first serious
                    question you always pitched to the person's specialty. They had done their
                    doctorate in such and such. Or they declared this to be a major interest. You
                    gave them a chance to expand on what they really knew thoroughly. It gave you a
                    better sense of how articulate they were. Then you could do some gentle
                    cross-examining. Then the more interesting the candidate seemed to be, the more
                    you stepped up the level of questioning. I thought you found out a lot more
                    about these people. That was all John's approach. He had revamped the format,
                    the style, and so on. We were in separate panels because by that time the cone
                    system had been introduced (political, economic, consular, and administrative
                    cone). I headed up the political panel. We traveled around the U.S. I was so
                    impressed with the caliber of people we were attracting. These were many of the
                    best and the brightest. The most difficult part of my job as chairman, besides
                    conducting an interview, came when it was all over. Many more failed than
                    passed, and for the most part these were young people who had only known
                    success, and the idea of being turned down was devastating. If the panel reached
                    the conclusion that a candidate didn't qualify and probably never would, you had
                    to let the person down in a way that left his self-esteem intact. It was always
                    done one on one. If, however, the panel judged the candidate to be a potential
                    contender but not quite ready yet, you had to be realistic in what sort of
                    advice to give. It's cheap to say, “Well, you didn't make it, but try again
                    sometime” if there's no hope. That's just not fair. If, on the other hand, there
                    is a chance, then you've got to be specific. Maybe it's more life experience,
                    maybe going into the Peace Corps for two years and come back. It depends. I
                    found that enormously satisfying. I enjoyed that job as much as anything I've
                    done in the Foreign Service. It lasted a year. I was together with some
                    wonderful people, most memorably Melissa Wells. We became fast friends. She is
                    the daughter of a great soprano and MGM star. When I was a teenager, I had a
                    crush on her mother.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was her mother?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: Her mother was Milija Korjus from somewhere in the Baltic. Melissa is
                    ambassador now to a Baltic country, either Estonia or Latvia, and that is where
                    her mother came from. She starred in “The Great Waltz.” She was the other woman.
                    Louise Rainer was Johann Strauss' wife. So, one of the nice fringe benefits of
                    that job besides spending a year working with Melissa was also meeting her
                    mother out in California and spending an evening with her. Great fun. So that
                    was the year on the Board of Examiners. I'm full of admiration for John
                    Stutesman.</p>
                <p>Q: This was '71-'71. Looking at the candidates, what was the impact of the
                    Vietnam War? We were beginning to pull out of there, but it was still a period
                    of conflict. You had the Kent State shootings and all.</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: That is hard to assess. I suspect those who were most upset by the war
                    probably didn't come forward as candidates. But it was not a dominant theme.
                    What was new to me compared to my generation going in 15 years earlier was the
                    concern the candidates had about this as a career. It wasn't a vocation. They
                    wanted very much to come. They were very interested in foreign affairs. But you
                    got questions such as, “What are my retirement benefits?” That would have been
                    unthinkable in my day. Another was “What about my spouse? Can my spouse work?” I
                    believe this was about the time of the Macomber edict liberating Foreign Service
                    spouses. In my day, my wife got evaluated in my efficiency report. She was an
                    adjunct and the Foreign Service prided itself on getting two for the price of
                    one. By the time these young people came forward, that was dead. But Vietnam as
                    such, no, I can't say I recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you notice any regional differences when you
                        traveled?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Yes. Again, not surprising, once you were out of the Eastern
                    metropolitan areas (Washington, New York, and so on), the knowledge of current
                    events was not so strong. When we got to current events in the oral exam, we
                    would often get a very defensive cry of anguish. “How are we supposed to know
                    something like that? We don't get that in our papers here.” It's not an entirely
                    legitimate excuse, but it certainly was a factor.</p>
                <p>Q: I was on the Board panel. I remember going to California and interviewing
                    people who were really top rate from Stanford and all this and yet there was an
                    appreciable difference. Some of these people were from New England, but it's
                    almost as though they had spent too much time surfing or hiking in the
                    mountains. On my panel, two of us had lived an appreciable part of our early
                    youth in California. It was different.</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1971, whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: National War College.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was your walking?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: I was taking therapy. I went to the Arthritis Rehabilitation Center.
                    Ankylosing spondylitis, in the days before they knew how to treat it, resulted
                    in the stiffening of the spine to the point where it was just like a steel pole
                    up your back. Gradually, it was easing. I was able to make do with one cane and
                    then finally I dispensed with the cane, although I still hobbled a bit. I was on
                    my way to a cure, but I still had relapses even after I went back overseas,
                    which was in 1972. But to all intents and purposes, I was functional by the time
                    I left the watch or I don't think I could have taken the rigors of all that
                    travel around the U.S.</p>
                <p>The National War College was 1971-1972. Again, a different kind of a revelation
                    to me. I think that course is the finest tribute to the Pentagon and to our
                    armed services that you can find, that the leadership of our military not only
                    is prepared to do this but feels the need to do it for their senior officers.
                    The training is designed for those who are going to be the future admirals and
                    generals. The civilians make up 25% of the class and are really there as
                    leavening in the dough. Included are people from the State Department, the CIA,
                    and a number of other civilian intelligence agencies. The curriculum
                    deliberately exposes these future leaders of the military to the widest possible
                    spectrum of political views. We even had a day with Allard Lowenstein.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The great challenger of the government.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: And others. Civil rights leaders et al. I thought it was a wonderful
                    thing. I learned a lot about the military side of the equation, about the budget
                    of the military and logistics. I enjoyed the camaraderie and the interaction of
                    the services. I came away with an enhanced respect for military officers.
                    Perhaps the most surprising thing was when we would do exercises of one kind or
                    another and we would all have to do role playing and then would be confronted
                    with a crisis here, there, or somewhere else. Almost without exception, the
                    hawks were civilians and the doves were military. The civilians were ready to
                    send in the Air Force, bomb away, send in troops. Then the military officers
                    would always pose the difficult questions. How much? How many? If you get them
                    in, what are the consequences? What is stage two and stage three? How do you get
                    them back out again? Very revealing. Unfortunately, at key times in our history,
                    the people in decision-making hadn't gone to the National War College. So, that
                    really is my comment on that. In those years, they still could afford to send
                    the students on trips overseas. I chose Africa. Most people wanted to go to
                    Europe or Asia and some to Latin America, but I had not ever been in Africa. I
                    went around trying to get an onward assignment and went to the Bureau of African
                    Affairs thinking they would snap me up. I got there and they said, “Well, you
                    have no African experience.” So, it was unlikely I was going to go. The trip was
                    just superb. In the course of it, we met General Gowan of Nigeria; Idi Amin of
                    Uganda; Emperor Haile Selassie; we met Portuguese military officers in
                    Mozambique, who were obsessed with the threat of Communist world domination and
                    how they were one of the last dikes against it; all these different stops with
                    world famous figures. We had a day with Idi Amin on the shores of Lake Victoria
                    where the government house is and were treated to a very pleasant lunch. Then he
                    held forth for several hours. It was fascinating. In the course of the Q's and
                    A's, he started as a genial tough guy but gradually the madness came through. It
                    was absolutely chilling. I had the temerity to ask a question about his
                    relationship with Israel. He immediately jumped to the conclusion that I was
                    Jewish and said as much. “I can see that you're an Israeli,” he said to me,
                    “But” and then he talked about this love-hate relationship that he had. The
                    Israelis had really been very helpful to Uganda in the early stages.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Absolutely. And then when it suited his purposes, hturned on them. Of
                    course, now they were the devil incarnate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this before or after the Entebbe raid where the

                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: I remember the Entebbe raid. I don't remember the timing, but by the
                    time we were there, his relationship with Israel had gone seriously bad. Here we
                    were in the tropics and you could feel the temperature in the room going down.
                    It was so chilling. He talked non-stop for a long time. After that there were no
                    more questions.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>Q: What about when you were in Mozambique talking to the Portuguese? Here you
                    were, mainly a military group, all of whom probably had Vietnam- I would have
                    thought there would have been an interesting dialogue of_ We were still in
                    Vietnam, but we basically pulled out.</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: No, there was very little reference to that. This was clearly the
                    mentality of people dancing on the edge of a volcano. The end was coming. They
                    blindly refused to see it or to prepare for it. They were obsessed and they
                    thought that we would respond to the sense that they were last ditch holdouts
                    against communist dominion of the world. I remember the charts they unfolded
                    with great red arrows sweeping over Africa and there they were, holding on.</p>
                <p>Haile Selassie, that was very special being received by him. It was during his
                    last days. He was overthrown maybe a year later. Going into the palace past
                    leopards he had on a leash at the entrance. I thought that they did an excellent
                    job in lining up top level people for us to meet, access to them for probing
                    questions. It was a grand finale to what had been a superb year.</p>
                <p>Q: During this period, 1971-1972, in your discussions or seminars, did you come
                    across_ This was a very critical time for our military. Our military was falling
                    apart because of the Vietnam experience. The troops were rebellious. The
                    military had lost much of its glow with the American public. It was about ready
                    to remake itself, which it did and which displayed itself certainly 20 years
                    later in the Gulf War. Were you feeling anything about the military talking
                    about “What are we going to do?”</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: You mean the soul searching. No, not really. It was there. It was a
                    shadow. But it wasn't the kind of thing you would sit around and discuss. We
                    didn't have barracks to sit around in late at night when these kinds of things
                    might come up. Class was early in the morning. A full day, the morning with
                    lectures, the afternoon with special activities, and then late afternoon you had
                    your homework to do and people cleared out to the library and then on home. So,
                    I can't remember that as being a real theme of the time we were together. I
                    didn't meet colonels who had been identified as future generals who were saying,
                    “I made a career mistake” or “I don't know how much longer I can reconcile
                    what's going on in Vietnam.”</p>

                <p>WOESSNER: I found out that in fact EUR Personnel had me very much in their little
                    index card and as far as they were concerned, I belonged to them. This was a
                    mentality that Henry Kissinger tried hard to smash, but as far as EUR was
                    concerned, I was theirs. In May just before I went on the trip to Africa, I
                    learned I was being assigned to the Political Section in London. My wife, coming
                    from Scotland, was very excited. We were going to London, which was wonderful
                    indeed. It would put her close to her mother. Her mother would be able to see us
                    and the children. It was a Friday afternoon. I got back from class. We're now in
                    June, close to graduation. I got back from class at the National War College and
                    there was a message waiting for me from Joan Clark, who was the head of EUR
                    Personnel. Ms. Clark wanted to see me right away. I said, “Like this afternoon?”
                    and they said, “Yes.” Here we were, approaching 5:00 p.m. and I lived out in
                    Annandale. I said, “Okay, I'm on my way in.” I couldn't imagine what this was
                    about. I knew Joan. I liked her and respected her greatly, but we were hardly
                    close friends. She called me in, just the two of us, and said, “Bill, I want to
                    change your assignment.” I said, “Why?” She proceeded to describe the situation
                    in London, that it was a huge section, a nine-officer section. Morale was very
                    low. She proceeded to say very uncomplimentary things about the leadership of
                    the section as well as the leadership of the embassy.</p>

                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: Walter Annenberg. Of course, the State Department had no control
                    whatsoever over him or what he did. Joan wanted to send me to Bonn. She said,
                    “Frank Meehan is now the head of the Political Section in Bonn. He's told me he
                    would like to have you serve under him again. Here would be a chance to do that.
                    I think you'd find the work more satisfying, the environment more satisfying.” I
                    said, “Can I talk to my wife about this? Is it a real option?” She said, “Yes,
                    of course, I'll abide by what you decide to do.” So, I went home. My wife was
                    deeply disappointed not to be going to London. But as always in those 30 years,
                    she said, “What you think is best for your career, of course, I'll do it.” I
                    wanted to have somebody I could talk to. I called Jim Carson. Jim had been the
                    head of the Political Section in Berlin when Frank Meehan was head of the
                    Eastern Affairs Section. He was packing to go on a trip with the Secretary. He
                    was working up on the seventh floor at the time. He said, “If you come over
                    right now and don't mind talking to me while I'm packing.” He was a very close
                    friend of Frank's. I went and told him what was eating me up. I said, “We had
                    our hearts set on going to London. On the other hand, it looks from a career
                    point of view, that might be a great mistake and I would very much like to serve
                    with Frank again. Of course, my credentials are sort of in Germany. It would
                    make sense to go back to Bonn.” Jim, God bless him, said, “You will go back to
                    Germany someday, I can assure you. They're not going to let all that go to
                    waste. You have the chance now to live and serve in the greatest city in the
                    world. Frank would be the first one to say you should go to London. Don't listen
                    to what people tell you about the leadership or about personalities or what's
                    good for your career and what's not good for your career.” I was reminded then
                    of what I had been told before going to Berlin, that I wouldn't like my boss
                    there, Glenn Mays; he turned out to be one of the most wonderful, caring,
                    mentoring people. He did so much for me as an officer, training me, my writing
                    skills, etc. Jim said, “Every night when you come out of that embassy, you'll
                    stand on the steps and look across Grosvenor Square and smell the air and say,
                    'This is the greatest city in the world.'" I said, “Thank you.” He went off. I
                    called Joan. She accepted my decision. I went to London. In a nutshell, six
                    months later, Jim Carson was dead. He died in the Caribbean. It was really
                    medical malpractice. Botched surgery. He had an intestinal problem. Great loss,
                    great tragedy. He was a super human being.</p>
                <p>I went to London. Yes, I was the ninth man in the Political Section. I received
                    not one but two promotions in the time I was there. I finished as the political
                    counselor. It was another great assignment. All of the things I had been warned
                    about were just nonsense.</p>
                <p>Q: I think all of us have been warned. My best friend was DCM when I went to
                    Seoul. I was warned that, “He plays his cards very close to his chest. You've
                    got to watch him.” I never quite figured out what they were talking about.</p>
                <p>You were in London from when twhen?</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: I was there from the summer of 1972 to the summer o1977. My tour was
                    twice extended, due in part to the two promotions.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived, what was the atmosphere there? It was
                        peculiar situation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: The head of the Political Section was- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>Bill Galloway was the head of the Section. He and the ambassador had a very close
                    relationship. The ambassador trusted him and relied on him. Bill was
                    extraordinarily good to me. He took me in hand, gave me lots of responsibilities
                    and encouraged me and mentored me. I'm very grateful to him. The downside of the
                    equation was that there was a running feud between him and the head of the
                    Economic Section, somebody who was also very good to me, very kind to me, but
                    the ambassador didn't like him and didn't trust him, and so you really had the
                    good boys and the bad boys. If you were in the Political Section, everything was
                    great. If you were in the Economic Section, you were largely ignored. If you
                    think how important our relationship with Britain is in all fields, that was a
                    great loss.Walter Annenberg was an enormously complex individual. Just recently,
                    I finished “Legacy,” a biography of him and his father. I understand so many
                    things much better now. He didn't function as an ambassador normally does. He
                    had an excellent DCM, Earl Sohm. Earl and Bill Galloway had a good relationship.
                    Earl also was very good to me and took an interest in me. Some of these things
                    sound repetitive, but again and again over the years, I encountered senior
                    officers who took an interest in me. I owe them a lot. Not everybody can say
                    that in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got to the Political Section, what slice of
                        thpolitical pie were you given?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: I was to handle the relationships with the Labour Party, which was in
                    opposition. As far as Bill Galloway was concerned, if they stayed in opposition
                    for 100 years, that was fine with him. Dick Gleysteen handled the relationship
                    with the Tory Party, but actually it was Bill Galloway who kept all the
                    important relationships to himself. He knew all these people so intimately. But
                    the opposition did feel sort of like stepchildren and outcasts. I had my office
                    next to the labor attach�, who was Irv Lippe. There were two during my five
                    years. Both of them had long experience with the AFL-CIO. Of course, the AFL-CIO
                    relationship with the trade unions in Britain was politically terribly
                    important. The labor attaches worked very closely with me. They were not at all
                    exclusive, keeping me at arm's length. I not only attended the annual Labour
                    Party conference in Blackpool, but also the annual TUC conference and was
                    introduced to the top trade union leaders. That was all fun. I asked Bill if I
                    could also establish a relationship with the Liberal Party. Nobody took the
                    Liberal Party seriously or paid any attention to it. He was only too happy I
                    wanted to do it. That provided a very interesting additional dimension.</p>
                <p>Q: Let's talk about when you were there. How did we view the Labour Party at that
                    time? Who were the characters? What were the American views of the various
                    stands that it was taking?</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: How did we view it? Different people viewed it different ways. I
                    remember the briefing I got in INR. One of the insights the briefer gave me was,
                    “Just remember that the TUC, the British labor movement, has not had its Bad
                    Godesberg.” By that, he meant that they had not reached the fundamental position
                    that others in Germany had reached, rejecting socialism and such. There was
                    still this ideological hang-up in the Labour movement and there were some very
                    wild and radical people attached. I think the powers that be in Washington and
                    certainly as far as the ambassador and Bill Galloway and others were concerned,
                    these people were dangerous, hostile, not to be trusted. We paid lip service to
                    the idea that they were the government in opposition and had to be treated as
                    such and we didn't take sides. But in fact, that wasn't true. In my own
                    experience with the Labourites - this may be a slight overstatement - but down
                    deep, you scratch a little bit, most of them (and I'm excluding the extreme
                    left) were more pro-American than the Tories. The Tories still had a lot of the
                    class attitudes and the regret of the loss of empire and viewing the American
                    upstarts with suspicion and so on. This was a generational thing and among
                    younger Tories you didn't come across that so much. But Labourites still had a
                    lot of time for Americans. One of their heroes was Hubert Humphrey - a personal
                    hero of mine as well. I did cultivate very good relationships. I was down at the
                    House of Commons a lot. Many an evening I would spend in the gallery. The rules
                    of the House prohibit members on the floor from acknowledging the presence of
                    anybody in the galleries, but I had a number of MPs who would look up to where I
                    sat and then they would bend the elbow, which indicated I should meet them at
                    the bar. Then they would give me a running brief as to what exactly was going on
                    on the floor or what the implications of some of these things were.</p>
                <p>We entertained a lot, my wife and I. She was just marvelous. I had no
                    representational allowance, of course, but we entertained at home. She did the
                    cooking and served, the kind of thing unheard of nowadays. But then, as at every
                    stage in my career, she was a major factor in whatever success I had in working
                    the scene.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this 1972-1977 period, who were the leaders of
                        Labour?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Harold Wilson, of course, who came up on the left. This was so
                    traditional. I see the same thing happening now with Gerhardt Schroeder in
                    Germany. In the “party of the left” you come up on the left and then once you've
                    got the leadership, you steer resolutely towards the center because that's where
                    elections are won. Harold Wilson was past master at that. I spent a lot of time
                    covering the fight over joining the European Union [EC]. Roy Jenkins was the
                    leader of that part of the party. Harold Lever, Shirley Williams. It was sad to
                    watch but literally on that issue the best people in the Labour Party were
                    destroyed. One by one, they came undone, either domestically lost their seats or
                    were exiled to a meaningless job in Brussels and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say “the best people,” these are the people who
                        saw thias where Britain had to go.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: That's right. Some of the opposition was quite rational and based on
                    the idea a cold shower is all well and good and healthy but not if it results in
                    pneumonia. So there was concern that Britain wasn't remotely ready. There was
                    that element. One of the most vehement opponents of going into Europe was one of
                    the most conservative people in the Party and that was Douglas Jay, whose son
                    Peter was appointed ambassador to Washington by Callahan, but that is another
                    story. I spent a lot of time on the European issue and reporting on it and what
                    it was doing to the Labour Party. There was a fair bit of interest in that back
                    in Washington.</p>
                <p>Q: You were saying that you saw that the forces within the Labour Partwere these
                    the union types who were chewing up those that wanted to-</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: A lot of them were beholden to the unions. But again even in the unions
                    you had some very conservative elements. The two biggest unions were quite
                    radical. You had the system of party conferences, the bloc voting. The way they
                    went, the conference would go. The most exciting time was when the renegotiation
                    took place. Oliver Wright was the primary negotiator and he and Wilson together
                    combined to work out the terms. Even more exciting was the change in government.
                    It was the coal miners who brought down Ted Heath. I lived through that winter
                    when all the lights went out in Britain. I was there when they won the election,
                    when Labour dumped Ted Heath and Harold Wilson came in. I was down at Transport
                    House the next morning with mobs and mobs of people. My wife was watching on
                    television. She saw me going into a private session with the Labour leaders. One
                    of my Party friends had brought me in and there I was when they were having
                    their first planning session. I was well placed with the Labour Party because I
                    had key contacts everywhere, which during the years that they were in office was
                    great fun. So, there was that. There was the fight for the heart and soul of the
                    party. We were at a miners' gala in Durham one year and it was traditional that
                    the head of the party, whether he was in office or out of office, would attend
                    the gala. Harold Wilson was Prime Minister by this time. He attended the gala.
                    We were each required to stand and do a solo song. Somebody did “I Left My Heart
                    in San Francisco.” Harold Wilson stood up and said that the only song he knew
                    was “On Ilkley Moor Bar T'at” and he needed somebody to sing it with him. There
                    was silence in the room. Then I heard a female voice say, “Well, I know that.” I
                    looked and said, “Oh, my God, my wife!” She stood up and sang “on Ilkley moor”
                    to which Wilson responded “bar t'at.” Ilkley Moor is a moor in Yorkshire and
                    “bar t” means “without my hat.” A totally dumb and meaningless song. I said to
                    my wife afterwards, “That rumbling sound you heard was your father rolling in
                    his grave.” She was seated next to one of the communist labor leaders, Nick
                    McGahey, who was a Scot and a rogue of the worst kind. These were unregenerate
                    old-line Stalinists, make no bones about it. He proceeded to tell her how they
                    were going to take over the government. “We will just squeeze and squeeze.” She
                    came to our room that night absolutely terrified. He was just outlining the same
                    thing I was used to from New York politics in the '40s and the '50s. If you stay
                    late enough at the meetings, all people who get to bed at a decent hour go home
                    and then in the closing hours you pushed through some totally unacceptable
                    resolution you never could have gotten passed otherwise. Those kinds of tactics
                    they were applying in the trade union. It gained really key positions. Certainly
                    that did give pause to people back in Washington.</p>
                <p>There were other fun things to do. The Liberal Party was grateful to have
                    somebody from the American Embassy finally interested in them. These were the
                    days of Jeremy Thorpe and before David Steele came on. There were a lot of good
                    people in the Liberal Party, but because of the first-pass-the-post system in
                    Britain, they never really had a chance. I see that's all being reformed now.
                    The politics in Britain will never be the same after Tony Blair. I was a regular
                    at their Welsh Party congresses and a group took me aside one day and actually
                    asked if I would stand as a candidate for one of the seats. I thought that was
                    rather touching.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any major issues at that time between the U.S.
                        anBritain?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: There must have been over a period of five years. Our relationship was
                    not uneventful and there were major things at stake and weapons systems,
                    intelligence sharing, and nuclear issues. There was always a certain ambivalence
                    in Washington. We trusted the British and worked with them more closely than
                    with anybody else, no question about that, but there were still limits on how
                    far we would go, which was understandable.</p>
                <p>Q: This was during the high time of Henry Kissinger. Was there a difference in
                    view of Kissinger and Nixon that you'd get from the Labour side and the Tory
                    side?</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: No, I can't say that. Obviously, they would have preferred a Democrat
                    in the White House. But, no. What was noticeable in Britain as elsewhere in
                    Europe was the incredulity over Watergate. That was much more marked. “You're
                    not serious. You're not going to dump your President.” I remember my contact at
                    the Soviet embassy. We had regular meetings. He was genuinely alarmed. When we
                    were getting near the end and it was obvious which way it was going, I said,
                    “No, you really need to prepare. The President is not going to survive this.”
                    They never understood that. Years later, I would still hear that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “They” being who?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: The British, the Europeans. It was that more sophisticated Realpolitik
                    approach to things. It's the same thing when there are scandals regarding
                    amorous goings on in the White House. “Americans are so ridiculous, so
                    childish.” But concerning Watergate, they could not understand the seriousness
                    with which we regarded the abuse and betrayal of power. So, that was more
                    noticeable than anything that they didn't like in Kissinger or in Nixon. I would
                    say that Kissinger was widely respected. They didn't always agree with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, he was European in a way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: It wasn't so much that but rather that he was a global thinker. There
                    were policies and themes undergirding those policies. Of course, Europeans
                    always wanted to be consulted more than they ever were. You couldn't consult
                    enough. They defined consultation to be more meaningful than the cursory bits
                    and pieces we would give them. There would be an occasional sore place over

                        thambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: The first difference was, I remember Jim Callahan saying that now they
                    had an ambassador they could talk to as an ambassador. He had made no bones
                    about the fact that with Walter Annenberg, you couldn't rely on private
                    conversations being relayed back to Washington. Annenberg just didn't do that.
                    It either went through Earl Sohm or Bill Galloway or more likely it went through
                    the Washington Embassy. But they were very pleased to have Elliott Richardson as
                    ambassador. He only lasted a year. Although he was very active, I always felt he
                    hadn't begun to deploy his full intellectual powers, which were considerable,
                    because he was still investing a lot of time writing a book. It was sheer joy to
                    be at Elliott's staff meetings. The intellectual power of the man and his utter
                    decency. He was just a wonderful human being. He was very well liked. He didn't
                    want to go back. Gerry Ford called him. In fact, he was at our house for a small
                    dinner and he was called to the telephone. It was the White House. I went and I
                    got him. Ford asked him to come back to be Secretary of Commerce and said he
                    needed him for his reelection campaign. That turned out to be totally
                    misleading. I don't know what was going on at the Washington end, but perhaps
                    they needed to find a spot for Anne Armstrong. She came from the Armstrong ranch
                    in Texas and was a big contributor. But exactly what the internal politics were,
                    I don't know. Elliott did go back to be Secretary of Commerce but was not used
                    in the campaign.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: Right. You could do that nominally but be given a portfolio that says,
                    “Help me raise money.” But that wasn't what it was all about. Elliott was really
                    disappointed to have only one year in London and be yanked out. Armstrong was
                    totally different. The DCM by this time was Ron Spiers, who had a wonderful
                    relationship with Elliott and really functioned as the DCM. He was in despair at
                    his early dealings with Anne Armstrong and with her people. I was afraid we were
                    heading into a major disaster. The first couple weeks were tense. I wasn't sure
                    that Ron would stay or that she would keep him. Like so many political
                    appointees, she brought with her somebody from Washington as a security blanket.
                    But I have to tell you, within a year, she turned into one of the most effective
                    ambassadors I have ever seen. She had tremendous personal charm and grace, great
                    people skills, a wonderful way of remembering everybody's name and things
                    associated with them, taking the time to pay attention to junior people at the
                    embassy with small gifts and little tokens of appreciation. That may seem
                    superficial, but it was part of her style of working. She entertained very well
                    but, most of all, she valued the embassy staff and knew how important they were,
                    knew how to use them and when and how to take their advice. Within short order,
                    she didn't need a security blanket or anything else. That was a surprising
                    development. I remember the day she went to the Palace to present her
                    credentials. That was shortly after she got there, within the first month. By
                    that time, we were already feeling very comfortable with Anne to the point that
                    when we were all decked out in our white tie and tails on the steps of the
                    embassy and the coaches came up front, she was in a beautiful yellow dress, the
                    yellow rose of Texas, and I said to the others, “Okay, this is what we're going
                    to do,” and we stood at the top steps on this very solemn occasion, a festive,
                    beautiful day, and we held hands and sang “A Pretty Girl is Like a Melody” and
                    danced a soft shoe routine as we escorted her down the stairs. She just loved
                    it. That was Anne Armstrong. When she left post, Ron Spiers and the country team
                    gave a small, intimate party for her and her husband and we just fell all over
                    her.Then came Kingman Brewster. Unfortunately, by that time, I had my orders to
                    go back to Washington. I had the privilege of going around paying calls with
                    him. By then, I was the political counselor. I went with him to see this key
                    figure in the opposition named Maggie Thatcher. Who could have seen what a
                    powerful force she would become?</p>

                <p>WOESSNER: The election came after the coal miners strike. That toppled Ted Heath
                    and Wilson came in. Callahan was his foreign secretary. Then when he stepped
                    down for reasons of health, I was still there when Callahan succeeded him as
                    Prime Minister. I remember Wilson saying at the time that he would in no way sit
                    on Callahan's shoulder or second-guess him or make comments or so except on
                    Israel. That was the one issue on which he felt so strongly that if the Labour
                    Party were to do anything to make a move against Israel, he would feel morally
                    obliged to speak out.</p>

                <p>WOESSNER: No idea. Otherwise, Wilson struck me as a man of no greamoral
                    principle. He was a tactician, very good at that.</p>
                <p>Q: The miners and the unions_ I've never served in Great Britain and this has not

                    did a tremendous service despite everything else.</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: That's not unfair. And Tony Blair picked up the pieces.Trade unions are
                    no longer running the Labour Party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we view the unions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Just as you've described them, troglodyte, backward looking, and
                    infiltrated with some very dangerous, pro-communist elements. But the big
                    industries were in a period of inexorable decline. The unions desperately tried
                    to hold on to jobs and resisted anything that would have overhauled either the
                    great social welfare system that had been erected in 1945-1951, the
                    entitlements, or any reform of control of the Labour Party. This was true not
                    just of these radicals but also the more traditional trade union leaders. Arthur
                    Scargill was truly a radical and a dangerous one. At the other end of the
                    ideological spectrum was Joe Gormley, leader of the miners. The labor attach�
                    took me over to meet with him. It was after midnight at a party conference. He
                    was very pro-American, old fashioned in that way. But the miners had a
                    privileged position in the whole hierarchy of British labor and they had the
                    wherewithal to hold on to that. They could and did on more than one occasion
                    cripple the economy. They held the economy and the government hostage. I said,
                    “Good evening. Pleased to meet you.” I was a new man and this was my
                    introduction to a Labour Party conference. He said, “What do you drink?” I
                    politely declined. He said, “If you want to sit here and talk with me, you'll
                    drink with me.” He could consume two bottles of whiskey in a night, that's how
                    far along he was. A big, strong, burly guy, tough as nails. P.S. I had a
                    beer.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Oh, sure. That's what I mean by the nervousness, the mistrust. But some
                    of the worst spy cases occurred with the Tory government, so there was a general
                    unease in the intelligence community. How far you could trust them. We had so
                    close a community of interest and there were so many ways in which we shared
                    taskthey would do it or we would do iso there was a lot of the relationship that
                    was in our interest to cultivate and pursue, but how did you guard against the

                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: There was the yellow press, which by American standards is so
                    scurrilous it's unbelievable. The things they were allowed to get away with were
                    just terrible. But the more serious press, “The Times,” “The Guardian,” even
                    some of the locals, such as “The Manchester Guardian” (which became “The
                    Guardian”), “The Glasgow Herald,” maintained a very high standard of journalism.
                    “The Guardian” and “The Observer” tended to be more liberal, left-wing, and The
                    Times more conservative but all of them respectable.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: Remember the story briefly. He embarrassed himself when he presented
                    his credentials. The Queen asked how things were and he gave her a very
                    elaborate, convoluted answer about the work that was going on at Winfield House.
                    He paid for the whole thing and it was redone from top to bottom. The walls were
                    redone with paper that was brought from a castle in Scotland. It was done to
                    exquisite taste and at great personal expense. It turned out to be a triumph
                    when it was finally ready, but in those early months there was a lot of turmoil
                    out at Winfield House. Because of Annenberg's speech impediment and a life spent
                    in elocution lessons, overcoming a stutter that he had as a young man, he had
                    been taught to speak in a certain way which was rather stilted and which used
                    big words when smaller words would have done. He came across that way while
                    newsmen and cameras were present for his presentation of credentials. The
                    meeting was then included in a documentary calle“A Day in the Life of the Queen”
                    and shown in movie theaters across Britain sometime thereafter. It produced
                    gales of laughter from audiences, especially Annenberg's reference to the
                    “refurbishment” of the embassy. The press then seized on that and he became a
                    figure of ridicule. It was so bad, at least according to the biography I read,
                    he gave serious thought to going back, fearing that he couldn't be useful to the
                    administration. Nixon wouldn't hear of it. Annenberg overcame all of that. He
                    left very highly respected. The politicians knew that he was not a traditional
                    ambassador, but there were things that he did do that he did very well, gifts he
                    made for Chequers, a big addition, the book he financed on Westminster Abbey,
                    which was a stunning work. He did lots of good things. He entertained well. But
                    most endearing was a farewell luncheon he gave at Winfield House for the trade
                    union leaders and he began by making reference to the refurbishment of the
                    embassy and his early gaffe. By that time, he was able to laugh at it and make a
                    joke of it. Of course, the British just loved that. His stiffness had
                    evaporated. He ended on a very high note. Not a traditional ambassador, but a
                    lot of popular appeal.</p>
                <p>Q: I take it you found that dealing with the Labour members, you had already
                    established your personal credentials early on. How about with the Tories? Did
                    you find this a different kettle of fish?</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: The relationships probably were not as personal, warm, and intense, but
                    they were perfectly cordial and I had a number of friends in the Tory Party even
                    though I had been poaching on somebody else's territory at the time. Then being
                    political counselor opened a lot of avenues. That was enough to get me in where
                    I needed to go. But you're right, there was something about those first
                    relationships that you established while the Labour people were in opposition.
                    When they became ministers or junior ministers, they didn't forget, and that was
                    nice. That paid off in a lot of things that were shared with me that made for
                    good reporting back home.</p>
                <p>Q: You left Britain in 1977. Whither?</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: I came back to Washington to be the country director for Central
                    Europe, which covered Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. I didn't particularly
                    want to come back to Washington because I knew it would be financially a major
                    blow and we had three kids in college by this timor two and a third rising. I
                    came back in 1977. I was only in the Department for about a year and nine
                    months. That was an interesting time. I didn't like working in the State
                    Department. When I came back years later to be Principal Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary, it was even more pronounced. It was the sterility of the constant
                    warfare between the State Department and the Pentagon, the State Department and
                    the NSC, the State Department and the CIA, all of those agencies with one
                    another. Nothing ever seemed to be resolved permanently. It was just put on ice.
                    I don't remember the issue anymore, but it was something that we had been
                    fighting with the Pentagon a long time and finally a presidential memorandum
                    came out which settled it. Within a week, I was doing something pursuant to the
                    new memorandum and the Pentagon objected. They said, “That is not what the
                    President really meant” and there we went all over again. That kind of thing. I
                    was only there for a year and a half. I liked working with the German Embassy.
                    We had a wonderful relationship. The ambassador was Berndt von Staden. He and I
                    remain close friends to this day. The embassy there has always had their best
                    diplomats. I was so impressed with how well they knew Washington and how they
                    were able to cover the crazy quilt of American politics.</p>

                <p>WOESSNER: It was absolutely venomous. Helmut Schmidt didn't suffer fools gladly.
                    He certainly didn't suffer pious politicians gladly. Jimmy Carter was no fool,
                    but he certainly came across as a real pious person. The chemistry was just
                    awful. Schmidt could be bad, really bad, in his personal relationships, the way
                    he treated people. There were examples of rudeness, discourtesy. I remember a
                    lady in his cabinet saying, “You don't want to take that so seriously. He treats
                    us even worse.” Schmidt was the chancellor and he never lost an opportunity to
                    bitch, moan, and criticize the President. Jimmy Carter, for his part, you have
                    to assume there was no love lost, but I'm not aware of any occasion on which he
                    badmouthed the chancellor. It was a one way street. After every flare-up, they
                    would be brought together and have a wonderful talk. The aides would all go
                    around saying, “This is a new beginning for a relationship” and in a matter of
                    weeks, Schmidt would be back in his office and it would start all over again.
                    But the nadir of the relationship was the neutron bomb. The neutron bomb was not
                    a bomb; it was a weapon. We wanted to develop it and deploy it and the Europeans
                    had a lot of misgivings. Schmidt was crucial to the whole effort to sell it to
                    the other Europeans. Carter leaned on him heavily and against his better
                    judgement and at some political cost domestically, Schmidt went along and the
                    Europeans endorsed the idea. Then you know the famous story where Jimmy Carter
                    knelt at his bedside one night, said his prayers, talked to God, and the next
                    morning woke up and decided he couldn't do this, that it was an immoral weapon.
                    Just a stunning turnaround which to this day nobody has explained satisfactorily
                    to me. It was my happy chore to call Berndt von Staden and say, “Could you come
                    down right now? The Secretary wants to see you.” “Oh, yes, be right there.” He
                    came. I went to the entrance and met him. Going up in the elevator, he whispered
                    to me, “What's going on? What is this about?” I said, “It's about the neutron
                    bomb.” I probably shouldn't have done that. He was my friend. He looked at me
                    and I made a thumbs down. The color literally drained out of Berndt's face and
                    at that moment, the door opened, he walked out, and walked off with the
                    Secretary. Of course, Schmidt never forgave him. In fact, I think the Europeans
                    generally after that had no confidence in the reliability of our promises. It
                    was a long time before anybody went out on a domestic limb for us.</p>
                <p>Q: I've interviewed somebody who was in our embassy in Bonn at the time. He said
                    he could hardly wait to vote against Carter at the next election.</p>
                <p>I just want to add to this that the neutron bomb was an enhanced radiation weapon
                    that was nuclear and emitted a lot of rays which killed people but didn't
                    destroy buildings. From a military point of view, this makes a lot of sense. It
                    doesn't leave a lot of rubble. It was portrayed as a typical capitalist weapon,
                    protecting property and killing people.</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Also, it was to be deployed in Europe.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find that at your level at the German embassy and the rest of the
                    diplomatic establishment spent a lot of time trying to keep the Schmidt-Carter
                    thing from disturbing relations?</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: It was a factor, but life went on. There was such a mutuality of
                    interest that the relationship had to succeed. Professionally, it was very
                    satisfying. I had many completely confidential conversations with the German
                    ambassador or his deputy. It was always honored, respected. To my knowledge,
                    there were no betrayals of confidence. In that job because of the job, there
                    were a lot of other embassies that wanted to see me. There was a Soviet who took
                    me to lunch once a month. That was always fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would we do with the Soviets? At this time, relations
                        wersupposedly getting better. We were thinking of commercial relations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Yes. I probably should have gone back to the Exchange Department and
                    gotten a job. What did I do with the Soviets? It was just information sharing.
                    They clearly were pumping us. As a general rule, in London, in Washington, and
                    in Bonn, I never played games with Soviet diplomats, nor did I let myself in for
                    sterile arguments. Once they started down that road, I said, “I know what you're
                    going to say and you know what I'm going to say, so let's skip that.” I'm not
                    talking about giving away secret information, but I think it's far better that
                    they are informed about the real situation and how we really think and what
                    priorities are than that they operate on misunderstanding. That's just self
                    evident to me. I had no problem in those relationships. They were fine. That
                    goes all the way back to my time in Vienna as a new officer from 1957-1959.
                    There was a Soviet who told me he had been assigned to me. We stayed in touch
                    afterwards for a while until it became politically difficult for him. He was one
                    of the early Khrushchev supporters, professing that everything was going to be
                    different. Unfortunately, not so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Switzerland and Austria? Did they raise much of
                        blip on our policy radar?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Yes. I'm sorry to say that the biggest thing you had to deal with in
                    those countries were the ambassadors we sent there. They were such
                    embarrassments, especially to Switzerland. The stories will make your head turn.
                    One went to jail later and the other just got into one sexual scandal after
                    another. I managed to have two in one tour there. The guy in Vienna was also an
                    embarrassment. It's just not right. I have never subscribed to the notion that
                    only career people should head embassies. I have known too many political
                    appointees who were excellent. But I do believe that it's criminal to send
                    people out who have no qualifications and are an embarrassment to the country.
                    One we sent to Norway while I was principal deputy assistant secretary. The
                    acting secretary patted me on the back when he left and said, “Make sure you
                    make him look good.” That's what you do an awful lot of the time when you're in
                    the field. The DCM is making the ambassador look good. That's not right. I can't
                    think of one single thing that is more destructive of morale than that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anything else that developed during this
                        relativelbrief time, 1977-1979, with Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: I was there until May of 1979. The one thing I remember most
                    dramatically from my last months in the State Department was a call from the
                    Federal Credit Union when they told me my credit had run out and I couldn't
                    borrow any more money. That was the same week that Walter Stoessel called me
                    from Bonn and told me Frank Meehan was getting his own embassy. Frank was the
                    DCM. Stoessel asked if I would come out and be his DCM. It is the only time in
                    my years in the Foreign Service that I didn't consult with my wife first. I knew
                    what her answer would be. I said, “Walter, I'd be honored to be your DCM. I
                    accept with pleasure” and that was that. But that was the spring of 1979.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll pick this up then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is January 18, 2000. Let's start in 1979 when you went out tBonn. You were
                    in Bonn as DCM from when to when?</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: From May of 1979 until July of 1985.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you describe German-American diplomatic
                        relations i1979?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Very close of necessity. There was a deeply felt mutual dependence,
                    much stronger on the German part than on ours, but they were essential to
                    everything we were doing in Europe. I always used to think of it as an East-West
                    poker game and most of the chips were in the middle of the table and getting
                    piled higher and higher. So, the six years I was there were professionally among
                    the most satisfying I had, not just by virtue of being DCM and charge much of
                    that time, but there was so much going on in German-American relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Walter Stoessel was there during most of your time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: No. He was the ambassador. Frank Meehan, my old friend and former boss,
                    was his DCM. Then Frank was getting his own embassy, so he was moving out. That
                    is when Walter called me and asked if I'd like to be the DCM. Of course, I was
                    delighted. Walter stayed until shortly after the election of 1980. He was called
                    back by Al Haig to be number two in the State Department, which was a great
                    honor for him and a recognition of what an incredible ambassador he was. Then we
                    had a long gap. Reagan was very slow in making ambassadorial appointments. It
                    was not until May or June that he named Arthur Burns to come out and be
                    ambassador. I was charge there for about a six months stint. Arthur Burns stayed
                    as ambassador until 1985. I was still there when he left. I was charge and then
                    Rick Burt was named the new ambassador, but I left before he came out. Jim
                    Dobbins was his DCM and Jim succeeded me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's take the Stoessel period. How did Stoessel operate
                        as aambassador and use you as the DCM?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Every Foreign Service officer's dream of an ambassador. No question he
                    was the ambassador. Very knowledgeable. The quintessential diplomatist. Highly
                    respected. But he also was a man who had achieved an awful lot in his lifetime.
                    He had no need to prove anything to himself or to Washington. He gave me an
                    enormous range of responsibilities and a lot of freedom to carry them out. He
                    was very supportive. There was no question about who called the shots on the big
                    things. But it was a very satisfying time for me.</p>
                <p>Q: Let's talk first about the management of the embassy. It's a huge embassy with
                    everybody_ You have the Fish and Butterfly Agency, anything you can think
                    of.</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: I had no idea of the extent, but I think we counted once. There were as
                    many as 55 different Washington agencies with a senior representative there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you deal with that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: That is part of the challenge and part of the fun. You have oversight
                    over all these agencies. Many of them are completely autonomous and go about
                    doing their thing without reference to the ambassador or the DCM. As long as
                    they're not running counter to directives or doing something that might
                    embarrass you, that was fine. But in addition to all those agencies that you had
                    at the embassy, there were six consulates general and there was the mission in
                    Berlin, that all important, fascinating mission post which I knew so well from
                    my own time there. The DCM was the supervisor and did the efficiency reports on
                    the senior officers of all these posts.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any problems with these autonomous
                        agencies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: No, I would say not. The one I found most challenging, no surprise, but
                    also most satisfying, was CIA. They had a huge operation going on in Germany.
                    Over those six years, I had good relationships with four successive station
                    chiefs. They were very different. When I got there, it was George Carver. There
                    were things that happened where they were doing something out of school, but we
                    got that cleared up and straightened out.</p>
                <p>Q: I would think it's always a problem, particularly when you have a large
                    operation like that. At this time, the work ethos of the CIA, particularly the
                    young and mid-grade officers, to recruit agents. This at a certain point becomes
                    almost counterproductive because these are people out there trying to sign
                    people up who maybe we shouldn't be trying to sign up. Particularly in a place
                    like Germany where the East Germans are doing the same thing, you're both
                    working the same field. I would think it would get both embarrassing and there
                    would be a problem of almost traffic control.</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: It wasn't that bad. I think I told you that in my days in Berlin, an
                    awful lot had already dried up. Things were not so free and easy as they had
                    been with spies and counterspies all over the place. No, the intelligence
                    relationship was a very important one. Did CIA commit indiscretions in my time?
                    Yes, of course they did. They had to be called on the carpet. That was hardly
                    the rule of thumb and I never sensed an attitude of trying to get away with as
                    much as they could. It was a fairly collaborative effort. I guess the thing that
                    probably caused the most heartburn would be the back-channel traffic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what this is?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: This is when you didn't want things to go through the State Department
                    but get to key people in Washington. There were back channels established
                    through CIA. The extent to which they were used for their purposes and the
                    extent to which they were used for the ambassador's purposes sometimes could
                    cause friction. I wouldn't want to overdramatize any of this. I was struck
                    rather by how good the relationship was. The other thing was the relationship to
                    the big military commands, the Air Force, the Army; they were all in Germany and
                    headed by three or four star generals. The ambassador had a role in what they
                    did. It's hard to convey just how fascinating and satisfying it was. Morale in
                    the embassy was very high, a sense of being part of a team. The country team
                    functioned very well together. Those were good years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at issues, the first one that occurs to me would
                        be thSS20 verus the Pershing missile. Do you recall that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: That came a little bit later with the showdown over the deployment and
                    the two-track decision. That really all came to a head afterwards, 1983. In
                    1979/80, this was the end of the Carter administration. You had things like the
                    gas pipeline, the Germans selling to the Soviets and causing a lot of heartburn
                    and even good friends of the U.S. like Count Lambsdorff lining up on the side of
                    trade with the East. And also our imposition of a grain embargo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and the Olympics. This was after the invasion
                        oAfghanistan by the Soviets in December of '79.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Yes. I think that whole range of issues, how one deals with the Soviet
                    Union, the extent of the economic pressure, how much you try to coerce them
                    through economic measures, the Germans felt we were naive and a bit misguided
                    and they had a lot of trouble with that. In the end on the really crucial
                    issues, they lined up with us. They didn't have much choice. But there were
                    frictions over economic issues. I remember when I had to go and break the news
                    about the grain embargo to the state secretary, Lautenschlager, an interesting
                    guy, very soft-spoken, almost diffident but quite a force in the German foreign
                    office for years. He just shook his head and said, “I fear that within a year
                    you'll be back and will have taken this off again but the damage will have been
                    done” meaning to our trade. That is as far as he went to voice his
                    disappointment.</p>
                <p>We also had issues with the Germans about the presence of our military and the
                    extent of training activities, the popular tolerance for what we were doing,
                    whether the timing of overflights or the extent of maneuvers. There would be a
                    lot of sore feelings. The military was always arguing for doing everything
                    possible and the civilians said, “Is that really necessary?” But there was that
                    ambivalence in Germany. On the one hand, they knew we were the guarantor of
                    their independence and security and they wanted to give us as much freedom as we
                    needed to maintain combat readiness. On the other hand, it's a small country and
                    densely populated and that was a huge military presence. So, those issues tended
                    to come up again and again.</p>
                <p>Q: We're talking about 1979-1985. Was there the feeling that the Soviet Union was
                    a real menace or was there the feeling that they were not going to do
                    anything?</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: I would never go that far. There was a feeling that things had settled
                    down. There were spheres of influence. We had indicated what we wouldn't do and
                    what we would do or what we would defend. Berlin was a sensitive point
                    throughout this period. But I don't think the Germans ever discounted the Soviet
                    potential as a threat. If we were to let down our guard or if there were to be
                    serious disunity in NATO. It never reached that kind of complacency under
                    Schmidt and certainly not later under Kohl.</p>

                        chancellor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Helmut Schmidt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there still a distaste on Schmidt's part for

                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Yes, that didn't change. That characterized the whole four years. No
                    respect, no affection. But the other thing you have to bear in mind is that
                    Schmidt himself was coming towards the end of his useful life. George Bush had
                    no vision? Well, Helmut Schmidt had no vision either. He was kind of going
                    through the motions. He was respected, but there was no great affection for
                    Schmidt in the party as there had been for Brandt in his heyday. There was a
                    coalition government in which the strains became more and more evident that the
                    Free Democrats were growing restive and the possibility of a switch in alliances
                    was there even as early as the time I arrived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we view Genscher? I assume he was foreign
                        ministeforever.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: He was. He was the longest serving foreign minister in NATO. I have to
                    confess right up front to a prejudice here. I admired Genscher enormously. I
                    thought he was a true German patriot. He also was a great loyal friend of the
                    West and of the United States but he recognized that there were interests that
                    our two countries had in common and there were interests that were separate. His
                    job as foreign minister was to advance both. He was not for the most part
                    trusted in Washington. This seemed regardless of administration. It was a
                    general distrust of whatever he was up to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Because he's devious. He is very clever. He has three pillars to his
                    foreign policy. One of course was the absolute indispensability of the Western
                    alliance and staying close to the United States. Secondly was building up
                    European unity. Thirdly was a very active Third World policy including foreign
                    aid. A lot of Third World issues, especially with people like Qadhafi and things
                    in the Middle East, the Germans were always prepared to be much more indulgent
                    than we and they were reluctant to go along with strenuous measures when we
                    wanted to take them. So, there was always this dual character, but I admired how
                    well he carried it out and how he had this instinctive sense of just how far he
                    could go in pushing Washington and when to pull back. There were people in the
                    embassnot the ambassador but in the Political Sectiowho mistrusted him and did
                    some foolish things and had to be reined in.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say “foolish things,” can you give an idea-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: I mean letting it be known just how much they mistrusted Genscher. Bonn
                    is a small town. Things used to get back to them. They would come and see me and
                    say, “This is not smart to have one of your people going around badmouthing
                    Genscher.” I would tell him to stop. No diplomat should be doing that anyway.
                    Part of the thing is, at all levels of the embassy, and especially among the
                    best officers, there was a whole range of contacts with Germans right across the
                    political spectrum in all sectors.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find the atmosphere there_ It's a small town and you're all sort of in
                    bed together. But was it somewhat the way they claim Washington is inside the
                    beltway, that you got so involved in the central government that you were losing
                    touch with what was happening in the lander out there?</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Not at all. It is a cozy town and there were a lot of personal
                    relationships that did a lot to smooth the relationship internationally. But
                    it's a federal state and you can't lose sight of the importance of all the other
                    capitals in Germany, publishing being in Hamburg, business interests in the
                    Ruhr, the critical importance of Frankfurt and Berlin. After all, distances
                    being what they were, for these Bundestag deputies to go home to their
                    constituencies was not like flying to California. They drove down the road. It's
                    all within a couple hours drive. So, no, I never felt that there was an inside
                    the Beltway mentality. Small town, yes, but not that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the embassy's relationship with our consulates
                        general?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: They were very good. The extent of the activity in these consulates
                    general and the consular duties that had to be performed were important, but the
                    extent of the outreach very often was a function of who the consul general was.
                    The really good ones did a lot of political contact on their own. Munich was
                    very sensitive because of Strauss. We had more than one consul general who had a
                    personal relationship with Franz Josef Strauss which fed back into our own. We
                    never tried to restrict relationships there. In Stuttgart, you had Rommel, who
                    was a CDU maverick, but always worth cultivating. He was the mayor. Then there
                    was Berlin. There, especially when you had a strong minister - and this dated
                    back to the days when I was in Berlin - there was a certain reluctance on the
                    part of the minister to take guidance from the ambassador. When you had
                    professionals like David Anderson in Berlin and Walter Stoessel in Bonn, that
                    was not a problem. I'm thinking back to the days when you had somebody like Arch
                    Calhoun in Berlin and George McGhee in Bonn. Arch didn't take any advice from
                    George McGhee. Those were healthy tensions, let me put it that way. But even in
                    my timand of course it's gotten more acute sincthere was a constant pressure
                    from Washington to close down the consulates general one by one for budgetary
                    reasons. These moves were strenuously resisted by the Germans. I remember when
                    Duesseldorf was reduced to a one-man post and then when they wanted to close
                    Bremen in Carter's time, a mayor of Bremen and a whole delegation went to
                    Washington to plead. “It's been here since the 18th century. How can you take it
                    away?” So, they relented that year and the next year they didn't give any
                    notice. They closed it overnight and that was that. But the important ones
                    remained Frankfurt and Munich and to a lesser extent Hamburg.</p>
                <p>Q: Talk about Berlin. During this time, particularly after the Soviet move into
                    Afghanistan, which came as a real shocker for everyone. We also had the hostage
                    crisis in Iran, which caused_ We were thinking that maybe the Soviets would move
                    and take advantage of this and move to the Persian Gulf. Were we under
                    particular concern about the status of Berlin during this time?</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: No. No fear that the Soviets might do something. I think we had enough
                    confidence in our own strength and the solidarity of the alliance. Yes, the
                    Russians might bring pressure to bear; you had to be on guard and counteract
                    vigorously. But I never had the sense of the nervousness that perhaps
                    characterized the '60s, that somehow this was a hostage to fortune. Though we
                    were in Berlin, we planted the flag. We made clear we were staying there until
                    the end of time the Russians be damned. The climate in Berlin could be affected
                    by the broader East-West climate. That goes without saying. Things were a little
                    bit more cordial, a little bit freer. But the basic relationship was not
                    affected. The real change came when we'll get onto that other subject, when
                    Brezhnev foolishly deployed SS20s-</p>
                <p>Q: We're dealing with this earlier period. By this time, we had been concerned
                    particularly during the latter stages of our involvement in Vietnam and beyond
                    about the American military - too much drug use, problems of authority, troops
                    were not well disciplined, etc. When you got there in '79, what was the feeling
                    you were getting from our military commanders?</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: We went through the phase of sensing that the Army wasn't what it had
                    been, but there was a concerted effort to build things back up again. But that
                    didn't reach its culmination until Ronald Reagan and the sense of pride in
                    uniform. That came a bit later. But, yes, there was concern about combat
                    readiness. The real issues in Germany other than the ones I talked about
                    befornamely that our efforts to be combat ready interfered with the growing
                    sense of civilian entitlement on the part of the German population_ The whole
                    range of issues we had with Germans had to do more with the military staying,
                    feeling happy in Germany, and the Germans went to great lengths in small towns
                    and larger communities, wherever we had garrisons, to do things to make the GIs
                    feel welcome. Of course, those efforts suffered from the fact that the very
                    nature of the Army is that there is constant turnover. The Germans would no
                    sooner get to know the base commander and they would get to know all the troops
                    and there would be a rotation and another rotation. There were relationships
                    formed between GIs and Germans over decades that were very important in the
                    long-run German-American relationship. Today when Germans talk about that era,
                    they lament that it's missing. So, it was more of that nature than the decline
                    in Army moraldrugs, the other things you were talking abouthat was a worldwide
                    phenomenon and wasn't peculiar to Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you noticing a generational change in Germany? The
                        oldegeneration had been involved in WWII. A new generation was coming
                        up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Yes. In fact, it was a theme in embassy discussion. I think it was Alex
                    Klieforth, our public affairs counselor, who first heard enunciated this idea of
                    the change in generations and the need to do something about it. It lay behind
                    the development of such things as the Congress-Bundestag program in which the
                    German Bundestag and the Congress - but it was pushed by the Bundestag - said,
                    “We need to invest in our young people.” They set up a high school exchange
                    program fully funded by both governments to exchange 300 teenagers from Germany
                    and 300 from the U.S. for a one-year homestay. It was intended as total cultural
                    immersion to forge ties in the new generation. The older generation in which all
                    of this was self-evident was beginning to pass from the scene. The younger
                    generation didn't have that personal contact.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>To come back to the GIs for a moment, another thing that had changed was, in the
                    '50s and the '60s, the income of an American soldier went a long way in Germany.
                    With the great prosperity in Germany, by the time you got to the end of the
                    '70s/beginning of the '80s, you had situations where if a GI had his family in
                    Germany with him, his wife might have to go out and be a Putzfrau to a German
                    family. This is a role reversal. GIs didn't have the disposable income to go
                    into town and do things. More and more, they stayed on base not because they
                    were less interested in knowing about Germany or having a good time but because
                    they couldn't afford it. Again, this gave an impetus to the mayor, to all kinds
                    of German civic organizations, to do things for the GIs, to make them feel
                    welcome here. It was kind of fighting a tide and the tide was pushed by the
                    discrepancy in income.</p>
                <p>Q: There was another thing, too. As an enlisted man, I was in Darmstadt and
                    Lunsberg. Although I enlisted, it was either that or be drafted. So, a
                    significant number of young American males had served in Germany in the post-war
                    period, but now we had a professional army and so we no longer had this tie.</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: That is part of the weakening of the tie. The GIs who went in the
                    heyday of all this said, “Gosh, the Germans are really not so bad. They're a lot
                    like us.” That was the attitude. A number of them married German girls. It was a
                    close relationship. That was changing in the '70s and '80s. We in the embassy
                    were very aware of it. We devoted a lot of time and resources to public
                    diplomacy. One other thing by this period, the generation of '68 was coming into
                    its own. It was the product of the fame“march through the institutions,” a
                    left-wing effort to infiltrate and take over the media, especially TV, the
                    church (oddly enough), and institutions of higher education. Among young German
                    intellectuals, self-styled intellectuals, it was fashionable to be highly
                    critical of the U.S. Part of that came from the Vietnam experience, but it was a
                    march through the institutions. We were beginning to see the fruits of that by
                    the late '70s and early '80s. Those who had been the protestors of '68 now were
                    in positions of middle management or other influence in the TV stations. It was
                    a time that called for strong public diplomacy and we were fortunate to have
                    Alex Klieforth. After Alex, Tom Tuch was there throughout the Burns era. That
                    was a marriage made in heaven.</p>
                <p>Q: Tourism was picking up around the world. Particularly Americans were going.
                    It's London, Paris, and Rome, maybe the south, but Germany is almost considered
                    to be an expensive place. Was this of concern?</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: No. We were not in the tourism business. We werinvolved in improving
                    the whole range of relationships with Germany.</p>
                <p>Q: Tourism is one part of it. When you get a group of middle Americans who were
                    on vacation to go to Germany, they'll come back more favorably concerned with
                    Germany.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: That may be. There are limits to what an embassy can do. We did have a
                    very active public diplomacy campaign and we did push hard for things like the
                    Congress-Bundestag program. It just made so much sense and the Germans wanted
                    it. The same thing with visits from congressional delegations. All these junkets
                    and boondoggles. I had been in London and know they poured out of the plane and
                    they said, “Okay, boy, where is the money?” They wanted their per diem and they
                    weren't there for any serious business. I dare say Paris and Rome were much the
                    same. When they came to Bonn, you knew they had a serious purpose because there
                    wasn't much nightlife in Bonn. The Germans were always pushing, especially the
                    Bundestag deputies, “Why don't American congressmen come here in greater
                    numbers?” The one event that would attract the stars from Washington would be
                    the Wehrkunde conference in Munich every February. John Tower led the delegation
                    in the early years. That was always a very serious exchange of views among
                    thinkers and policy makers in the various NATO countries. But otherwise, top
                    congressional leaders rarely came to Bonn. It was a source of concern to the
                    Germans. The other side of the equation is that Bundestag deputies would flock
                    to Washington. The poor German embassy here spent a disproportionate amount of
                    its time on the care and feeding of Bundestag deputies and as often as not, they
                    would go home very angry with the embassy because it had not been able to get
                    them the level of high attention that they expected, setting up appointments. It
                    was often very embarrassing. I experienced that from my time in the State
                    Department working closely with the German embassy and I know from the other end
                    in Bonn. Not good. Germany was just one more ally as far as the Hill was
                    concerned. There was no effort to cultivate German parliamentarians or even give
                    them much courtesy. There were notable exceptions such as Lee Hamilton, Richard
                    Lugar, and others.</p>
                <p>Q: What about commercial disputes? Were there concerns about too many Mercedes
                    being sold in the U.S. or the flow of goods? Was this a problem?</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: No, I can't recall that we would object to German exportto the United

                <p>WOESSNER: Yes, and the Japanese were everybody's favorite scapegoat. The
                    Europeans could complain about that, too. So, we all dumped on the Japanese.
                    But, no, the issues had much more to do with trade to third countries and the
                    political implications of that and using trade as a political weapon. The
                    Germans would resist those efforts and the Europeans in general would. But I
                    can't recall that we ever complained to the Germans that they were sending too
                    much to us. There are trade issues with the EU. That is a whole chapter unto

                <p>WOESSNER: Right. Most of those things would be handled in Brussels. That was not
                    a major preoccupation of the embassy. Depending on the issue, we might have to
                    lend strength to something with a demarche or so, but the embassy's focus was
                    very heavily on political, military, and strategic issues.</p>

                <p>WOESSNER: No, not really. That was a favorite subject that would appear now and
                    again in some columnist's writings, but the solidarity of the Western alliance
                    was never really called into question. There was no fear that the Germans could
                    or would strike a deal with Moscow, exchanging trade concessions and unification
                    for some form of neutrality.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also, looking back at the time, was the thought of Germany
                        beinunified in your lifetime thought of as a possibility?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: I fancied myself as being something of an expert on Germany and I KNEW
                    that they wouldn't achieve unification in my lifetime. It was as straightforward
                    and simple as that. I think I was still making those kind of categorical
                    statements 12 months before the wall came down and I was out of the Foreign
                    Service. An interesting fact about the East German-West German relationship I
                    don't think was always fully appreciated in the West is that the GDR, East
                    Germany, was in fact getting a free ride on the EU. It had all the advantages of
                    membership without any of the payment. It all came through what they called
                    “Interzonenhandel” (interzonal trade), but that was just part of an enormous
                    subsidization of the East German economy by the West Germans. More and more and
                    more money was poured into East Germany to alleviate the hardships of the
                    population. There were people at the time who questioned why on earth do you
                    want to subsidize this totalitarian regime that is so hostile? But in the end,
                    that degree of subsidization was so heavy that it really weakened the East
                    Germans, so when the fall came, it came hard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time, were we still seeing East Germany as
                        being morof an economic powerhouse than it actually was?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: Yes. Our intelligence was badly at fault here. To an amazing extent, we
                    accepted the East Germans' own claims for their economic prosperity. It always
                    would be listed as the tenth industrial power in the world. It was all
                    fraudulent.</p>
                <p>Q: To what would you ascribe the wholnot just the U.S., but Great Britain,
                    France, everybody elshow did we fall into this? It wasn't as though this was
                    North Korea. People could get in there and see the products coming out. We could
                    count, look, and examine.</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Good question. Especially when you think that we had military missions,
                    cars, traversing the GDR all the time. They were primarily looking at military
                    targets and things of military significance, but you're right, there is so much
                    we should have known and didn't. But then I'm not a great believer in the value
                    of all the intelligence we had. We never had anybody inside the Kremlin. We were
                    never able to assess motives. We had all the external intelligence provided by
                    the things flying around in the sky and when troops would be moved, but real
                    hard intelligence as to motives? No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We can't do it with our own government. Was the embassy
                        ever involved in getting into Germany being used or letting France be in
                        front but using it for doing things for economic trade, etc., under the
                        guise of the European Union that we felt was not to our best interests?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: The German-French relationship was very special but full of
                    ambivalence. On economic issues, the French usually took the lead and usually
                    dictated the terms. We know that was a big issue with Britain's coming into the
                    Market. But on some things and certainly on agriculture, there was a coincidence
                    of interest. The Germans had their own agricultural lobby that was politically
                    very powerful. While you could count on the French to be loud and strong, on
                    that one, the Germans lined up.</p>
                <p>Q: I was wondering whether_ Particularly after Arthur Burns came in_ He was the
                    economist. Did this give a different cast to the embassy?</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: Before I do that, I have to mention my own health. I had a dramatic
                    turn in Walter Stoessel's last year there. I had been at post one year. I came
                    in May of '79 and this was in June of '80. Suddenly, I became very weak. It came
                    on rather rapidly and got so bad that one morning I couldn't even lift my right
                    hand to shave. At that point, my wife said, “Enough is enough” and she took me
                    down to a military hospital in Frankfurt. By the time she got me there, I could
                    not walk and even sit up. The doctor couldn't tell for sure what I had without
                    doing some tests. But he wanted her permission to give me some hydrocortisone
                    because he thought he knew what I had, i.e., Addison's Disease, which is the
                    same thing that Jack Kennedy had. He said, “If I don't do something, your
                    husband will be in an irreversible coma within 24 hours.” So, there she
                    delivered me more dead than alive to the Army hospital and I had the injection
                    and 24 hours later was running up and down the stairs. That was the beginning. I
                    did have Addison's Disease. It is an auto-immune disease. They fixed me up, put
                    me on a regime of medication, and certain do's and don'ts, all with a caution
                    that there could be further complications. Within three months there were. At
                    the end of that summer, I was medically evacuated to Georgetown University
                    Hospital with the second stage of what is an autoimmune disease called Schmidt's
                    Syndrome. The second part is Hashimoto's disease in which the thyroid sets up
                    antibodies to itself. I was slowly killing myself. I was in hospital for two
                    weeks. Extensive tests were run. Then I got the medication for that. I came back
                    to post but it was very scary. I've lived with that ever since because there is
                    no cure for it; there is only treatment.</p>
                <p>Walter Stoessel left the following January, called back as soon as the new
                    administration took office. I was charge until June. In May, Helmut Schmidt
                    visited Washington. He was growing increasingly impatient, angry, at the
                    administration for not naming a new ambassador. While Schmidt was in Washington
                    that May, Reagan announced Arthur Burns. Schmidt was delighted. He knew, liked,
                    and admired Arthur Burns and was just thrilled that he would be coming as
                    ambassador. I did not know Arthur Burns. At that time, he was over at AEI
                    [American Enterprise Institute]. He was no longer with the Fed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might explain who Arthur Burns was.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: He had been advisor to several presidents and also chairman of the
                    Federal Reserve System for eight years. He had been a distinguished scholar and
                    wrote the definitive text on the business cycle. He was a very powerful
                    individual, highly regarded in Washington on both sides of the aisle. At that
                    time, he was over at AEI, a conservative think tank. Arthur Burns was certainly
                    a fiscal conservative, but on a number of social issues he was much more
                    liberal. I was asked to go over and call on him. Fascinating experience. I could
                    spend hours with you talking about Arthur Burns, one of the most interesting
                    people I've ever known, somebody whom I certainly respected from the outset and
                    then came to love. I don't want that to suggest it was an easy relationship from
                    the get go, but the more I came to know him and his style, the more rewarding it
                    was. He invited me to call on him at AEI and engaged me in a lengthy
                    conversation. He speaks slowly with a high pitch, and is continually playing
                    with a pipe that is really a prop. He asked me lots of questions and it only
                    slowly dawned on me that this man had a deep suspicion of the State Department,
                    if not an outright dislike for it, because of the way he had been treated or
                    briefed or not briefed when he went out in earlier incarnations on trips to
                    Europe. So, no great respect for the State Department and its intellect. On the
                    other hand, a very high regard for CIA because they had taken time with him and
                    recognized how important this man was and gave him a serious briefing. These
                    things come back to haunt you. Finally, we were well into the second hour of
                    this visit when he looked at me and said, “What about you, Mr. Woessner? What
                    are you going to be doing?” I said, “I believe that depends a lot on you. An
                    ambassador usually picks his own DCM and it's very important that the ambassador
                    and the DCM be in tune, in sync. He said, “I was rather hoping you would agree
                    to stay.” I said, “I would be honored to stay” and that was that, the deal was
                    cut.What happened after that was, in the end, the State Department wouldn't let
                    me leave. As long as he was there, they were not going to break us up even if he
                    had been willing and then I was there after he left. That's years in the future.
                    His other question was so revealing. He said, “What happens if the
                    administration has a policy that I'm not in agreement with?” I said, “Of course,
                    all Foreign Service officers are expected to carry out the policies of the
                    government and represent them faithfully. If this is a matter of conscience, and
                    this does happen, and were you to disagree, officers have resigned their post,
                    but if you're asking me to what extent you're just out there as a “yes man” for
                    the administration, I don't think the President would have asked you to go if
                    that's what he was looking for.” That is the answer he was looking for. I had
                    early evidence of that. To give you an example, he had only been at post about
                    three months and someone from USIA came to him and said they were putting
                    together a three day conference at the economic institute in Kiel. It would be a
                    joint German-American undertaking and the White House wanted him to be the
                    keynote speaker. The theme was supply side economics. This seemed a perfectly
                    legitimate thing to ask the ambassador to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, this was a theory of the Reagan
                        administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: Absolutely, at least in that first year. Burns was asked by Reagan to
                    be part of a kitchen cabinet of senior Republican economic advisors. He was
                    flown back to the U.S. four times a year to join with these people in giving
                    advice to the President. But here we are, in the early days, and he's asked to
                    open this conference in Kiel. Without batting an eye, the old man looked this
                    officer from USIA in the face and said, “You can tell the White House to get its
                    own whore.” He was in such disagreement on the supply side economics. His whole
                    life, he had been committed to a balanced budget and had seen these spendthrift
                    Democrats just run up huge deficits. Now finally he had a conservative
                    Republican in the White House and he was appalled to see the budgetary
                    policies.</p>

                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: He was the first in that group that I described to you to raise an
                    objection and he was all alone. Over a period of two years, that group more and
                    more joined with him until a majority of them advised Reagan that this was
                    crazy. Then he stopped calling them back to Washington. That group just
                    disappeared. That was Arthur Burns. He took very seriously his responsibilities
                    as an ambassador and constantly defined and re-defined what they were. I
                    remember saying to him, “An ambassador cannot do everything. You have many
                    strengths and you're in a very influential position here, more than most
                    ambassadors.” He had a direct line to anybody in Washington that he ever wanted.
                    I've never seen anything like it. Important committee chairmen in the Senate,
                    key administration figures. A phone call from Arthur Burns went right through.
                    There was nothing about “We'll call you back.” He was a perfectionist. I said,
                    “You have to come to some decision after you've been here a while. Identify the
                    things you most want to do, where you think you can have the greatest impact,
                    and then to the extent you trust me, just turn the rest of it over to me. I can
                    administer all these things and if I need something, I'll come to you.” It took
                    a while until he felt that comfortable. I remember his first press conference.
                    The press attach� at the embassy was having a cow. Here was Arthur Burns, who
                    was then 79. No experience in doing this kind of thing. So afraid that somehow
                    the ambassador would embarrass himself. The press was clamoring to meet with
                    him. So, they had the first press conference at the residence in his living
                    room. Maybe 20-30 carefully selected journalists were invited. They sat around.
                    It was to be strictly off the record. Arthur Burns, without reference to the
                    press attach�, for whom he didn't have very much respect, stood up at the outset
                    and said, “I've never done an off the record press conference and I'm not about
                    to start now.” He then answered questions as completely as he could and with
                    utter honesty. To many of the questions he would say things like, “I'm not sure
                    I even understand the question. But I'll get back to you.” The honesty of the
                    man swept them away. A similar thing happened in a public forum a couple of
                    weeks later. A man from a German think tank who was very pro-American, brilliant
                    but enamored of his own brilliance, stood up and as Germans often do, asked a
                    long, long question that was a speech and at the end came the question. People
                    were uneasy with the question because it had to do with arms control, arms
                    negotiations, and very technical details. Burns simply replied that he didn't
                    know and he'd get back to him. People were delighted with this. That was the
                    beginning of a romance. Arthur Burns was probably the most active ambassador
                    that I served in public diplomacy. The speeches he gave really could be
                    collected and were worth reading and rereading. He put an enormous amount of
                    time and effort into his public appearances. He would fine-tune them, hone them.
                    He had a superb command of language and a deep respect for the English language
                    and there was never a word wasted. A lot of time and effort went into these.
                    Frankly, it's one of the reasons that Tom Tuch stayed on as public affairs
                    counselor after what could have been his retirement. He recognized that this was
                    a man who really made a difference in German-American relations and the speeches
                    were not run of the mill things; they were things we worked on. That was part of
                    it.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>The other thing was within the embassy. I do believe his first and lasting love
                    was being a college professor, especially of very bright graduate students. The
                    dominating issue for the four years that he was in Bonn was the arms control and
                    the INF negotiation, the two-track decision that we would continue to deploy the
                    weapons at the same time negotiating for their abolition. That caused a major
                    split in Germany. We had had the change in government by the time that came up.
                    The SPD in opposition went very heavily against these deployments. There were
                    major demonstrations in the streets. It was 1983. But early on, while Paul Nitze
                    was meeting Kwizinski in Geneva for negotiations, Arthur Burns said to me, “I
                    want you to get together the best minds of the embassy and to discuss this. I
                    want to have a seminar on what is the national interest.” He called people
                    together and just like a college professor, he started taking us through all the
                    things that were self-evident to us, but of course weren't all that
                    self-evident. We had to define precisely the role of diplomacy, what the
                    national interest was, how it was defined, how you articulate it, how you
                    advance it, etc. It was an experience for all of us. That went on for several
                    sessions. With that as background, we went on to the arms control negotiations.
                    We began with a one hour exposition of the missiles, their range, trajectory,
                    the difference in the missiles and the implications for arms control, multiple
                    warheads, all this kind of thing. Then went on to the negotiations themselves
                    and what were the issues that were on the table. We were getting the cables out
                    of Geneva, 20-page detailed things that would just give you a headache trying to
                    fathom them. Of course, Paul Nitze always came through Bonn on his way to Geneva
                    and on his way home from Geneva. So, the Germans were very much in the picture
                    on all this. It was just daily bread in the embassy. Burns wanted to know all
                    these things. I will never forget the day we were talking about the issue of the
                    British and French systems. The British and French also had missiles, nowhere
                    near the arsenal that the two superpowers had, but we were insisting that these
                    were not on the table in Geneva and the Soviets were insisting that they had to
                    be counted. Finally, Burns stopped and looked up at the ceiling and said, “If I
                    were up there somewhere looking down on this, where the British and French
                    systems are concerned, I'd say the Soviets have a point.” Of course, he was
                    absolutely right. That was Arthur Burns. He was very active, very energetic,
                    amazing. He was a workaholic. His staff aide used to say the nice thing about
                    weekends was that they only had two workdays as opposed to weekdays, which had
                    five. Burns would go into the office on Saturday morning and his secretary had
                    to be there, God bless her, his staff aide, and the chauffeur. They were on duty
                    all day until it was time to go home. He had a full round of engagements in Bonn
                    and outside of Bonn. He was not much for the more frivolous things, but being
                    Arthur Burns, he got away with things that others never would. For instance,
                    national days, the bane of our existence. You've got more than 100 national
                    days. Arthur Burns had perfected a system for attending. He would go in the
                    front door, shake hands with the ambassador, congratulate him, and turn around
                    and leave. That was the extent. He never circulated. Their dinner parities were
                    much sought after, but people would eat before they'd go because they had Menu A
                    and Menu B. It was always the same. Arthur Burns didn't know or care anything
                    about wine. There were some diplomats in town who had made their reputation on
                    the hosting of these elaborate dinners. His were very Spartan, but the
                    intellectual meal that was served up was always first rate. Hans Dietrich
                    Genscher had no respect for ambassadors and no time for them. Arthur Burns and
                    the Soviet ambassador were the two exceptions. It used to drive the other
                    ambassadors nuts, including the British and the French, because Genscher was
                    really bad in that regard. Burns cultivated the Soviet ambassador. He was an
                    older man. They would often have private sessions - two old men talking to one
                    another as world statesmen. It worked well. He also had a very special
                    relationship with Helmut Schmidt. Then came the Wende when the Free Democrats
                    switched sides and Helmut Schmidt left office. There is this famous picture.
                    Burns was there for Schmidt's farewell and he went up and embraced him and the
                    two men were crying. This kind of public display of emotion and affection and
                    the new chancellor coming in_ People were saying, “This is not smart.” The first
                    thing that Burns did, he and Mrs. Burns got together with Kohl and Hannelore and
                    they went off by themselves and he developed a good relationship with Kohl based
                    on mutual respect and a fair degree of intimacy. He never had that relationship
                    with Hans Dietrich Genscher. He didn't trust him. It was a correct relationship
                    and it was not an impediment to his working as an ambassador, but there was no
                    love lost there.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>Also an interesting footnote. He once said to me about his relationship with the
                    White House, “You know, people think I'm close to the President. I'm not at all,
                    but as long as they think that, that's fine.” He also had a passion for detail
                    which could drive you nuts. I can remember times when he'd ask me to do
                    something and I would do it and he'd say, “Was I sure?” I'd say, “Of course I'm
                    sure. I told so and so to do it.” He would say, “You'd better check again and go
                    back and see if they've really done it.” I had to go back and check. Then he'd
                    say, “You check once and you check twice. I want you to check a third time.” Or
                    the time there was a very good officer in the Economic Section and there was
                    something he had to do. Burns instructed him and then asked me “Is that going to
                    be alright?” I said, “Absolutely.” He said, “How do you know?” I said, “I trust
                    the man.” He said, “You trust him. I have no basis for trusting him.” It was
                    that kind of maddening attention to detail. It took time before he was finally
                    comfortable in his role as ambassador. One notable blowup was with Larry
                    Eagleburger. Burns wanted a message to go to Eagleburger that nobody else was
                    supposed to see. Larry had established a special channel for Burns, but as we
                    know, even the special channels go awry. This concerned an economic financial
                    matter, dear to Burns' heart.</p>
                <p>Twenty-four hours after he sent it, it appeared on the front page of “The Wall
                    Street Journal.” I don't think I've ever seen Arthur Burns so angry. I had
                    assured him that this would go directly to Larry. He got on the blower to Larry
                    and Larry just ate humble pie. It had been through the Op Center and somebody
                    had leaked it. It was one of those NODIS “burn before reading” things. The
                    result of that was Larry then established a yet more private back channel. Burns
                    was zealous in guarding secrecy. He also was zealous in preserving his
                    prerogatives. As he would say to me, “If you let the little things go, soon the
                    big things will slip way, too.” The loyalty to him was just fanatic in the
                    embassy, a tremendous sense of pride working for him. He was genuinely loved all
                    over Germany.***</p>

                <p>WOESSNER: I had just taken over the watch when I got a telephone call from the UN
                    from Bill Buffum, who was the number two up there. He said, “This is Ambassador
                    Buffum. I'd like to speak to the Secretary.” I said, “I'm sorry, the Secretary's
                    not in the building right now. In fact, he's heading downtown to testify before
                    the Democratic National Committee.” We were getting geared up for the election.
                    He said, “Let me talk to the Deputy Secretary.” I said, “He's on vacation up in
                    New England.” He said, “Let me speak to the Executive Secretary.” I said,
                    “Actually, he's with the Secretary heading down.” “Goddammit,” he said to me,
                    “Take this down.” He gave me a message saying that the Warsaw Pact had invaded
                    Czechoslovakia and that he had found out from the Spanish ambassador to the UN.
                    Explanation? The Soviets had delivered messages to governments around the world
                    but they had no diplomatic relations with Spain. So, they chose the UN as the
                    forum to deliver the message. Apparently, the Soviet ambassador was just a
                    little bit ahead of schedule. So, Buffum relayed the word to us in the State
                    Department. That is how the news came in. Five minutes later, a CRITIC came in,
                    the only CRITIC during my two years in the Operations Center. After that, all
                    hell broke loose. I just thought it was interesting, a funny way to get the
                    news.</p>
                <p>The second one was, you had been asking about the left wing in Britain,
                    especially in the Labour Party. I got a telephone call on the last day before
                    the Christmas break. In Britain, especially England (not so much in Scotland),
                    they take Christmas very seriously. They celebrate both Christmas Day and Boxing
                    Day. My recollection is that this was a Friday, but I may be mistaken. In any
                    event, I was still in the embassy when most people had cleared out. A phone call
                    came through. The operator didn't know what to do with it. It was from Judith
                    Hart. She was a well-known self-styled leftist Member of Parliament, one of
                    those people who fancied themselves. I hate to sound cynical, but unlike McGahey
                    and the communists, who knew who they were, with her there was a lot of
                    posturing. She said that she and Peter Shore, who was another member of
                    Parliament and a very prominent anti-marketeer - both of them were in the Labour
                    Partand the Bishop of Stepney and other similar luminaries wanted to present a
                    petition to the embassy the next morning, Christmas morning, protesting what we
                    were doing in North Vietnam.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was Haiphong.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: Right. I said, “Well, there is nobody here now.” She argued that if all
                    these important people were prepared to give up Christmas morning to come and
                    deliver a protest, surely the embassy could receive them. I said, “I have no
                    idea who might come to receive you, but if all else fails, I'll come. I'm pretty
                    low on the totem pole here.” I think I was first secretary. She harrumphed a
                    little bit but settled for that. Sure enough, nobody else wanted to have
                    anything to do with this crew. My wife was not pleased with me that I had agreed
                    to do this. So, I went to the embassy. I was a little bit early. The police
                    started to put up barricades and a few people were gathering. I spotted Joe
                    Ashton, yet another Member of Parliament, but real salt of the earth, a great
                    guy who had to curry favor with the left but was all rather cynical about it
                    all. So, I went over, chatted with him. We were standing there between the lines
                    and he said, “Well, Rent a Crowd is getting ready to assemble.” Then when we got
                    close to the appointed time, he said, “I guess we should go to our respective
                    positions and get ready for this charade.” He later went to the States on an
                    International Visitor Program, a very good experience. Sure enough, two by two,
                    these people proceeded up the steps. I had set up a table in the lobby. The
                    Marine guards were there. Then they presented this petition of protest. Yes, the
                    first few were members of Parliament. Then there were some trade union leaders.
                    Then there was the Bishop of Stepney and who knows who else. Then it started to
                    get rather ragtag. It was a long line. They kept coming, two by two. Soon, I was
                    getting scraps of paper and things written on the back of envelopes. It went on
                    for more than a half hour. It began to get ludicrous. I wasn't sure how to turn
                    this off without giving them a grievance. So, I went out and talked to Judith. I
                    said, “We take your protest seriously and I will be sending all of this to
                    Washington, but frankly, it will dilute your message if the things that go
                    besides the petition from you and the first two include all these scraps of
                    paper and things hastily written and rather poor.” She saw the wisdom in that.
                    They agreed to terminate the demonstration and went on their way. A prime
                    example of ludicrous posturing on the part of the left.</p>

                    Helmut Schmidt no end. It was only during a Schmidt visit to Washington in May
                    that the President announced Arthur Burns' appointment. Burns came out in June
                    for 10 days and then was gone for the rest of the summer. He always went to his
                    home in Vermont in the summer. He came back and really took up office in
                    September. That was September of '81. He stayed until the beginning of '85. The
                    year of the missile was '83. That was an exciting summer. After he left, I was
                    again charge. I was charge frequently during the years Burns was there. I think
                    I told you I added up more than a year and a half of time as charge. Then Rick
                    Burt was named- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>I had my farewell party on the Fourth of July reception. It was a grand occasion.
                    Perfect weather. Then Jim Dobbins came. He was the new DCM and was charge until
                    Rick Burt arrived and presented his credentials. I went back to the State
                    Department in the summer of '85.</p>
                <p>Q: Were there any things that you recall that we should be talk about about
                    Arthur Burns and German? Then we'll talk about the discotheque problem and the
                    missile crisis.</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: I regard him as truly extraordinary and it was a privilege (and I use
                    the word advisedly) to serve under him. I was happy, blessed, to have a number
                    of really outstanding ambassadors during my career. I have never subscribed to
                    the idea that somehow only career FSOs should be ambassadors. Obviously, when
                    they have the qualifications, they should have a fair shot at that, but there
                    are some extraordinary people from private life that come in. I had Elliott
                    Richardson as ambassador in London and Arthur Burns as ambassador in Germany.
                    They were able to do things; they had access to things that career ambassadors
                    very often could not have. I thought serving Burns was a real privilege. I would
                    say he was universally admired and liked in Germany. You asked about his appeal
                    to the intelligencia, the intellectuals, and so on. Like so many in Europe, they
                    tended to have an anti-American bias on most things. Burns was never included in
                    that. He was genuinely respected. His speaking engagements were always very well
                    attended. His speeches and his written things got a lot of high level attention.
                    I may have mentioned that Tom Tuch, public affairs counselor, stayed on beyond
                    the time he could have retired for the sheer pleasure and privilege of being
                    able to articulate things through Burns, not that Burns dealt with other
                    people's material as his own. He really worked everything over. When he gave a
                    speech, you worked on it and you worked on it and it was redrafted and redrafted
                    and he honed it and was very particular about the English language and the words
                    he used and the precise meaning. There were no unnecessary words in a Burns
                    speech. So, for a public affairs counselor, and for all of us to participate in
                    this kind of thing, you knew you had an impact on the public diplomacy in that
                    country. That was very satisfying.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we talk about the relationship with Schmidt?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: I think we did, the extent to which they were really close friends.
                    There was a great mutual admiration there dating back to the days when Burns was
                    at the Federal Reserve. Schmidt was absolutely delighted when Burns was named.
                    There was a move in the State Department at the last minute to shift Burns
                    somewhere else. I forget who they wanted to send to Bonn. Burns just cut that
                    off. He wasn't interested in anything else. He was going to Germany and that was
                    that. Burns did have instant access in Germany to anybody who counted for
                    anything in banking or finance. He had instant access to anybody back in
                    Washington. A phone call would be placed to Senator So and So and it was not
                    “He'll call you back.” You went right through.</p>
                <p>Q: During this time, you were Burns' DCM. Did he have any concerns, disquiet,
                    about both Germany and France and their social support system? As an economist,
                    the social benefits prove to be quite a burden.</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: It was not a dominant theme with Arthur Burns. He was far more
                    concerned about the Reagan economic policy. No, he didn't hammer away at the
                    Germans and the French and their social net. He did often talk about the
                    contrast between the work ethnic in Germany in the post-war period and his
                    personal experiences of it and how that had been attenuated in many ways. But
                    that was not a dominant theme with Arthur Burns.</p>
                <p>Q: Given your background, were you given any reflection about what Margaret
                    Thatcher was doing to Great Britain? Was there a compare and contrast? She
                    seemed to be confronting the trade union problem head on.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: No question. She made a lasting change in British politics. You see
                    Tony Blair today and you can see he inherited something very different from what
                    Margaret Thatcher inherited. She was a strong personality. By and large, Arthur
                    Burns approved of the things she was doing in Britain. The interesting take we
                    would get on it in Germany had less to do with the domestic changes vis � vis
                    the unions or the social net and more to do with the role of Britain in Europe
                    and what a very difficult partner Maggie Thatcher was. There was no love lost
                    between Schmidt and Thatcher or Kohl and Thatcher or anybody in the top
                    hierarchy of the German government. Maggie could be a sore trial. It was
                    interesting when you had the Falkland War [1981]. Because of EC solidarity,
                    publicly, the Germans supported or did not criticize what the British were doing
                    in the Falklands, but privately there was an enormous amount of heartburn. It
                    was hard to explain, but the Germans were simultaneously attracted and repelled
                    by the idea of using force to achieve a political objective. Military force was
                    something only to be held in reserve, but God forbid anybody should ever use it.
                    When this was accompanied by a great outpouring of patriotism in Great Britain,
                    which Maggie played to, the Germans found that incomprehensible or distasteful
                    because Germany had had that, had had so much of it, where patriotic symbols,
                    flags, national days, had been misused by a barbaric regime and Germany would be
                    forever tarnished by it that there was a great neuralgia not ever to let that
                    happen in Germany again. When Germans looked on their television screens and saw
                    the flags flying and the crowds cheering, they winced. Then when the Argentine
                    cruiser, the Belgrano went down with great loss of life, there was a tremendous
                    below the surface revulsion that Britain had done this. When the British DCM was
                    posted back to London, Sheila and I hosted a farewell dinner for him precisely
                    in the middle of all of this. I stood up and gave a rousing toast to him and to
                    his country and to Maggie. I realized I was not being very diplomatic. But it
                    was something I felt emotionally. The Germans just found it hard to deal
                    with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They didn't have a feel for this rather repugnant regime

                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: No. There was no latent neo-Nazi sympathy. Nor were they were under any
                    illusion about the Argentine government was. It was just a sentiment that surely
                    reasonable people could find some reasonable way out of this that didn't involve
                    a resort to armed force.</p>

                <p>WOESSNER: Absolutely.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: I wondered myself with the departure of Schmidt and the public display
                    by Arthur Burns at Schmidt's retirement ceremony, where he went up and embraced
                    him and both men were weeping. This was all captured by the cameras and was in
                    all the daily papers. It was never a problem. He and Mrs. Burns cultivated the
                    new chancellor and his wife. They had private sessions with them. They actually
                    had a very good relationship. They did not have the shared experiences or
                    background. Kohl didn't know much about economics or finance that Burns and
                    Schmidt used to love to talk about. But they got on well.</p>
                <p>I think we also talked about how Burns reached out to young people. He had
                    sessions both in Bonn and up in Berlin at his residence there, usually on a
                    Sunday afternoon, in which groups of young people - usually each one would be of
                    a similar political orientatioyoung Christian Democrats or young Social
                    Democrats or young Greenand he had a rapport with them. Many of these were a
                    young generation in rebellion against their own parents' generation, but they
                    somehow related to the old gentleman and had very substantive discussions. They
                    appreciated it and it was a good way for him to tap into what was going on in
                    German society. He had a special fondness for Petra Kelly. He had a private
                    breakfast with her on several occasions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was one of the leading members of the Greens. I heard
                        hetalk at the State Department's Open Forum.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: An American GI was her father. She was one of the leading forces in the
                    Greens in the early years. Burns thought her ideas were absolutely nutty, but he
                    liked her and respected her. I think I mentioned that she and her boyfriend,
                    General Bastian, both came to his memorial service here on Connecticut Avenue.
                    It was remarkable. Later, they were a double suicide. But coming to your
                    question about how he related to German society, he did have a knack for tapping
                    into many different segments in society. Being old didn't hurt either. He turned
                    80 while he was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's turn to some specifics. The disco bombing in Berlin.
                        Weryou there at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: There was the terrorist bombing at La Belle. It was a place frequented
                    by GIs. Our intelligence had evidence that there had been East German
                    collaboration in this. We took it very seriously. I forget the details, but my
                    strongest memories of it deal with my subsequent assignment in Washington.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: One of the last things I did before I retired (by that time, I was
                    principal DAS in EUR), I went to East Germany, had a session with the East
                    German foreign minister, and that was the top of our agenda. The East Germans
                    had all kinds of things they wanted to talk about, mainly trade. But we kept
                    after that for a long time. It was a real block to any warming of the
                    relationship with the GDR. They were guilty as hell, no question.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there about the time of the Libyan bombing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: The Libyans had these terrorist outrages from time to time. Libya and
                    Qadhafi in particular was one subject on which we and Genscher were very far
                    apart. Genscher always took the stand that it was better to keep open the
                    dialogue and to bring pressure to bear subtly whereas we regarded this man as a
                    hopeless outlaw and tried to get the Europeans to line up with us in everything
                    from imposing sanctions to_</p>
                <p>Q: Was Genscher what we would call “soft” or “wet,” always trying to talk around
                    things, or was he playing the game to put Germany in a different course than the
                    United States or were there other factors?</p>
                <p>I wouldn't say Genscher was soft. He was very shrewd, some might say wily.
                    Remarkably energetic and hard working. He would wear out three staff aides at a
                    time. Constantly on the go. He had three foreign policy objectives or courses
                    that he was following. First and foremost was the alliance with the U.S. He was
                    under no illusion that to achieve anything else and particularly to achieve
                    ultimate reunification, to which he was passionately devoted, he needed the U.S.
                    I had no reason to think he didn't believe in that. He didn't think we were
                    always terribly wise. He wasn't the only European who had trouble with our often
                    overbearing attitude and most seriously with our failure to engage in any
                    meaningful consultation. We talked consultation all the time, but too often we
                    simply remembered the Europeans as an afterthought. But for Genscher the
                    American relationship was central to everything else. Secondly was the European
                    relationship. He was absolutely committed to the closest ties with France and
                    with building up a separate European unity and identity. Thirdly was the Third
                    World in which he always pushed for more foreign aid, in which he pushed for
                    more understanding. Perhaps that was soft by some people's views. He was not one
                    to go along with knee jerk sanctions. He had to balance these three things
                    simultaneously and he was very clever in doing that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There has always been this stand that the U.S. doesn't
                        consulenough with its European allies.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: I would certainly subscribe to that.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>Q: But at the same time, you look and when the chips were down and we were trying
                    to do that not too long after your timin Yugoslavia it was an absolute mess.</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: The consultation was a mess?</p>
                <p>Q: I mean nothing happened. If you consult with people, everybody feels good,
                    but_ Did you feel the Europeans were capable of joint action?</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Those are really two separate issues. When I say “failure to consult,”
                    there are things in which Europeans had a real stake and on which our action or
                    failure to act would impact them and I think we owed it to them to keep them
                    informed and, as appropriate, to consult and, where possible, to get joint
                    action rather than just go off and do it.</p>
                <p>You mentioned Bosnia, Yugoslavia. That was after I left. I'm not as well
                    informed. But from everything I've read and that you've read, it seems to me the
                    problem there was that not only the Europeans, but also even we never knew what
                    our policy should be. That was understandable. As an informed citizen who was
                    interested, I had a lot of trouble identifying what our real interest was and
                    what we should do. But I would think it's fair to say the Europeans were not
                    capable of unified action. They were going in different directions and had
                    different objectives and were either constrained or encouraged by very different
                    historical precedents from the Germans, who didn't want to use force, to the
                    French, who were sympathetic to the Serbs, to the British, who probably were
                    wanting to be closest to us. Should the United States, could the United States
                    have taken a stronger lead? I had German friendAmbassador Von Staden, for
                    instance, who was ambassador to Washington and then head of the foreign office
                    and was very highly regarded. He really wanted the United States to take the
                    lead in a forceful way with a huge military commitment to straightening that
                    whole mess out. I'm not sure that that was the right way to go and I'm not sure
                    that it would have been politically salable in the United States. He had no
                    confidence that the Europeans could in fact get their act together. But that was
                    after my time.</p>
                <p>Q: You were there during the missile business, the response to the introduction
                    of the medium range Soviet missiles, the SS20, into East getting their act
                    together. Could you explain why this was a problem?</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: What the Soviets had done was upset the stability that had been in
                    place for quite a while. Left unchecked, the deployment would have given the
                    Soviets a great, decisive, military advantage that could have led to diplomatic
                    blackmail. Our response was the famous two-track decision in NATO. We got our
                    NATO allies to go along with it. That is, we would negotiate for the removal of
                    the SS20s and at the same time we would prepare to deploy weapons of our own.
                    These were weapons that of necessity had to be deployed in the Federal Republic
                    of Germany. You could see the nightmare there because it meant that should
                    hostilities ever come, Germany would be wiped out in the nuclear exchange. While
                    Schmidt was still chancellor, his government and the SPD with misgivings lined
                    up with us in this two-track policy. But once they left office, once the Free
                    Democrats switched sides and you had a CDU/FDP government, the SPD no longer
                    felt constrained by the responsibilities of office. They went dramatically off
                    coursnot Schmidt personally, although he hedged a lot of his earlier positionbut
                    the people who had the responsibility in the SPD came out against the deployment
                    and would eviscerate a two track decision. As the deployment date got closer and
                    closer, the political rhetoric and the climate in Germany got hotter and hotter.
                    Finally, in the summer of 1983, in June, Vice President Bush went to Krefeld to
                    mark the 300th anniversary of German immigration to the United States. There had
                    been ceremonies in the U.S. and these were the counterpart ceremonies. Krefeld
                    then became the scene of a particularly nasty demonstration where paving stones
                    were torn up and the cavalcade was stoned and even Arthur Burns' limousine. I
                    spent that day being rushed to the hospital with the onset of severe diabetes.
                    My medical history weaves in and out of all these things. Those demonstrations
                    attracted a lot of media attention in the U.S. and there was much hand wringing
                    and the pundits were saying, “Is Germany going neutral? Is it swinging back to a
                    Bismarckian policy of alternating between east and west?” I thought that was
                    such rubbish. The Social Democrats, the left wing at least, had an opportunity
                    here to gain support in certain quarters because they were freed from the
                    responsibility of office. But that is all it was. The remarkable thing about the
                    deployment and the German action was that despite tens of thousands of people in
                    the streets, despite the high feelings that it aroused in certain areas, a
                    democratically elected parliament took the necessary measures to deploy the
                    weapons, the weapons were deployed, and people's constitutional right to
                    demonstrate was preserved. It was a pure example of parliamentary democracy at
                    work. This was Germany 40 years after Hitler died in the bunker. I thought it
                    was a remarkable testimonial to the stability of German institutions. I said as
                    much in speeches back here.</p>

                <p>WOESSNER: Besides getting shot with insulin? It was a major theme of our public
                    diplomacy. As we fanned out around Germany, that was one of the themes
                    addressed. But the role of the embassy was clearly in the dialogue with the
                    Germans, while the negotiations were going on in Geneva. The negotiations in
                    Geneva extended over a long period. One constant was that on the way to Geneva
                    or on the way back, Paul Nitze or whoever happened to be in charge always came
                    through Bonn. On that issue, the consultations were as intense as anyone could
                    have wished for. The Germans were always completely in the picture and their
                    input was sought and they did have a role in the negotiation of what was
                    politically tolerable or not, what had to be done. They were rock solid. It was
                    fun to be in the middle of that, although I can't pretend that I always
                    understood all the minutia of those negotiations. That was really arcane. Paul
                    Nitze was just marvelous. I loved sitting and listening to him. He even came and
                    told me about the walk in the woods that got him taken to the woodshed. I knew
                    Kwizinski from when he had been the Soviet DCM in Bonn. Even the SPD came to
                    venerate Paul Nitze. He was a rather conservative figure in relations with the
                    Soviets. I was at a dinner one time and the SPD had a huge crowd. Paul Nitze
                    happened to be in town and they asked him to come along. They gave him a
                    standing ovation.</p>

                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: The real drama of the Bitburg controversy was here in Washington, but
                    in the field, it started with the fact—let me back up—I want to say that there
                    was an economic summit to be followed by a bilateral visit from the President,
                    Ronald Reagan, but it may have been that it was just a bilateral_ I can't
                    remember. But Kohl was still basking in the glow of the meeting with Mitterrand
                    at Verdun, where these two men, the German giant and his French counterpart
                    stood and clasped hands over a grave in Verdun. That had potent symbolism
                    considering the generations of tribal warfare between the Teutons and the Gauls.
                    For whatever reason, Helmut Kohl took it into his head that he wanted something
                    equally symbolic and meaningful with the Americans. Frankly, this was totally
                    unnecessary. But that was the genesis of this. He was looking for something on
                    that order. It was finally agreed that there would be a wreath laying at a
                    military cemetery in Germany. That was kind of the background. In the planning,
                    I remember the head of Protocol. I think his name was Von der Schulenberg. I did
                    not know him as well as his predecessor. He was a very fine man. He came to the
                    embassy to make some preparatory plans. Arthur Burns and Dick Barkley, who was
                    political counselor, and I sat with Von der Schulenberg and were going over what
                    the itinerary might look like. There was to be a visit to a base to have a meal
                    with the GIs. At a nearby cemetery would be this wreath-laying ceremony. I
                    remember Dick Barkley saying, “You'll make sure that there is nothing at the
                    cemetery that might embarrass us.” Dick had long experience in Germany. I don't
                    think that even he knew something we all learned much later, which was that
                    every military cemetery in Germany had Waffen SS buried there. The reason had
                    been to disperse them all over so there would be no one shrine that Neo-Nazis
                    might flock to. Von der Schulenberg said he would certainly look into that. Then
                    Mike Deaver came, a wonderful man. I so enjoyed working with him. He was so good
                    as a PR expert, everything from the time of day when things would be scheduled
                    to what the lighting would be to what the background would be. Make no mistake,
                    a presidential visit was theater. This was going to be theater. They had picked
                    the cemetery because there was a base nearby. We went out there in helicopters
                    and we stressed again to Von der Schulenberg about the cemetery. We visited and
                    all the graves were covered with snow. But one of the last things he said when
                    we broke up was that he would go back and check on all of these things. When we
                    piled into the helicopter, I remember saying to Mike Deaver, “The Germans will
                    check again on all the graves.” This is incredible in hindsight. One of the
                    people in his party, one of the presidential advance team, made some joke about,
                    “Well, suppose they find Mengele? They're going to dig him up?” It was just a
                    dumb, stupid joke. Deaver didn't react to that. It was some time later that I
                    got a telephone call from Horst Teltschek to tell me, “It's okay to go ahead
                    with the cemetery. There will be no problems there.” I thanked him. I had a good
                    working relationship with Teltschek. He was the foreign policy advisor to the
                    chancellor, a man of extraordinary gifts, very able and very dependable. That
                    was the background. The other things for the trip were also laid on.
                    The“Newsweek” or “Time” came out with a storor maybe it was on the radio or
                    televisiothat there were Waffen SS buried at Bitburg. The shit hit the fan.
                    Great eruption in Washington. A call to me. My recollection is that I tried to
                    reach Teltschek on a Friday afternoon and was told that he had already left town
                    and was somewhere in Bavaria for the weekend. I said, “I need to reach him.”
                    Well, they didn't know how to reach him. I don't know whether that's true or
                    not. But he called back Sunday night. He had just gotten in and found the
                    message. I said to him, “Horst, there is a firestorm in Washington and it's
                    about Bitburg and it's precisely about the question of who is buried in those
                    graves. You gave me an assurance on this.” He said, “Bill, I got the assurance
                    from the highest authority.” I said, “Excuse me. Let me understand that again.”
                    He said, “The highest authority.” Of course, he meant the chancellor. It turned
                    out later that in effect the foreign office, the protocol people, had been
                    pretty much sidetracked and Kohl wanted to take personal charge of this because
                    his good friend Ronald Reagan was coming and he wanted to be sure everything was
                    in apple pie order. I have no idea why he gave a go ahead. I have a theory that,
                    certainly unlike Schmidt, Kohl was not sensitive to domestic politics or
                    concerns in the United States and would not have understood what a red flag this
                    would have been. I think also he may have believed, as many Germans did believe,
                    that membership in the Waffen SS per se did not imply war crimes because, in
                    fact, in the closing months of the war, many people old men, young boys, people
                    from the Wehrmachwere just conscripted into the Waffen SS and so on.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>Q: I was a refugee relief officer and we had to look at this back in 1955. We
                    found the Waffen SS per se did not mean much. There were some really nasty
                    outfits, but basically the really bad ones were the Estonian or the Yugoslav
                    Waffen SS.</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: There were some buried there who had been in a group that had executed
                    American prisoners of war. Kohl had reviewed the files and satisfied himself
                    that there were no war criminals there. Hence, he gave the go ahead on this.
                    Well, the real drama was back in Washington, where certainly Jewish groups but
                    not only Jewish groups protested very vehemently. Elie Wiesel at the White House
                    in a very dramatic ceremony begged the President, “Don't do this, Mr. President.
                    Don't go there. Your place is not there.” Earlier, there had been talk of
                    visiting one of the memorials to the victims of Nazism, to a former
                    concentration camp, extermination camp. Ronald Reagan hadn't wanted to do that.
                    He said at the outset that he didn't want to rehash those kinds of things.
                    Nonetheless, as a concession, the White House now agreed to look for such a
                    site. But the President adamantly refused to back off Bitburg. Meanwhile, Don
                    Regan got on the phone to Burns and said, “Can't you persuade the chancellor to
                    dis-invite the President?” Burns repeated to Regan what Kohl had told him, which
                    is that these appeals were coming from various quarters to let the President off
                    the hook and the President clearly didn't want to be let off the hook, but never
                    mind, it would damage him severely politically in Germany. That was the position
                    Kohl took. Burns faithfully reflected that in the conversation with Regan. Regan
                    was not pleased. Somehow he wanted to get the President out of this. Well, Mike
                    Deaver came back to Bonn. I had the pleasure of going around with him again and
                    looking at sites that we could include in the program that would balance
                    Bitburg. My regard for Deaver went even higher. At no point did he look for a
                    scapegoat. At no point did he say, “Why weren't we warned? Why didn't you do
                    that or the embassy do that?” None of that kind of stuff. There were people in
                    the White House who were prepared_</p>

                <p>WOESSNER: At one point, the head of that White House team_ They were grousing
                    among themselves about the goddam furor in Washington and all these people
                    making trouble and specifically referring to Jews and saying, “We don't owe them
                    anything anyway” meaning politically. I couldn't believe my ears. An experience
                    that was not atypical. During my years in Germany in particulabecause by that
                    time I had risen to a position where I was privy to a lot more conversationthe
                    things that political visitors from Washington said to one another in my
                    presence would just blow your socks off. It's as if I was a non-person. I didn't
                    exist. I realized after a while, that's true for them. I was of no account. It
                    didn't matter what I heard or didn't hear. There would be domestic political
                    strategy sessions, things about, “How are we going to get her out of the White
                    House,” referring to somebody who went to- (end of tape)</p>

                    the idea that this Maedel, who had no class, comes and is the ambassador... I
                    found that just choice because the Austrians are so class conscious that it was
                    a bit of a glorious joke. She was a lovely person. I had no reason to think she

                <p>So, Bitburg, in the end, it went off as scheduled. One of the things they did

                <p>WOESSNER: Right. And in a big position in NATO. Widely admired and respected. He
                    did the honors for Kohl. Matthew Ridgeway came and did it for Reagan. The White
                    House's version was that Ridgeway had called and asked if he could serve his
                    commander in chief in any way. The truth is that they had called him. He and his
                    wife stayed in our home and it was one of the treats of having an official
                    residence that all kinds of interesting people, as well as some not very nice
                    people, come through and you get a chance to sit with them over breakfast and
                    talk and get to know them. He was a real class act. He did the honors for
                    President Reagan. The trip went off. Reagan won enormous respect and gratitude
                    in Germany from for going through with a visit that could have been such a
                    terrible embarrassment. Kohl, on the other hand, although he didn't suffer as
                    much political damage as he would have if the trip had been canceled, certainly
                    was pilloried for his inept handling of this and having put the President in
                    that spot in the first place. That was Bitburg, fun and games.</p>

                <p>WOESSNER: In July of '85, I had a couple weeks home leave. As a reward for
                    services rendered, I was sent to the Aspen Institute for two weeks of a
                    civilization course, which was great, a lot of fun. My wife was allowed to go
                    with me. I reported into the Department the last week in August. Roz Ridgway had
                    just been named the new assistant secretary for European and Soviet Affairs and
                    I was made her principal deputy. I did not know Roz except by reputation. Her
                    reputation was absolutely tops, so I was looking forward to that part of it, to
                    being her principal deputy, but I did not want to go back to Washington at all,
                    and certainly not into that kind of a pressure cooker.</p>
                <p>A footnote on personnel policy. I was asked many times during my six years did I
                    want to throw my hat in the ring for this or that embassy. I learned early on
                    that this is just a game you play. Lists are drawn up and there is no realistic
                    chance that you're going to get it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These are basically European posts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Yes, I believe so. I was asked about Warsaw when I hadn't been in Bonn
                    a year. I said, “No.” I had just gotten to Bonn and this was far too important.
                    Then once Arthur Burns was in place, for some strange reasoI had nothing to do
                    with ithey would never touch me to move me anywhere. As long as Burns was there,
                    they wanted me there. Then Burns announced his intention to leave. He left
                    shortly after Bitburg. I have a notion it was May of '85. I left in July. But in
                    the last year, I was offered two embassies. I was offered Nicosia. This was a
                    serious offer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is not a political offer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: No. I turned it down. Then I got a call from Ron Spiers. He had been my
                    DCM in London and was somebody I have always respected and admired. He is a
                    truly committed Foreign Service officer in a way that I never was. We had a good
                    relationship. I believe we're still friends. We talked on the phone only
                    recently. But he called me_ He couldn't believe I had said “No” to an embassy.
                    Then he said to me, “I suppose if you wouldn't take Nicosia, you won't take
                    Sofia either.” I said, “That's right.” He was offended. He really felt that that
                    was unprofessional on my part and that I had no sense of Service discipline. He
                    was right in a way. We each knew what we had to do. But I had just had six of
                    the most exciting, satisfying, fulfilling years I could imagine and my wife had
                    done everything to make it work. Whatever credit goes to me, most of it belongs
                    to her. Now we were going back to Washington. I didn't want either of those
                    embassies. She was willing to go overseas one more time if it was an embassy I
                    really wanted. But otherwise, she felt 29 years was enough. She was getting
                    ready to pack it in.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>And here I'm going back to be principal deputy assistant secretary. It was a
                    fabulous staff, an outstanding group of deputy assistant secretaries. Mark
                    Palmer. These were quality people. Good country directors. Rozanne was just so
                    special. So, I liked the substance of the work, the working relationships, but I
                    have to tell you, being back in Washington just reminded me of how awful it had
                    been when I was there for two years as country director. Nothing had changed in
                    terms of the sterility of the bureaucratic infighting. You wasted so much time.
                    Also the hours were crazy. Nobody went home at quitting time. In fact, the
                    workday begins late in the afternoon because they save up all the papers and
                    then they come pouring in. The White House is comingin with demands at 7:00 p.m.
                    and that sort of thing. A number of times I would walk out and look at Rozanne's
                    secretary and my secretary and I said, “There's got to be a better life than
                    this. This is just nuts.” I hadn't been back several weeks when I was the State
                    Department's nominee to go to Vienna as ambassador. I remember Rozanne's
                    introducing me to John Whitehead when he was acting secretary. She took me along
                    to a meeting with the assistant secretaries and introduced me. She said, “This
                    is Bill. He has just joined us a couple of weeks ago as principal DAS, but we'll
                    not have him very long, I fear, because he's been nominated to be ambassador to
                    Vienna.” For me, that seemed kind of going back to where I had started. There
                    was a certain appeal to that, although I knew being ambassador in Vienna
                    wouldn't be a patch on being DCM in Bonn. Whitehead said, “Who is the White
                    House putting forward?” It was Ron Lauder. He said, “Oh, well, no fear there.
                    The job is yours.” Wrong. He hadn't reckoned with Estee Lauder. In any event,
                    Lauder got the nod to go to Vienna.</p>
                <p>It must have been somewhere around February 198I hadn't been in the job even six
                    monthand I got a telephone call from Tom Tuch, who had been the Public Affairs
                    Counselor in Bonn. He was now retired and was a trustee of the not-for-profit
                    high school exchange organization, Youth For Understanding. Arthur Burns was on
                    the board. Kenneth Rush was the chairman of the board. They had had a search
                    committee going for nine months and they were not happy with the candidates that
                    were being turned up. It wasn't until many years later I found out one of the
                    candidates was Norman Schwarzkopf. Somebody said, “Thank God you didn't go to
                    the Gulf and he didn't go to Youth For Understanding.” To make a long story
                    short, Tom said, “They're looking for a new president. Would you be interested?”
                    I said, “I don't know unless I learn more about the job.” So, they sent me a
                    description and I thought the job was made in Heaven for me. I talked to Sheila
                    and we said, yes, we would be interested. Then it went very, very fast. I left
                    the State Department in June 1986.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the job actually?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>WOESSNER: Youth for Understanding is a high school exchange organization founded
                    in Michigan in 1951. I succeeded John Richardson, who had been assistant
                    secretary for Cultural and Educational Exchange the last time it was in the
                    State Department. Of course, now it's back there again. Widely admired in the
                    exchange community. We exchanged 7,000 students from about 40-something
                    countries. It was very similar to American Field Service, but differently
                    organized. But in terms of its animating ethos and its reliance on volunteers
                    and the emphasis on training and quality programs, it was very like AFS and I
                    would say during those years, it finally surpassed AFS in the quality. But those
                    were the two quality organizations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were doing this from 1986 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: 1997.</p>
                <p>Q: Going back to round this up, as principal deputy assistant secretary for
                    European Affairs, were there any issues that you were particularly dealing with
                    during that six months you were there?</p>
                <p>WOESSNER: It's rare that you ever make a difference, really a difference. So much
                    of what's happening reflects historical tides at work. One thing where I did
                    make a difference was on Natan Sharansky, the Soviet dissident who had been
                    imprisoned. It was thanks to advice I got from my predecessor, Tim Niles, who
                    went on deservedly to a very distinguished career. I had a very high regard for
                    him. One of the jobs that fell to the principal DAS was to head up the committee
                    of agencies with an interest in the exchange of spies. State played a
                    coordinating role, but of course, the people with the biggest interest were CIA
                    and the Justice Department. It's entirely possible you could go a whole year and
                    nothing would ever come up. But Tom said to me, “This is one you've got to watch
                    carefully. I can tell you now, whatever you're able to negotiate by definition
                    will be unsatisfactory to CIA.” I said, “Why?” He said, “Because there is a
                    mentality that says that if the Soviets are willing to accept it, you didn't ask
                    for enough. Somehow you've been duped.” That's true. I've run into that kind of
                    a mindset. What you had here were certain assets languishing in prisons at
                    various places. Then you'd try to sweep them all up in an exchange. There was an
                    interest in the White House. I'm not sure how great the interest wabut somewhere
                    over there, there was an interest in getting Natan Sharansky out. Of course, his
                    wife was relentless in pressing his case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he a spy though?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: The short answer is no, he was not. The KGB had become convinced that
                    he was a spy. This was based on either erroneous information or information that
                    they had misinterpreted. But the CIA went as far as I've ever known them to go
                    to disclaim somebody. Usually, it's “We have no comment” as a matter of policy.
                    It's a wise policy. But on this one_</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>Anyway, our old friend, Vogel, from East Germany, was involved. A good friend of
                    Frank Meehan's, he was the master of negotiations going back to Abel/Powers and
                    all that. He got into the act here. There were two Czechs, a husband and wife
                    team, who had been arrested in the United States on spying charges. It turned
                    out the case against them was rather weak. I called a meeting and there was
                    somebody there from CIA whom I knew well. He had been one of four station chiefs
                    I worked with during my time in Bonn. There was somebody from the Justice
                    Department. There was also an assortment of other characters and somebody from
                    the White House, lower level. We cobbled together an exchange in which these two
                    Czechs would be released. Justice really felt it didn't have a case. There were
                    a couple “assets” that would be released from East German prisons, but the big
                    thing was Sharansky. We broke up after reaching agreement that if the Justice
                    Department would chop on thithey had to make the judgement as to whether the
                    case against these people was viable - then it was a go. Amazingly, the next day
                    I got a telephone call from Justice saying, “It's okay with us.” I called the
                    White House and said, “We've got a go.” Then I got back to Vogel. The thing was
                    on track. Several mores days passed. I got a phone call from my friend at CIA
                    saying, “About this deal with Sharansky, we want to add some names.” I said,
                    “Gosh, it's too late.” “What do you mean, it's too late?” I said, “We said if
                    Justice agreed, we'd go ahead and the White House is pleased, so we're going to
                    go ahead and send the word out.” He said, “Oh, my god, this is terrible.” He
                    signed off. The next thing I know one of the big shots from CIA came to call on
                    George Shultz and just tore me limb from limb so I'm told, that I had exceeded
                    my authority and what I had done was very bad. Shultz just brushed him off. So,
                    Sharansky saw the light of day. The exchange was at the Glienecker Bruecke
                    between Potsdam and Berlin. Fittingly by this time, Frank Meehan was the
                    ambassador to the German Democratic Republic. He brought Sharansky to the border
                    where Rick Burt was waiting with a limousine to whisk him to the airport and
                    then on to Frankfurt and on to Israel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He's now a power in Israeli politics.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: Yes, he went into seclusion for several years, shunned the public eye.
                    He and his wife had several children. Then quite a while afterwards he came into
                    Israeli politics and was, I believe, in Netanyahu's government. I remember, it
                    was 6:00 am and I got a telephone call. It was a bright, shiny day in June. Rick
                    Burt from the car said, “Bill, somebody here would like to talk to you.”
                    Sharansky came on the phone, “Hello Mr. Woessner. I want to thank you. I want to
                    thank the American people. I want to thank the American President. Thank you
                    very much.” I said to Rick afterwards, “You can wake me up any morning with that
                    kind of news.” It was a nice final chapter to my time at the State
                    Department.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>And the farewell was very nice, too. John Whitehead was acting secretary at the
                    time. He came to the farewell. Rozanne arranged that people who had served with
                    me in all those posts beginning with Vienna right up through Bonn and the
                    Department were invited. It was very, very nice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nicely done.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WOESSNER: I left with a good feeling. And John Whitehead subsequently became
                    chairman of the board of Youth for Understanding and was a marvelous chairman.
                    He served for nine years and made my work there a lot easier and a lot more
                    pleasurable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There we are. We'll stop here.</hi>
